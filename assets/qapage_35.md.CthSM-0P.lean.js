Lynn began his professional coaching career with the Denver Broncos in 2000 as a special teams assistant, then the offensive coordinator for the Buffalo Bills before becoming the Chargers head coach in 2017.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 6?ft 3?in (1.91?m) Lynn played at Celina High School, and later for the Texas Tech Red Raiders (1988ÿ1991), where he was an All-Southwest Conference running back in 1990. His senior year was cut short by a knee injury, and concerns about the injury left him undrafted. He was a journeyman reserve running back and special teams player during his NFL career, playing for the Denver Broncos (1993, 1997ÿ1999) and San Francisco 49ers (1995ÿ1996). He retired in 2000 due to repeated neck stinger injuries. Lynn was part of Denver's back-to-back Super Bowl champion teams (1997ÿ1998).[2]\\r\\nUpon retiring in 2000, he joined the Denver coaching staff as an offensive assistant and special teams coach (2000ÿ2002), before joining the Jacksonville Jaguars as the running backs coach (2003ÿ2004). He left Jacksonville after being switched to special teams coach following a coaching staff shakeup by head coach Jack Del Rio in 2005[3] and quickly joined the Dallas Cowboys staff as the running backs coach.[4] On January 26, 2007, with the retirement of Bill Parcells as Dallas head coach, Lynn signed on with the Cleveland Browns to fill their running backs coach vacancy.[5]\\r\\nLynn was named the assistant head coach/running backs coach for the New York Jets on February 1, 2012 under head coach Rex Ryan, and was subsequently interviewed for the head coach job in January 2015, after Ryan left. When he did not get the position, he followed Rex Ryan to the Buffalo Bills where he has taken the same position. On September 16, 2016, Lynn was promoted to offensive coordinator / assistant head coach of the Bills when Greg Roman was fired.[6] Then later in September, Lynn was promoted to offensive coordinator.[7] When asked what he wants his offensive identity to be, Lynn responded, \\"I want to play smart, physical football. I want to be explosive down the field... We're going to play a little bit faster and see if we can put a little pressure on the defense. Just execute.\\"[8] Lynn made his debut as offensive coordinator against the Arizona Cardinals, pulling out a 33-18 win.[9]\\r\\nLynn became the interim head coach on December 27, 2016, after Rex Ryan was fired.[10]\\r\\nOn January 12, 2017, Lynn was hired to become the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, the same day that owner Dean Spanos announced that the Chargers were relocating from San Diego to Los Angeles.[11] Lynn's hire was confirmed by the Chargers one day later on January 13 the team's website.[12] Lynn is the franchise's first African-American head coach in its 56-year history.[13]\\r\\nLynn is known for advocating the infamous \\"Ground and Pound\\" technique.[14] He likes to run the ball on offense, and keep the defense rested so they can \\"pound\\" the opposing team.[15] He provides a strong running game and has exceptional run reads.[16] Offensively, his approach spirals off the idea that the running game should open up opportunities for the passing game.[17] He welcomes input from his players and gives them a voice.[18] By simplifying the playbook, Lynn said he aims to reduce the stress of his players so they can execute with precision.[19] Lynn has coached some of the best running backs in the game and has been the common denominator in some of the greatest rushing offenses.[20]\\r\\n* ÿ Interim head coach\\r\\nOn December 30, 2015, the Miami Dolphins interviewed Lynn for their head coach position.[21] He was the fourth head coaching candidate interviewed that week.[22] Lynn also interviewed for the head coaching job with the New York Jets on January 6, 2015, shortly after head coach Rex Ryan was fired.[23] Lynn knew the organization well and was extremely well-respected.[24]\\r\\nIn January 2016, Lynn was a head coaching candidate for the San Francisco 49ers,[25] but removed his name from consideration before a decision was made.[26] Despite not taking a head coaching position in 2016, media insider Ian Rapoport listed Lynn as one of his candidates in a good position to become a head coach.[27] On January 12, 2017, Lynn was named head coach of the newly christened Los Angeles Chargers and one day later the Chargers officially confirmed his hiring as the new coach.[28]\\r\\nLynn has a son, D'Anton, and a daughter, Danielle, with his ex-wife, Cynda. He married journalist Stacey Bell in 2011. Stacey and Anthony Lynn married on March 5, 2011 in Dallas, Texas.[31] His son, D'Anton, played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, and was signed as an undrafted rookie by the New York Jets following the 2012 NFL Draft. Lynn was supportive of his son's decision to follow in his footsteps, and taught him about the hard work that goes into being a professional football player both on and off the field.[32]\\r\\nDuring Cowboys training camp on August 20, 2005, Lynn was a victim of a hit-and-run automobile accident.[33] Lynn and Todd Haley, both offensive assistants for Bill Parcells, were out for pizza after the end of training camp in Ventura, California.[34] Although Lynn has difficulty remembering all of the details, Haley remembers them all too well. After the hit-and-run by a drunk driver, Sergio Sandoval, both of Lynn's lungs collapsed and due to shock, suffered from temporary paralysis in his legs. Lynn would then go through four surgeries on his face, knee and shoulder due to the incident. Haley recalled the night of the tragic accident, \\"The breathing is what I remember, his nasal cavity was open, it was an awful sound. He would stir and not really know where he was or what was going on. I don't think anyone survives that but somebody who built their body for years of running down kickoffs and the things he did as an NFL player. I just don't know who survives that.\\" As a testament to Lynn's perseverance and strength, he was back on the field in a week and a half because he did not want to disappoint his team, the Cowboys. The incident created an immediate long-lasting bond between Lynn and Haley. \\"I will always root for Anthony,\\" Haley said. \\"He was tied up and under contract when I got this job, but he's somebody I'd love to be working with again. Maybe, when he's a head coach.\\"[35] On Thursday, April 13, 2017 at the funeral service for his former coach Spike Dykes of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas, Lynn gave a heartfelt and inspiring eulogy about the work ethic and person-to-person attitude he learned from his college football mentor.[36]\\r\\nLynn has worked under 5 head coaches:\\r\\nPound sign (#) denotes interim head coach.\\r\\n# denotes interim head coach.","context":"Who is the head coach for the san diego chargers?"},{"output":"Sydney's Agricultural Ground","context":"The State of Origin series is the annual best-of-three Australian rugby league football match series between two state representative sides, the New South Wales Blues and the Queensland Maroons.[1]\\r\\nReferred to as Australian sport's greatest rivalry,[2][3][4][5][6] the State of Origin series is one of Australia's premier sporting events, attracting huge television audiences and usually selling out the stadiums in which the games are played.[7] It is regularly described as being the pinnacle of rugby league, even in comparison with international competitions.[8][9][10][11]\\r\\nPlayers are selected to represent the Australian state in which they played their first senior rugby league game, hence the name 'state of origin'. Prior to 1980 players were only selected for interstate matches on the basis of where they were playing their club football at the time. In both 1980 and 1981 there were two interstate matches under the old selection rules and one experimental \\"State of Origin\\" match. From 1982 onwards a best-of-three match series has been played around the middle of the rugby league season for the State of Origin shield. During the early years, the results were extraordinarily even. However, since 2006, Queensland has won every series except in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1908 establishment of rugby league in Australia, the sport's two major states, New South Wales and Queensland, have played representative matches against each other which have continued into the \\"state of origin\\" era which began in the 1980s. The two states' teams are frequently referred to as the Blues and Maroons, reflecting the respective colours of their jerseys. These were the colours of the Australia national rugby league team's jersey until the adoption of the green and gold. The Blues team is administered by the New South Wales Rugby League and the Maroons by the Queensland Rugby League. The New South Wales team are sometimes referred to by the nickname \\"Cockroaches\\" and the Queensland team as \\"Cane Toads\\", due to a marketing campaign used in the 1980s where the respective teams were caricatured as such.\\r\\nWhilst other Australian states also have representative rugby league teams, they have not competed in State of Origin.\\r\\nThe first calls for a state of origin selection policy in interstate rugby football came before the schism between the union and league codes eventuated in Australia. In 1900 a journalist known as 'The Cynic' wrote in The Referee that star rugby player and recent immigrant to Queensland, Stephen Spragg, should be able to play for his home state of New South Wales.[1]\\r\\nSince the beginning of Australian rugby league in 1908, an interstate competition between New South Wales and Queensland has been conducted from time to time. Until 1982 each team drew its players from the clubs based in that state. No consideration was given to the origins of the players themselves.[2]\\r\\nThe first of these interstate games was played at Sydney's Agricultural Ground on 11 July 1908, before Queensland had even commenced its club competition. New South Wales easily accounted for Queensland in a 43ÿ0 victory. The local media were unimpressed.\\r\\nThe interstate series was dominated by New South Wales, apart from a golden period for Queensland in the 1920s. From 1922 to 1925 Queensland defeated New South Wales 11 times in 12 matches. At the end of the 1925 season a Kangaroo team was to be picked for touring Great Britain. Instead of announcing an Australian team dominated by Queenslanders, the Australian Rugby League Board of Control informed the media that the Rugby Football League had decided that the Kiwis would provide stronger opposition, and that there would be no Australian tour.[4] The period spanning 1922 to 1929 saw no Australian team play in Great Britain, the only such hiatus outside the two World Wars.[5]\\r\\nThe New South Wales dominance of interstate football increased after 1956 when gaming machines were legalised for all registered clubs in New South Wales. This provided New South Wales football clubs with a revenue source unmatched by Queensland clubs. From this time on an increasing number of Queensland players moved to the much stronger Sydney competition, becoming ineligible for Queensland state selection. Paul Hogan famously told a Queensland Rugby League gathering in 1977 that \\"every time Queensland produces a good footballer, he finishes up being processed through a New South Wales poker machine.\\"[6]\\r\\nPrior to 1956, NSW had won 75% and Qld only 25% of series played. From 1956ÿ1981, NSW dominance soared even higher and Qld wins dwindled to only 3.8% with only 1 series win, in 1959.\\r\\nBy the 1970s the prestige of interstate matches had been seriously downgraded. Matches were played mid-week, so as not to interfere with the Sydney club competition, and the small crowds in New South Wales were hosted at suburban grounds.[12] Interstate football reached its nadir in 1977 when the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) declined to host the Queensland team, and both interstate games were played in Queensland.[7]\\r\\nFormer Queensland captain and Australian vice-captain Jack Reardon, who had later become a journalist, was the first to suggest that Sydney-based Queenslanders should be available for selection to represent their state.[13]\\r\\nBrisbane Courier-Mail reporter Hugh Lunn, Barry Maranta (the future co-founder of the Brisbane Broncos) [8] and Maranta's business partner Wayne Reid played a part in persuading QRL chairman Ron McAullife that the concept could be used in rugby league.[9] Lunn told McAullife that \\"you can take the Queenslander out of Queensland, Ron, but you can't take the Queensland out of the Queenslander.\\"[10] McAuliffe was initially sceptical. \\"What if we recall our boys from Sydney to play, and we are beaten. Where would we go from there?\\" Reid spoke to NSWRFL president Kevin Humphreys and suggested that a one-off state of origin match could be used as a Test Match selection trial. [11]\\r\\nNew South Wales clubs were reticent in their support of the concept and set two conditions:\\r\\nThree Sydney clubs remained opposed to the plan: St. George Dragons, South Sydney Rabbitohs and Eastern Suburbs Roosters. As these clubs were refusing to release players, Humphreys threatened to make the game an official Australian Rugby League trial, which would make release mandatory. The clubs backed down.[12]\\r\\nAfter Queensland lost the first two interstate matches in 1980 (35ÿ3 and 17ÿ7, the second game in front of only 1,638 Sydneysiders) it was announced that a 'state of origin' match would take place on 8 July at Lang Park in Brisbane. The New South Wales media gave both the event, and Queensland's chance of winning it, little credence, calling the game a \\"three day wonder\\". Australia's 1978 captain Bob Fulton called the match \\"the non-event of the century\\". Ron MacAullife however, was now committed to the concept and vigorously promoted the match. Thousands of tickets were sold before the game had been officially sanctioned. Although interstate matches in Brisbane had still been well attended (24,653 had attended the opening match of the 1979 series), few expected the sell-out crowd of 33,210 Queensland rugby league fans, delighted to see their heroes in the likes of Arthur Beetson representing their home state for the first time ever. Queensland convincingly beat New South Wales 20ÿ10.[13]\\r\\nI was strongly against such a match, but last night's gripping clash showed that such a fixture would be a welcome addition to the League program.[14]\\r\\nIn 1981 the first two interstate matches were again played under the old selection rules. As New South Wales won the first two matches in the series, state of origin selection rules were used once more in the third match. Although New South Wales ran out to an early 15ÿ0 lead in the game, Queensland rallied to win 22ÿ15.\\r\\nThe interest generated by the experimental state of origin matches of 1980 and 1981 and the potential for financial rewards were enough to convince the authorities to play all three games under state of origin rules the following year.[14]\\r\\nThe State of Origin format is the only possible way to allow the interstate series to survive.\\r\\nDespite the Maroons' success so far in the State of Origin experiments, the New South Wales media dismissed the seriousness of the Queensland threat to the Blues' long-held dominance in series wins. Queensland however, under the leadership of immortal captain Wally Lewis, was inspired by this, and for the first three State of Origin series Queensland won 2 matches to 1.\\r\\nHowever, in 1985, under the leadership of captain Steve Mortimer, New South Wales won the deciding match in front of 29,068 spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground, claiming the series for the first time. The following year the Blues were able to go one better and complete the first state of origin whitewash, taking the series 3ÿ0.[15]\\r\\nBarry Gomersall, from Sarina, Queensland (1945ÿ2007) was notorious for his refereeing of nine State of Origin matches between 1982 and 1988. Queensland rugby league team won seven of those matches, leading to accusations of bias and match-fixing. Gomersall himself did little to disassociate himself from those claims, famously referring to the only two matches under his control won by New South Wales rugby league team; \\"Surely anyone's entitled to two bad games\\". Queenslanders, on the other hand, were generally of the view that Sydney referees were no more to be relied on to give unbiased rulings in the games they controlled.[16]\\r\\nAfter Queensland had won the 1987 series 2ÿ1, a fourth game was played at Long Beach, California to showcase rugby league to the American public.[16]\\r\\nIn Origin: Rugby League's Greatest Contest 1980ÿ2002 (2003) Queensland writer Jack Gallaway tells a story:\\r\\nIn 1987 the Australian Rugby League (ARL), New South Wales Rugby League and Queensland Rugby League agreed that the match would only count towards the players' individual statistics. On 15 July 2003 the Australian Rugby League (whose primary members are originally from the New South Wales Rugby League) announced that the fourth 1987 game was to be classified as an official match, and that a win in the state of origin match on 16 July 2003 would take New South Wales into the overall lead.\\r\\nARL and NSWRL chief executive Geoff Carr said: \\"There had been some debate over whether the Origin fixture . . . in 1987 was counted as an official match but a search of ARL records has confirmed the status conferred on that clash by the game's governing body at the time. In announcing the match in Big League in April 1987, Ken Arthurson, the ARL's chief executive in 1987, was quoted as saying 'It's an exciting experiment but the match isn't and won't be billed as an exhibition match'.\\"\\r\\nAfter the controversy of the match played in the United States, the Queensland halves pairing of Allan Langer and Wally Lewis led the Maroons in their 3ÿ0 series wins in both 1988 and 1989. The rise of the Canberra Raiders in the then Winfield Cup club competition produced for the Blues the formidable halves combination of Ricky Stuart and Laurie Daley who brought New South Wales back from defeat with two wins in the opening games of the 1990 series. It was evident that as the rivalry between the two states grew, the Origin matches had become much more physical forward orientated game than the open running play seen in earlier series.[18]\\r\\nAs the great Queensland players from the 1980s began to retire from the game, the Maroons struggled with a team of fresh faces and considerable inexperience. The 1992, 1993 and 1994 series all went to NSW as the talent and experience of Blues players such as Brett Mullins, Daley and Stuart in the backs and Benny Elias and Bradley Clyde in the forwards gave the Blues the edge when the games were on the line. It wasn't until the upheaval of the Super League war in 1995 that the Maroons were able to again clinch a series.\\r\\nA main cause for concern for Queensland was the fact that the Brisbane Broncos, its players and many other Queenslanders were not aligned with the ARL prohibiting any players signed with the Super League to play for the Maroons. Despite this the Queenslanders won the 1995 series 3ÿ0 in a shocking white-wash. The 1996 series saw the off-field contract dramas put aside as all players were allowed, regardless of contract, state of origin selection. Having the majority of the Queenslanders back didn't help the Maroons though as the Blues 1996 white-wash with a 3ÿ0 series win of their own.\\r\\nThe Australian game divided in 1997 into two competitions, one run by the ARL and one by the News Limited-owned Super League, and an interstate series was played in each. Under the Super League banner there was a Tri-Origin series with a New Zealand side added to the competition. The ARL meanwhile stuck to its traditional format. The teams were selected using origin rules, and New South Wales and Queensland met twice. These matches do not count towards the official state of origin record. As with the premiership, players were spread between two representative tournaments as well.\\r\\nThe competitions merged again in 1998 as the current National Rugby League, and the series that year proved to be enthralling as both sides won a game each away from home, setting up a decider at the Sydney Football Stadium where 39,000 fans witnessed the visiting Queenslanders take the series 2ÿ1. The end of the decade saw a dramatic series with each side taking one game each and game three ending in a draw. Queensland were awarded the series as at the time the previous winners retained the interstate honours.\\r\\nThe early to mid-2000s saw New South Wales starting to assert its traditional interstate dominance, causing some commentators [who?] to question State of Origin' future. However, this imbalance tipped in the third and deciding game of the 2006 State of Origin series, which is seen as the starting point of Queensland's unprecedented dynasty. The 2008 series was won by Queensland making it three series in a row. New South Wales won Game 1 on 21 May 2008, however Queensland won Game 2 on 11 June 2008, and also Game 3 on 2 July 2008. Queensland followed this up by winning the first two games of the 2009 series becoming the first state to win four series in a row.\\r\\nQueensland won its historic, record breaking, fifth consecutive Origin series with a 23ÿ18 win in the third and final match of the State of Origin, 2010. This was the first Queensland team to win all three consecutive State of Origin Games in 15 years. Queensland full back Billy Slater won man of the match in the third game and was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as Man of the Series in 2010.\\r\\nThe 2010 State of Origin series was also the second televised program in Australia to be shot in 3D 1080i DVB-T as well as being simultaneously broadcast in regular 576i and 1080i DVB-T and PAL.\\r\\nIn the first game of the 2011 series Queensland defeated New South Wales 16ÿ12. In the second game of the 2011 series New South Wales defeated Queensland 18ÿ8. Queensland won the series 34ÿ24 in the 2011 decider in what was Queensland captain Darren Lockyer's 36th and final game. Cameron Smith won man of the match in both the first and third game and was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal as Man of the Series.\\r\\nIn 2012, then NRL CEO David Gallop introduced the Under-20s State of Origin for Toyota Cup players which saw New South Wales winning. Queensland went on to win an historic 7th series win in 2012, winning the final game by 1 point.\\r\\nIn 2013, New South Wales defeated Queensland 14 to 6 in game 1, Queensland defeated New South Wales 26 to 6 in game 2, while in game 3 Queensland defeated New South Wales 12 to 10 to take out the overall Origin title for the eighth consecutive time. The 2013 series set a new State of Origin television ratings record for a whole series since the 2001 introduction of the ratings system.[17]\\r\\nIn 2014, New South Wales defeated Queensland 12-8 in the first game of the series, and 6-4 in the second.[18] In the third game Queensland defeated New South Wales 32-8 after scoring the first try of the game in the 37th minute, with Queensland leading 6-2 in the first half. This gave the Blues the first series win in 8 years.\\r\\nIn 2015, Queensland defeated New South Wales 11-10 in game 1 played in Sydney, New South Wales defeated Queensland 26-18 in game 2 played in Melbourne, Queensland defeated New South Wales 52-6 in game 3 played in Brisbane, winning the series 2-1.\\r\\nIn 2016, Queensland defeated New South Wales 6-4 in game 1 and clinched the series with a 26-16 win in the second match. New South Wales closed off the series with a 18-14 win over Queensland.\\r\\nIn 2017, New South Wales won Game 1, 28-4 sparking the New South Wales media to start proclaiming the beginning of the Blues Dynasty. Queensland won Game 2, 18-16 after making changes to the team with the returning Billy Slater and Johnathan Thurston, who kicked the winning goal for Queensland. Thurston injured his shoulder in the 30th minute of the match, essentially disabling it as he played out the whole match. Thurston was later ruled out for the rest of the year after scans revealed his shoulder needed a reconstruction, ending his representative career as he announced 2017 would be his last representative year. In Game 3, New South Wales went in with an unchanged lineup for all three games, the first to do so since 1996. Queensland dominated the Blues, winning 22-6, with Queensland Winger Dane Gagai winning the Wally Lewis Medal for Best Player in the series. It also had Johnathan Thurston raise the Origin Shield with Queensland Captain Cameron Smith, before being chaired off the ground by his teammates, ending Thurston's representative career on a high note.\\r\\nIn 2013, each individual game in the series drew a higher Australian television audience than any other sporting event.[19] In recent years the series has gained popularity outside of New South Wales and Queensland, with games played in Melbourne drawing record crowds[20] and local television ratings comparable to those of many Victorian AFL matches.[21] Internationally, the series is televised in 91 countries,[22] and is a national obsession in Papua New Guinea, occasionally sparking riots, violence and deaths.[23][24] It also draws a strong following in neighbouring New Zealand.[25]\\r\\nWithin Australia, Nine Network is the main broadcaster for the series, with replays airing on Fox Sports. The series is also broadcast on radio by ABC Grandstand.\\r\\nSetanta Sports broadcasts live matches in Asia. In the United States, Fox Soccer televised all matches live using the Nine feed since 2011, with the coverage moving to Fox Sports 2 when Fox Soccer was discontinued in August 2013.[26][27] Premier Sports broadcasts live coverage of State of Origin in the UK.\\r\\nAnother twist on the coverage was Roy and HG's State of Origin commentary on Australian youth radio network Triple J. This broadcast was presented by the characters \\"Rampaging\\" Roy Slaven and HG Nelson (played by John Doyle and Greig Pickhaver), who commentated the game with a unique comedic style. Roy and HG's broadcasts began in the late 1980s, and continued until 2008. Roy and HG moved from Triple J to radio network Triple M in 2009, at which point the duo ceased their State of Origin commentary.\\r\\nUnder State of Origin rules players were previously selected for the state in which they first played senior (or registered) rugby league.[19] In 2012, the NSWRL, CRL, QRL and ARLC agreed on new criteria in determining Origin eligibility, to encompass other factors, such as place of birth [20]. Players must also be eligible to represent Australia at international level.\\r\\nFrom time to time the selection of players under the State of Origin rules creates controversy. Since 1980, Queensland has completed just the 7 series with a team completely made up of players of a Queensland birth, while for New South Wales the total is only 6.[28] However, place of birth has only been a relevant factor in eligibility since 2012.\\r\\nAn issue of contention has been the selection of players such as Peter Sterling, Ken Nagas, James McManus, Israel Folau and Greg Inglis. Folau was born and raised in New South Wales but is eligible to play for Queensland as he played his first senior rugby league match in Queensland. Ken Nagas was born and raised in Queensland but decided to play for New South Wales, Peter Sterling was born in Toowoomba, Queensland and raised in Wagga Wagga, Newcastle & Sydney, all in New South Wales, while McManus was born in Scotland and was raised in the Northern Territory, but was ruled eligible to play for New South Wales in the 2009 series.\\r\\nThe selection of Greg Inglis by Queensland was disputed. The Queensland Rugby League selected him based on the fact that either Wavell State High School or Brisbane Norths was Inglis' first senior football, making him eligible for both states per the rules at the time.[29][30][31] However Inglis had previously played for Hunter Sports High School in Newcastle, New South Wales, in the Arrive Alive Cup; considered to be a senior competition. Hunter Sports High coach Steve Dunn said \\"there was some talk the other day that he was actually brought to Queensland before his 16th birthday but I was coach of the team. He played for us at 16, he's a Blue\\".[32] The controversy led to the creation of the \\"That's In Queensland\\" viral video.\\r\\nDue to the clarification of selection rules the Sims brothers are eligible for different States. Tariq and Ashton are eligible for New South Wales while Korbin Sims is eligible for Queensland.[33] Previously father and son combinations, such as Steve and Mat Rogers have represented different states. This duo was especially notable because Mat was born in New South Wales and played for Queensland while Steve was born in Queensland and played for New South Wales. Steve Rogers played his first senior game of rugby League for the Southport Tigers on Queenslands Gold Coast\\r\\nForeign born players have also represented each state. New Zealand has had several players, such as Brad Thorn, Ben Te'o, Craig Smith, Willie Mason, Tonie Carroll, James Tamou and Karmichael Hunt play Origin. Tamou's selection by New South Wales in 2012 was controversial as he was born in Palmerston North and played for the Junior Kiwis, lived in New Zealand until he moved to Sydney when he was 13 and was included in the New Zealand Kiwis training squad for the 2011 Four Nations.[34] Both Hunt and Tamou played for Australia before being selected for State of Origin. Other players, such as Sam Kasiano and Jason Taumalolo are also eligible, creating concern in the New Zealand Rugby League.[35] Apart from representing Queensland, Brad Thorn is also a dual rugby international, having played international rugby league for Australia, and international rugby union for the All Blacks.\\r\\nPapua New Guinea-born Adrian Lam and Fijian-born Lote Tuqiri, Akuila Uate and Petero Civoniceva have also played Origin. Benny Elias was born in Lebanon and has played for and captained NSW. Mario Fenech was born in Malta and has played for NSW. The most recent case of a foreign born player being selected was the selection of former Samoan international, Ben Te'o, by Queensland in game three of the 2012 season.[36]\\r\\nA report into eligibility based on a player's birth state showed; \\"Of the 18 series that QLD has won, it had the greater percentage of non-State [born] players in its side on 14 of those occasions ÿ revealing a 77.8% dependency. Of the 13 series that NSW has won, on five of those occasions it had the higher percentage of non-State [born] players across the series ÿ revealing a 38.5% dependency.\\"[28]\\r\\nOf the 36 full series played, Queensland have won 21, New South Wales 13, with 2 series drawn (Queensland retained the Shield on both occasions as the previous year's winner). With the addition of three one-off games that were played in 1980, 1981 and 1987, the total number of games played is 108. Queensland have won 58, New South Wales have won 48, with 2 matches being drawn.[37]\\r\\nThe series of 1999 and 2002 are considered drawn series, as both New South Wales and Queensland won a single game of each 3 match series, with the final game concluding in a draw. At that time there was no overtime rule to break the deadlock, and by the same set of rules, Queensland retained the shield as they were the previous holders, but did not win the series. Due to controversy around the second drawn series, and the rule awarding the series champions to Queensland, the rules were subsequently changed to rule out drawn matches and series. Equal points at the close of full-time are now resolved with the golden point method.\\r\\nFrom 1992 to 2003 the Wally Lewis Medal was awarded by the Queensland Rugby League for the Queensland player of the series. Since 2003 it has been awarded to the player of the series, irrespective of state. The following players have been awarded the Wally Lewis Medal for player of the series1. Cameron Smith has won the medal a record four times.\\r\\n1The award was originally a Queensland only award from Lewis' retirement in 1992 until 2003, where the best player of the series could win the award, regardless of their state. The Ron McAuliffe Medal replaced the Wally Lewis Medal as the Queensland exclusive award.\\r\\nThese records that are about to be shown are mainly about the stadium's and players of the game.

New South Wales has won all of them. They play for the Darren Lockyer Shield.\\r\\nThe Women's State of Origin is the Women's rugby league version of the game, and has been running since 1999. The players play for the Nellie Doherty Cup. Furthermore, the current record for series won in the competition rests with Queensland, who won every series from 1999-2014, a better straight record than their male counterparts.\\r\\nQueensland: 1808 Points\\r\\nNew South Wales: 1656 Points","input":"Where was the first state of origin held?"},{"output":"flattened band of tissue that connects both parts of the thalamus at their medial surfaces","context":"The interthalamic adhesion (also known as the massa intermedia or middle commissure) is a flattened band of tissue that connects both parts of the thalamus at their medial surfaces.

Polygyny is the specific practice of one man taking more than one wife: it is a common marriage pattern in some parts of the world. In North America polygamy has not been a culturally normative or legally recognized institution since the continent's colonization by Europeans.\\r\\nPolygamy became a significant social and political issue in the United States in 1852, when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) made it known that a form of the practice, called plural marriage, was part of its doctrine. Opposition to the practice by the United States government resulted in an intense legal conflict, and culminated in LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff announcing the church's official abandonment of the practice on September 25, 1890.[1] However, breakaway Mormon fundamentalist groups living mostly in the western United States, Canada, and Mexico still practice plural marriage.\\r\\nSome other Americans practice polygamy including some American Muslims.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPolygamy is defined as the practice or condition of having more than one spouse at the same time, conventionally referring to a situation where all spouses know about each other, in contrast to bigamy, where two or more spouses are usually unaware of each other.[3]\\r\\nPolygamy is the act or condition of a person marrying another person while still being lawfully married to another spouse. As this is the very definition of bigamy, it is illegal in the United States. The crime is punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both, according to the law of the individual state and the circumstances of the offense.[4] As of 2008, there were no longer any federal laws against polygamy[5] (Edmunds Act having been repealed in 1983), but there are laws against the practice in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam,[6] and Puerto Rico.[7] At the federal level, the practice is considered \\"against public policy\\" and, accordingly, the U.S. government won't recognize bigamous marriages for immigration purposes (that is, would not allow one of the spouses to petition for immigration benefits for the other), even if they are legal in the country where bigamous marriage was celebrated.[8] Any immigrant who is coming to the United States to practice polygamy is inadmissible.[9]\\r\\nMany US courts (e.g. Turner v. S., 212 Miss. 590, 55 So.2d 228) treat bigamy as a strict liability crime: in some jurisdictions, a person can be convicted of a felony even if he reasonably believed he had only one legal spouse. For example, if a person has the mistaken belief that their previous spouse is dead or that their divorce is final, they can still be convicted of bigamy if they marry a new person.[10]\\r\\nIn Canada the federal Criminal Code applies throughout the country. It extends the normal definition of polygamy to having any kind of conjugal union with more than one person at the same time. Also anyone who assists, celebrates, or is a part to a rite, ceremony, or contract that sanctions a polygamist relationship is guilty of polygamy. Polygamy is an offence punishable by up to five years in prison.\\r\\nScots-Irish settlers, and some Welsh emigrants, carried long-standing multiple partner traditions to the Americas from Europe.[11][page?needed] Utopian and communal groups established during the mid-19th century had varying marriage systems, including group marriage and polygyny.[12] There is also some evidence in the American South for multiple marriage partners, particularly after the Civil War.[11][page?needed]\\r\\nPolygamy has also been practiced, discreetly, by some Muslims living in America.[2] However, these polygamous marriages are not recognized by American law.\\r\\nBecause polygamy has been illegal throughout the United States since the mid-19th century, and in many individual states before that, sources on alternative marriage practices are limited. Consequently, it is difficult to get a clear picture of the extent of the practice in the past and at the present time.\\r\\n Latter Day Saints portal\\r\\nMormon practice of plural marriage was officially introduced by Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, on July 12, 1843. As polygamy was illegal in the state of Illinois,[13] it was practiced secretly during Smith's lifetime. During the 1839ÿ44 Nauvoo era, several Mormon leaders (including Smith, Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball) took plural wives, any Mormon leaders that publicly taught polygamous doctrine were disciplined. For example, Hyram Brown was excommunicated on February 1, 1844.[14] In May 1844 Smith declared, \\"What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing adultery, and having seven wives, when I can only find one.\\"[15]\\r\\nAfter the death of Joseph Smith, the practice of polygamy continued with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), then led by Brigham Young. In the territory that became Utah, and some surrounding areas, plural marriage was openly practiced by LDS Church adherents. In 1852, Young felt the LDS Church in Utah was secure enough to publicly announce their practice of polygamy. However opposition from the U.S. government threatened the legal standing of the LDS Church. President Wilford Woodruff announced the LDS Church's official abandonment of the practice on September 25, 1890. Woodruff's declaration was formally accepted in an LDS Church general conference on October 6, 1890. The LDS Church's position on the practice of polygamy was reinforced by another formal statement in 1904 called the Second Manifesto, which again renounced polygamy.[16]\\r\\nAlthough the Second Manifesto ended the official practice of new plural marriages, existing plural marriages were not automatically dissolved. Many Mormons, including prominent LDS Church leaders, maintained existing plural marriages well into the 20th century. A small percentage of adherents rejected the change, identifying as Mormon fundamentalists and leaving the mainstream LDS Church to continue practicing plural marriage.\\r\\nSome sects that practice or at least sanction polygamy are the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS), the Latter-day Church of Christ and the Apostolic United Brethren. Polygamy among these groups persists today in Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Canada, and some neighboring states, as well as up to 15,000 isolated individuals with no organized church affiliation.[17] Polygamist churches of Latter Day Saint origin are often referred to as \\"Mormon fundamentalist\\"; however, the main LDS Church has rejected polygamy since the early 20th century. Mormon fundamentalists often use an ambiguous September 27, 1886 revelation to John Taylor as the basis for continuing the practice of plural marriage.[18][unreliable source?]\\r\\nThe Salt Lake Tribune estimates there may be as many as 37,000 Mormon fundamentalists, with less than half living in polygamous households.[19] Most polygamous groups are composed of about a dozen extended Mormon fundamentalist organizations.[20][21][22][23] The LDS Church asserts it is improper to call any of these splinter polygamous groups \\"Mormon.\\"[24][25]\\r\\nMembers of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) practice polygamy in arranged marriages that often, but not always, place young girls with older men. Most FLDS members live in Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona, about 350 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, with other communities in Canada, Texas and other areas of the North American west. The FLDS leader is currently Warren Jeffs.[26]\\r\\nIn 1998, about 40,000 people living in Utah were part of a polygamist family, or about 1.4 percent of the population.[27] Polygamists have been difficult to prosecute because many only seek marriage licenses for their first marriage, while the other marriages are secretly conducted in private ceremonies. Thereafter, secondary wives attempt to be seen in public as single women with children.[27]\\r\\nSome polygamous families use a system of multiple divorce and legal marriage as a loophole in order to avoid committing a criminal act. In such cases the husband marries the first wife, she takes his last name, he divorces her and then marries the next wife, who takes his name. This is repeated until he has married and divorced all his wives, except possibly the last one. This way the wives feel justified in calling themselves Mrs [husband's last name] and, while legally they are divorced from the husband, they still act as if married to him and expect those around them to acknowledge and respect this.\\r\\nSince only one wife is officially married to the husband at any one time, no law is being broken and so this type of polygamous family unit can be overt about their relationship. The conviction of Thomas Arthur Green in 2001 may have made the legal status of such relationships more precarious in Utah, although Green's bigamy convictions were made possible only by his own public statements.\\r\\nMormon fundamentalist sects tend to aggregate in individual communities of their own specific sect and basis for polygamy. These small groups range from a few hundred up to 10,000, and are located across Western North America,[28] including:\\r\\nThe practice of informal polygamy among fundamentalist groups presents interesting legal issues. It has been considered difficult to prosecute polygamists for bigamy, in large part because they are rarely formally married under state laws. Without evidence that suspected offenders have multiple formal or common-law marriages, these groups are merely subject to the laws against adultery or unlawful cohabitation  laws which are not commonly enforced because they also criminalize other behavior that is otherwise socially sanctioned. However, some \\"Fundamentalist\\" polygamists marry women prior to the age of consent, or commit fraud to obtain welfare and other public assistance.\\r\\nIn 1953, the state of Arizona investigated and raided a group of 385 people in the polygamist-practicing colony of Hildale and Colorado City, straddling the Utah-Arizona border. All the men were arrested and the children were placed with foster families. A judge eventually ruled this action illegal, and everyone returned to the community, which now contains about 10,000 people.[30]\\r\\nIn 2001, in the state of Utah in the United States, Juab County Attorney David O. Leavitt successfully prosecuted Thomas Green, who was convicted of criminal non-support and four counts of bigamy for having five serially monogamous marriages, while living with previous legally divorced wives. His cohabitation was considered evidence of a common-law marriage to the wives he had divorced while still living with them. That premise was subsequently affirmed by the Utah Supreme Court in State v. Green, as applicable only in the State of Utah. Green was also convicted of child rape and criminal non-support.[31]\\r\\nIn 2005, the state attorneys-general of Utah and Arizona issued a primer on helping victims of domestic violence and child abuse in polygamous communities.[32] It was subsequently updated four times, the latest in 2011.[28][33][29][34] Enforcement of crimes such as child abuse, domestic violence, and fraud were emphasized over the enforcement of anti-polygamy and bigamy laws. The priorities of local prosecutors are not covered by this statement.\\r\\nIn 2008, starting on April 4, Texas State officials took 436 women and children into temporary legal custody after Rozita Swinton, a 33-year-old woman living in Colorado Springs, Colorado, called both Texas Social Services and a local shelter claiming to be a 16-year-old girl. She made a series of phone calls to authorities in late March, claiming she had been beaten and forced to become a \\"spiritual\\" wife to an adult man. Acting on her calls, authorities raided the ranch in Eldorado, about 40 miles south of San Angelo. The YFZ Ranch is owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS), a Mormon offshoot that practices polygamy. Two men were arrested for obstructing the raid but were later released. Several men were found guilty and convicted of sexual assault, rape, and bigamy involving underage girls.[35][36][37]\\r\\nThe stars of the TLC show Sister Wives challenged the state of Utah's bigamy laws,[38] though also acknowledging that the state's constitutional ban of plural marriage licenses would remain regardless of the lawsuit's outcome.[38] On December 13, 2013, US Federal Judge Clark Waddoups ruled in Brown v. Buhman[39] that the portions of Utah's anti-polygamy laws which prohibit multiple cohabitation were unconstitutional, but also allowed Utah to maintain its ban on multiple marriage licenses.[40][41][42] Unlawful cohabitation, where prosecutors did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), had been a major tool used to prosecute polygamy in Utah since the 1882 Edmunds Act.[43] The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed sister wives decision in April 11 2016 [44] On January 23 2017, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear arguments from the husband and four wives who star in the television show \\"Sister Wives,\\" letting stand a lower court ruling that kept polygamy a crime in Utah. [45]\\r\\nIn Canada, polygamy is a criminal offence under section 293 of the Criminal Code, which provides for a penalty of up to five years imprisonment,[46] but prosecutions are rare. As of January 2009, no person has been prosecuted for polygamy in Canada in over sixty years.[47] However, Edith Barlow, a mother of five in the polygamous community of Bountiful, B.C., was denied permanent residence and was asked to leave the country after ten years in Canada.[48]\\r\\nA 2005 report by the Alberta Civil Liberties Research Centre recommended that Canada decriminalize polygamy, stating: \\"Criminalization is not the most effective way of dealing with gender inequality in polygamous and plural union relationships. Furthermore, it may violate the constitutional rights of the parties involved.\\"[49] In 2007, the Attorney General of British Columbia expressed concerns over whether this prohibition is constitutional, and an independent prosecutor in British Columbia recommended that Canadian courts be asked to rule on the constitutionality of laws against polygamy.[50] The Supreme Court of British Columbia upheld Canada's anti-polygamy section 293 of the Criminal Code and other ancillary legislation in a 2011 reference case.[51][52]","input":"When did polygamy become illegal in the us?"},{"output":"Alex Bregman of the Houston Astros","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award is an annual Major League Baseball (MLB) award which is presented to the most outstanding player in each year's MLB All-Star Game.

At that time Sikkm had already solidified into country then with a king known as a Chogyal or dharma king and till 16 may 1975 was an independent country ruled by the monarchs. Sikkim had twelve kings Palden Thondup Namgyal was the last king of Independent Sikkim.There was contacts between ancient Hindus and Tibetans, followed by the establishment of a Buddhist kingdom or Chogyal in the 17th century. Sikkim emerged as a polity in its own right against a backdrop of incursions from Tibet and Bhutan, during which the kingdom enjoyed varying degrees of independence. In the early 18th century, the British Empire sought to establish trade routes with Tibet, leading Sikkim to fall under British suzerainty until independence in 1947. Initially, Sikkim remained an independent country, until it merged with India in 1975 after a decisive referendum. Many provisions of the Indian constitution had to be altered to accommodate the international treaties between Sikkim and India.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Kirat King Yalambar captured central Nepal in 1,500 B.C his kingdom extended from river Trisuli in the west to river Teesta in the east.[1][2] According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva is said to have appeared in the form of hunter Kirateshwar or Lord of the Kiratas to Arjuna in the very spot where the ancient Kirateshwar temple lies in Legship, West Sikkim.[3][4] By the 6th century the Lepchas occupied the Lapchan area of Nepal (present Ilam region), present Sikkim, Har Chu Valley and Ammo Chu Valley (present South Western Bhutan) and most of Eastern part of Greater Sikkim up to the Chumbi Valley. Meanwhile, the Limbus inhabited the Western part of Greater Sikkim (present Limbuwan region).[5] A part of Limbuwan is still retained in present Sikkim in the West district, South district and a part of North district.[6] The Lepchas spoke the Lepcha dialect and were believers of Boongthism and Munism or Animism by faith. The Limbus spoke the Limbu dialect and were believers of Yumaism or Yuma Sammang, a form of Kirat Mundhum.[5]\\r\\nIn the 7th century, Thekung Adek consolidated the Lepcha tribes and declared himself a Panu, a Tribal Religious and Administrative chief or king. Similarly, the Limbu tribes were ruled by 10 elected chiefs or Hangs from each of their clans to form a social and administrative body called Thibong Yakthum Tumyanghang (tribal republic council or Ten Limbus Council).[7] Around 870 A.D. Na Hang, the chief of Daramdin, West Sikkim was incited by the Chilikchom people to fight against the Kirati Limbu king of Limbuwan, Mabo Hang. Na Hang was defeated and the Chilikchom were banished from Limbuwan.[8] Sikkim also finds mention in many Hindu texts because the Buddhist saint Guru Rinpoche or Padmasambhava is said to have passed through the land in the 9th century. According to legend, the Guru blessed the land, introduced Buddhism to Sikkim and also foretold the era of the monarchy in the state, which would arrive centuries later. There are numerous stories regarding the migration of Tibetans into Sikkim and the establishment of the Sikkimese monarchy. The most popular states that in the 13th century, Guru Tashi, a prince from the Minyak House in Kham in Eastern Tibet, had a divine revelation one night instructing him to travel south to seek his fortunes. Guru Tashi settled down in the Chumbi Valley.[9][10] The population and linguistic survey were not held during this period but it's certain that the region was inhabited by the Lepchas, the Limbus, the Magars and some Bhutias in the later periods.[11]\\r\\nBy 1641 the Lepchas, the Limbus and the Magars were ruling in different villages independently.[12] The Limbu and the Magar tribes lived in the remote Western and Southern regions.[13] In the early 17th century the Bhutias were forced to take refuge in Sikkim due to the conflict between followers of the Yellow hat and the Red hats in Tibet. The Bhutias tried to convert the Sikkimese worshippers of nature to Buddhism and succeeded to an extent.[14] The Tibetan Lamas sought to establish Sikkim as a Buddhist Kingdom thereby electing a Lhopa King of Tibetan origin.[12]\\r\\nIn 1642, the fifth generation descendant of Guru Tashi, Phuntsog Namgyal was consecrated as the first Denjong Gyalpo or the Chogyal (king) of Sikkim by Lhatsun Chhenpo, Nga-dag Lama and Kathhog Lama, three great Lamas who came from the north, west and south to Yuksom Norbugang in West Sikkim.[15] The event, Naljor Chezhi, was as predicted by Guru Rinpoche some eight hundred years before. The Dalai Lama sent the new Chogyal a silk scarf, the mitre of Guru Rinpoche and a sand image of him as a coronation present.[15] However the Limbu and the Magar chiefs refused to accept the rule of the Chogyal who had to bring in Tibetan soldiers to subdue them.[12][16]\\r\\nThis historical gathering of the three virtuous lamas is called Yuksom, which in Lepcha means 'The Place where the Three monks met' as in Lepcha a lama is called a \\"Yukmun\\" and the word for three is \\"Som\\". The Chogyal, along with the three lamas proselytised the Lepcha tribes into Buddhism and annexed the Chumbi Valley, the present-day Darjeeling district and parts of today's eastern Nepal.\\r\\nShortly after his coronation the new Chogyal appointed 12 kalons or ministers from the Bhutia community and split his kingdom into 12 Dzongs or administrative units, which each contained a fort. Individual Dzongs were headed by a Dzonga drawn from amongst the Lepchas. The lands of Sikkim were leased as gifts to kazis and thikadars who in turn leased sub-plots to peasants at high rents. Mandals (headmen) and karbaris (assistants to the mandals) were employed by the kazis and thikadars as rent collectors and dispute mediators. Out of Sikkims 104 revenue estates, 61 were leased to kazis and thikadars for fixed sums, five were given to monasteries and fifteen retained by the Chogyal for his private use.[17][18] The Limbu chiefs or the Subbas were also given full autonomy of their districts under the King.[12]\\r\\nThus Phuntsog Namgyal became the first King of the Kingdom of Sikkim and all the Kirat chiefs agreed to regard him as the supreme ruler. However the Magars did not get along with the Bhutias and left Sikkim after they were defeated in a battle. The King called all the Kirat chiefs and proclaimed that Bhutias or Lhopsas, Tsongs or the Limbus and the Mempas or the Lepchas were all part of one family known as the Lho-Mehn-Tsong with the King as the father, the Lepchas as the mother and the Limbus as the sons and they were forbidden to fight amongst themselves.[12] The signing of this tripartite treaty of Lho-Mehn-Tsong Tsum was overseen by eight Bhutia tribal leaders, twelve Limbu tribal leaders and four Lepcha tribal leaders in present West Sikkim.[11]\\r\\nPhuntsog Namgyal was succeeded by his son, Tensung Namgyal in 1670. The reign of this Chogyal was peaceful and saw the capital move from Yuksom to Rabdentse. Chakdor Namgyal, the king's second wife's son, took over the throne from him in 1700. This outraged his elder half-sister Pendiongmu, who ousted him with the help of the Bhutanese. From 1700 to 1706, when Chakdor Namgyal, the third Chogyal of the Kingdom of Sikkim, most parts of it were invaded by Deb Naku Zidar, the king of Bhutan. Chakdor Namgyal went into exile in Tibet. The Tibetan people subsequently expelled the Bhutanese army, and called Chakdor Namgyal back to Sikkim.[19] Chakdor's son Gyurmed Namgyal succeeded him in 1717. Gyurmed's reign saw many skirmishes between the Nepalese and Sikkimese. Phuntsog Namgyal II, the illegitimate child of Gyurmed, succeeded his father in 1733. His reign was tumultuous in the face of attacks by the Bhutanese and the Nepalese who managed to capture the capital Rabdentse.\\r\\nTenzing Namgyal, Chogyal from 1780 to 1793, was a weak ruler, and his sovereignty saw most of Sikkim being appropriated by Nepal. In 1788, the Nepali Gorkha Army invaded Sikkim, and took Limbuana and the former capital Rabdentse by storm. The king of Sikkim went into exile in Tibet for a second time. In 1788, the 8th Dalai Lama stationed him in Chumbi Valley in Rn zong (also \\"Rr,\\" today's Yadong County).[19][20] His son Tshudpud Namgyal, returned to Sikkim in 1793 to reclaim the throne with the help of China. Finding Rabdentse too close to the Nepalese border, he shifted the capital to Tumlong.\\r\\nWith the arrival of the British in neighbouring India, Sikkim allied itself with them as they had a common enemy ÿ the Gorkha Kingdom of Nepal. The infuriated Nepalese attacked Sikkim with vengeance, over-running most of the region including the Terai. This prompted the British East India Company to attack Nepal resulting in the Anglo-Nepalese War, which began in 1814. Treaties signed between British and Nepal ÿ the Sugauli Treaty and Sikkim and British India ÿ Treaty of Titalia, returned the territory annexed by the Nepalese to Sikkim in 1817.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the British were looking for a route to establish trading links with Tibet. An offshoot of the ancient Silk Road through Sikkim meant that the kingdom was ideal as a transit route. A secondary reason for the establishment of links was to quell the growing Russian influence in Tibet in the context of The Great Game. However ties between Sikkim and India grew sour with the taxation of the area of Morang by the British. An internal disturbance, which began in 1825, gave the British the opportunity to secure the 1835 cession of Darjeeling to British Sikkim in view of its perceived advantages as a sanitorium. Unhappy with this development, Sikkim's Dewan often frustrated the cessation by denying aid to the British in capturing escaped criminals and offering amnesty for escaped slaves. As compensation for the loss, the British Government paid the Sikkim Raja Rs. 3,000 from 1841 onwards, a sum that was later increased to Rs. 12,000.[21]\\r\\nIn 1849, British doctor Archibald Campbell, then superintendent of Darjeeling, and botanist Joseph Hooker, ventured into the mountains of Sikkim with the permission of the British and the Chogyal of Sikkim but strayed across the Cho La into Tibet. They were detained by the Sikkim government at the instigation of the pro-Tibetan \\"mad Dewan\\" T. Namguey, which led to a punitive British expedition against the Himalayan kingdom.[22][21] Although subsequent bloodshed was avoided, the British annexed the whole of Darjeeling district and the Terai in 1861. In the same year, signature of the Treaty of Tumlong effectively made Sikkim a de facto protectorate of the British.[23]\\r\\nAlongside \\"British Sikkim\\", \\"Independent Sikkim\\" continued to exist as a rump state centred around the capital at Gangtok ruling over 2,500 square miles (6,500?km2) of territory.[24] The former Chogyal was forced to abdicate in favour of his son, Sidkeong Namgyal in 1863.\\r\\nThe Chogyals endeavored to modernize Sikkim in the succeeding decades, along with their army. A state visit to Darjeeling by Sidekong's half brother, Chogyal Thutob Namgyal in 1873 failed to yield such results, and he returned to Tumlong disappointed. In 1886, the British, interested in trade with Tibet, launched a brief expedition into Sikkim. The Tibetans occupied several of Sikkim's northern border forts, and the Chogyal and his wife were held prisoner by the British when they came to negotiate at Calcutta. In 1888, the Tibetans were defeated and northern Sikkim came under the rule of British India. The British established new landholdings in Sikkim, but released the Chogyal only to have him captured again in 1891. In 1894, the capital was shifted to Gangtok.\\r\\nIn 1895, the Chogyal was released, but the British governors in India reneged on an agreement ÿ the Ten Clauses Agreement ÿ which returned sovereignty to Sikkim. The Political Officer in Sikkim, John Claude White, refused to return any sovereignty, and only let the Chogyal retain the judiciary of Sikkim.\\r\\nIn 1905, the Prince of Wales ÿ the future King George V ÿ arrived in Calcutta on a state visit during which he met the Chogyal. The two made an excellent acquaintance and the Crown Prince of Sikkim, Sidkeong Tulku was sent to study at Oxford University. When Sidkeong came to power, he arranged widened sovereignty for Sikkim from King George's government and endorsed sweeping reforms in his short rule as Chogyal, which ended in 1914. In 1918, Sikkim's independence in all domestic affairs was restored, and in the next decade the kingdom embarked on a policy to end social ills, outlawing gambling, child labour, and indentured service.\\r\\nSikkim had retained guarantees of independence from Britain when it became independent, and such guarantees were transferred to the Indian government when it gained independence in 1947. A popular vote for Sikkim to join the Indian Union failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim was to be a tributary of India, in which India controlled its external defence, diplomacy and communication. A state council was established in 1953 to allow for constitutional government for the Chogyal, which was sustained until 1973.\\r\\nIn 1962, India and the People's Republic of China went to war. Although Sikkim was an independent country, skirmishes occurred at the Nathula Pass between Indian border guards and the Chinese soldiers. After the war, the ancient pass was shut down (it reopened 6 July 2006).\\r\\nThe old ruler Tashi Namgyal died in 1963 after suffering from cancer. The last hereditary ruler, the Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal, ascended to the throne in 1965. Trouble began to brew for the crown even before the Chogyal assumed the throne, as Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's status as an independent protectorate, died in 1964. His daughter Indira Gandhi, who became Prime Minister in 1966, would have little patience for maintaining an independent Sikkim or its monarchy. The chogyal, who responded to the increased pressure by drinking, was viewed by India as politically dangerous, especially after his wife, the American socialite Hope Cooke, published a journal article advocating a return of certain former Sikkimese properties.\\r\\nIn early 1970 the anti-monarchy Sikkim National Congress Party demanded fresh elections and greater representation for the Nepalese.\\r\\nIn 1973, anti-royalty riots in front of the palace led to a formal request for protection from India. India worried that an unstable Sikkim would invite China to act on its claims that Sikkim was part of Tibet, and therefore part of China. The Indian government appointed a Chief administrator, Mr. B. S. Das, who effectively wrested control of the country away from the Chogyal.\\r\\nFrosty relations between the Chogyal and the elected Kazi (Prime Minister) Lhendup Dorji resulted in an attempt to block the meeting of the legislature. The Kazi was elected by the Council of Ministers which was unanimous in its opposition to the retention of the Monarchy.\\r\\nPrime Minister Dorji appealed to the Indian Parliament for representation and change of status to statehood. On 14 April 1975, a referendum was held, in which Sikkim voted to merge with the union of India. Sikkim became the 22nd Indian State on 26 April 1975. On 16 May 1975, Sikkim officially became a state of the Indian Union and Lhendup Dorji became head of State (chief minister).\\r\\nThe position of Chogyal was thus abolished, ending the monarchy. In 1982, Palden Thondup died of cancer in the United States.\\r\\nThe 1979 assembly election saw Nar Bahadur Bhandari elected Chief Minister of Sikkim. Bhandhari held on to win again in 1984 and 1989. In 1994, Assembly politician Pawan Kumar Chamling became the Chief Minister of Sikkim. In 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014 Chamling consolidated his position to sweep the polls.\\r\\nSino-Indian relations were somewhat bruised in 2000 by an event in Sikkim which challenged China's longstanding claim of Sikkim as an independent country. The unusual event was the escape of Ogyen Trinley Dorje from Tibet to Dharamsala, India. Ogyen Trinley Dorje is one of the two rival claimants who seeks recognition as the 17th Karmapa, the head of the Black Hat branch of Tibetan Buddhism (see Karmapa controversy). The two claimants did battle in the Indian court system for control of the considerable funds collected by the 16th Karmapa for the restoration and maintenance of Rumtek Monastery, located in Gangtok, Sikkim. The Chinese, who recognise Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the true Karmapa, were unhappy about the court outcome which awarded the monastery funds to the other rival. However, the Chinese government was in a quandary as to what to do about it, as any protest to India would mean an explicit endorsement that the high court of India holds jurisdiction over Sikkim.\\r\\nIn 2003, with the thawing of relations between the two nations, Indian sovereignty over Sikkim was finally recognised by China. The two governments also proposed to open the Nathula and Jelepla Passes in 2005.\\r\\nOn 18 September 2011, a magnitude 6.9Mw earthquake struck Sikkim, killing at least 116 people in the state and in Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Tibet.[25] More than 60 people died in Sikkim alone, and the city of Gangtok suffered significant damage.[26]\\r\\n{{Navbox","input":"How sikkim became a part of indian union?"},{"output":"the early 20th century","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor thousands of years, humans have tried to explain and control problematic behavior. But our efforts always derive from theories or models of behavior popular at the time, and the purpose is to explain 'why someone is like that'. Three major models, namely, supernatural model, biological model and psychological model.[1]\\r\\nFor much of our recorded history, deviant behavior has been considered a reflection of the battle between good and evil. When confronted with unexplainable, irrational behavior and by suffering and upheaval, people have perceived evil. In fact, in the Great Persian Empire from 900 to 600 B.C., all physical and mental disorders were considered the work of the devil.[2]\\r\\nPhysical causes of mental disorders have been sought in history. Important to this tradition are a man, Hippocrates; a disease, syphilis; and the early consequences of believing that psychological disorders are biologically caused.[3]\\r\\nThis was a precursor to modern psychosocial treatment approaches to the causation of psychopathology, with the focus on psychological, social and cultural factors. Well known philosophers like Aristotle, Plato, etc., wrote about the importance of fantasies, dreams, cognitions, and thus anticipated, to some extent, later developments in psychoanalytic thought and cognitive science. They also advocated humane and responsible care for individuals with psychological disturbances.[4]\\r\\nMental illnesses were well known in ancient Mesopotamia,[5] where diseases and mental disorders were believed to be caused by specific deities.[6] Because hands symbolized control over a person, mental illnesses were known as \\"hands\\" of certain deities.[6] One psychological illness was known as Qt I?tar, meaning \\"Hand of Ishtar\\".[6] Others were known as \\"Hand of Shamash\\", \\"Hand of the Ghost\\", and \\"Hand of the God\\".[6] Descriptions of these illnesses, however, are so vague that it is usually impossible to determine which illnesses they correspond to in modern terminology.[6] Mesopotamian doctors kept detailed record of their patients' hallucinations and assigned spiritual meanings to them.[5] A patient who hallucinated that he was seeing a dog was predicted to die;[5] whereas, if he saw a gazelle, he would recover.[5] The royal family of Elam was notorious for its members frequently suffering from insanity.[5] Erectile dysfunction was recognized as being rooted in psychological problems.[5]\\r\\nLimited notes in an ancient Egyptian document known as the Ebers papyrus appear to describe the affected states of concentration, attention, and emotional distress in the heart or mind.[7] Some of these were interpreted later, and renamed as hysteria and melancholy. Somatic treatments included applying bodily fluids while reciting magical spells. Hallucinogens may have been used as a part of the healing rituals. Religious temples may have been used as therapeutic retreats, possibly for the induction of receptive states to facilitate sleep and the interpretation of dreams.[8]\\r\\nAncient Hindu scriptures-Ramayana and Mahabharata-contain fictional descriptions of depression and anxiety.[9] Mental disorders were generally thought to reflect abstract metaphysical entities, supernatural agents, sorcery and witchcraft. The Charaka Samhita from circa 600 BC, which is a part of the Hindu Ayurveda (\\"knowledge of life\\"), saw ill health as resulting from an imbalance among three the three body fluids or forces called Tri-Dosha. These also affected the personality types among people. Suggested causes included inappropriate diet, disrespect towards the gods, teachers or others, mental shock due to excessive fear or joy, and faulty bodily activity. Treatments included the use of herbs and ointments, charms and prayers, and moral or emotional persuasion.[10]\\r\\nThe earliest known record of mental illness in ancient China dates back to 1100 B.C.[11] Mental disorders were treated mainly under Traditional Chinese Medicine using herbs, acupuncture or \\"emotional therapy\\". The Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor described symptoms, mechanisms and therapies for mental illness, emphasizing connections between bodily organs and emotions. The ancient Chinese believed that demonic possession played a role in mental illness during this time period. They felt that areas of emotional outbursts such as funeral homes could open up the Wei Chi and allow entities to possess an individual. Trauma was also considered to be something that caused high levels of emotion. Thus, trauma is a possible catalyst for mental illness, due to its ability to allow the Wei Chi open to possession. This explains why the ancient Chinese believed that a mental illness was in reality a demonic possession.[12] According to Chinese thought, five stages or elements comprised the conditions of imbalance between Yin and yang. Mental illness, according to the Chinese perspective is thus considered as an imbalance of the yin and yang because optimum health arises from balance with nature.[13]\\r\\nChina was one of the earliest developed civilizations in which medicine and attention to mental disorders were introduced (Soong, 2006)As in the West, Chinese views of mental disorders regressed to a belief in supernatural forces as causal agents. From the later part of the second century through the early part of the ninth century, ghosts and devils were implicated in ghostevil insanity, which presumably resulted from possession by evil spirits. The Dark Ages in China, however, were neither so severe (in terms of the treatment of mental patients) nor as long-lasting as in the West. A return to biological, somatic (bodily) views and an emphasis on psychosocial factors occurred in the centuries that followed. Over the past 50 years, China has been experiencing a broadening of ideas in mental health services and has been incorporating many ideas from Western psychiatry (Zhang & Lu, 2006) [14]\\r\\nIn ancient Greece and Rome, madness was associated stereotypically with aimless wandering and violence. However, Socrates considered positive aspects including prophesying (a 'manic art'); mystical initiations and rituals; poetic inspiration; and the madness of lovers. Now often seen as the very epitome of rational thought and as the founder of philosophy, Socrates freely admitted to experiencing what are now called \\"command hallucinations\\" (then called his 'daemon'). Pythagoras also heard voices.[15] Hippocrates (470ÿca. 360 BC) classified mental disorders, including paranoia, epilepsy, mania and melancholia.[16]\\r\\nThrough long contact with Greek culture, and their eventual conquest of Greece, the Romans absorbed many Greek (and other) ideas on medicine.[17] The humoral theory fell out of favor in some quarters. The Greek physician Asclepiades (ca. 124ÿ40 BC), who practiced in Rome, discarded it and advocated humane treatments, and had insane persons freed from confinement and treated them with natural therapy, such as diet and massages. Arateus (ca. AD 30ÿ90) argued that it is hard to pinpoint from where a mental illness comes. However, Galen (AD 129ÿca. 200), practicing in Greece and Rome, revived humoral theory.[18] Galen, however, adopted a single symptom approach rather than broad diagnostic categories, for example studying separate states of sadness, excitement, confusion and memory loss.[15]\\r\\nPlaywrights such as Homer, Sophocles and Euripides described madmen driven insane by the gods, imbalanced humors or circumstances. As well as the triad (of which mania was often used as an overarching term for insanity) there were a variable and overlapping range of terms for such things as delusion, eccentricity, frenzy, and lunacy. Physician Celsus argued that insanity is really present when a continuous dementia begins due to the mind being at the mercy of imaginings. He suggested that people must heal their own souls through philosophy and personal strength. He described common practices of dietetics, bloodletting, drugs, talking therapy, incubation in temples, exorcism, incantations and amulets, as well as restraints and \\"tortures\\" to restore rationality, including starvation, being terrified suddenly, agitation of the spirit, and stoning and beating. Most, however, did not receive medical treatment but stayed with family or wandered the streets, vulnerable to assault and derision. Accounts of delusions from the time included people who thought themselves to be famous actors or speakers, animals, inanimate objects, or one of the gods. Some were arrested for political reasons, such as Jesus ben Ananias who was eventually released as a madman after showing no concern for his own fate during torture.\\r\\nPassages of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament have been interpreted as describing mood disorders in figures such as Job, King Saul and in the Psalms of David.[18] In the Book of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar is described as temporarily losing his sanity.[19] Mental disorder was not a problem like any other, caused by one of the gods, but rather caused by problems in the relationship between the individual and God.[citation needed] They believed that abnormal behavior was the result of possessions that represented the wrath and punishment from God. This punishment was seen as a withdrawal of God's protection and the abandonment of the individual to evil forces.[20]\\r\\nPersian and Arabic scholars were heavily involved in translating, analyzing and synthesizing Greek texts and concepts. As the Muslim world expanded, Greek concepts were integrated with religious thought and over time, new ideas and concepts were developed. Arab texts from this period contain discussions of melancholia, mania, hallucinations, delusions, and other mental disorders. Mental disorder was generally connected to loss of reason, and writings covered links between the brain and disorders, and spiritual/mystical meaning of disorders.[21] wrote about fear and anxiety, anger and aggression, sadness and depression, and obsessions.\\r\\nAuthors who wrote on mental disorders and/or proposed treatments during this period include Al-Balkhi, Al-Razi, Al-Farabi, Ibn-Sina, Al-Majusi[22] Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, Averroes,[23] and Unhammad.[24]\\r\\nSome thought mental disorder could be caused by possession by a djinn (genie), which could be either good or demon-like. There were sometimes beatings to exorcise the djin, or alternatively over-zealous attempts at cures.[25] Islamic views often merged with local traditions. In Morocco the traditional Berber people were animists and the concept of sorcery was integral to the understanding of mental disorder; it was mixed with the Islamic concepts of djin and often treated by religious scholars combining the roles of holy man, sage, seer and sorcerer.[26]\\r\\nThe first psychiatric hospital ward was founded in Baghdad in 705, and insane asylums were built in Fes in the early 8th century, Cairo in 800 and in Damascus and Aleppo in 1270. Insane patients were treated using baths, drugs, music and activities.[citation needed] In the centuries to come, The Muslim world would eventually serve as a critical way station of knowledge for Renaissance Europe, through the Latin translations of many scientific Islamic texts. Ibn-Sina's (Avicenna's) Canon of Medicine became the standard of medical science in Europe for centuries, together with works of Hippocrates and Galen.[27]\\r\\nConceptions of madness in the Middle Ages in Europe were a mixture of the divine, diabolical, magical and transcendental. Theories of the four humors (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood) were applied, sometimes separately (a matter of \\"physic\\") and sometimes combined with theories of evil spirits (a matter of \\"faith\\"). Arnaldus de Villanova (1235ÿ1313) combined \\"evil spirit\\" and Galen-oriented \\"four humours\\" theories and promoted trephining as a cure to let demons and excess humours escape. Other bodily remedies in general use included purges, bloodletting and whipping. Madness was often seen as a moral issue, either a punishment for sin or a test of faith and character. Christian theology endorsed various therapies, including fasting and prayer for those estranged from God and exorcism of those possessed by the devil.[28] Thus, although mental disorder was often thought to be due to sin, other more mundane causes were also explored, including intemperate diet and alcohol, overwork, and grief.[29] The Franciscan monk Bartholomeus Anglicus (ca. 1203?ÿ 1272) described a condition which resembles depression in his encyclopedia, De Proprietatibis Rerum, and he suggested that music would help. A semi-official tract called the Praerogativa regis distinguished between the \\"natural born idiot\\" and the \\"lunatic\\". The latter term was applied to those with periods of mental disorder; deriving from either Roman mythology describing people \\"moonstruck\\" by the goddess Luna[30] or theories of an influence of the moon.[31][32]\\r\\nEpisodes of mass dancing mania are reported from the Middle Ages, \\"which gave to the individuals affected all the appearance of insanity\\".[33] This was one kind of mass delusion or mass hysteria/panic that has occurred around the world through the millennia.[34]\\r\\nThe care of lunatics was primarily the responsibility of the family. In England, if the family were unable or unwilling, an assessment was made by crown representatives in consultation with a local jury and all interested parties, including the subject himself or herself. The process was confined to those with real estate or personal estate, but it encompassed poor as well as rich and took into account psychological and social issues. Most of those considered lunatics at the time probably had more support and involvement from the community than people diagnosed with mental disorders today.[35] As in other eras, visions were generally interpreted as meaningful spiritual and visionary insights; some may have been causally related to mental disorders, but since hallucinations were culturally supported they may not have had the same connections as today.[36]\\r\\nSome mentally disturbed people may have been victims of the witch-hunts that spread in waves in early modern Europe.[37] However, those judged insane were increasingly admitted to local workhouses, poorhouses and jails (particularly the \\"pauper insane\\") or sometimes to the new private madhouses.[38] Restraints and forcible confinement were used for those thought dangerously disturbed or potentially violent to themselves, others or property.[28] The latter likely grew out of lodging arrangements for single individuals (who, in workhouses, were considered disruptive or ungovernable) then there were a few catering each for only a handful of people, then they gradually expanded (e.g. 16 in London in 1774, and 40 by 1819). By the mid-19th century there would be 100 to 500 inmates in each. The development of this network of madhouses has been linked to new capitalist social relations and a service economy, that meant families were no longer able or willing to look after disturbed relatives.[39]\\r\\nMadness was commonly depicted in literary works, such as the plays of Shakespeare.[40][41]\\r\\nBy the end of the 17th century and into the Enlightenment, madness was increasingly seen as an organic physical phenomenon, no longer involving the soul or moral responsibility. The mentally ill were typically viewed as insensitive wild animals. Harsh treatment and restraint in chains was seen as therapeutic, helping suppress the animal passions. There was sometimes a focus on the management of the environment of madhouses, from diet to exercise regimes to number of visitors. Severe somatic treatments were used, similar to those in medieval times.[28] Madhouse owners sometimes boasted of their ability with the whip. Treatment in the few public asylums was also barbaric, often secondary to prisons. The most notorious was Bedlam where at one time spectators could pay a penny to watch the inmates as a form of entertainment.[42][43]\\r\\nConcepts based in humoral theory gradually gave way to metaphors and terminology from mechanics and other developing physical sciences. Complex new schemes were developed for the classification of mental disorders, influenced by emerging systems for the biological classification of organisms and medical classification of diseases.\\r\\nThe term \\"crazy\\" (from Middle English meaning cracked) and insane (from Latin insanus meaning unhealthy) came to mean mental disorder in this period. The term \\"lunacy\\", long used to refer to periodic disturbance or epilepsy, came to be synonymous with insanity. \\"Madness\\", long in use in root form since at least the early centuries AD, and originally meaning crippled, hurt or foolish, came to mean loss of reason or self-restraint. \\"Psychosis\\", from Greek \\"principle of life/animation\\", had varied usage referring to a condition of the mind/soul. \\"Nervous\\", from an Indo-European root meaning to wind or twist, meant muscle or vigor, was adopted by physiologists to refer to the body's electrochemical signalling process (thus called the nervous system), and was then used to refer to nervous disorders and neurosis. \\"Obsession\\", from a Latin root meaning to sit on or sit against, originally meant to besiege or be possessed by an evil spirit, came to mean a fixed idea that could decompose the mind.[44]\\r\\nWith the rise of madhouses and the professionalization and specialization of medicine, there was considerable incentive for medical doctors to become involved. In the 18th century, they began to stake a claim to a monopoly over madhouses and treatments. Madhouses could be a lucrative business, and many made a fortune from them. There were some bourgeois ex-patient reformers who opposed the often brutual regimes, blaming both the madhouse owners and the medics, who in turn resisted the reforms.[39]\\r\\nTowards the end of the 18th century, a moral treatment movement developed, that implemented more humane, psychosocial and personalized approaches. Notable figures included the medic Vincenzo Chiarugi in Italy under Enlightenment leadership; the ex-patient superintendent Pussin and the psychologically inclined medic Philippe Pinel in revolutionary France; the Quakers in England, led by businessman William Tuke; and later, in the United States, campaigner Dorothea Dix.\\r\\nThe 19th century, in the context of industrialization and population growth, saw a massive expansion of the number and size of insane asylums in every Western country, a process called \\"the great confinement\\" or the \\"asylum era\\". Laws were introduced to compel authorities to deal with those judged insane by family members and hospital superintendents. Although originally based on the concepts and structures of moral treatment, they became large impersonal institutions overburdened with large numbers of people with a complex mix of mental and social-economic problems.[38] The success of moral treatment had cast doubt on the approach of medics, and many had opposed it, but by the mid-19th century many became advocates of it but argued that the mad also often had physical/organic problems, so that both approaches were necessary. This argument has been described as an important step in the profession's eventual success in securing a monopoly on the treatment of lunacy. However, it is well documented that very little therapeutic activity occurred in the new asylum system, that medics were little more than administrators who seldom attended to patients, and then mainly for other physical problems.[39]\\r\\nClear descriptions of some syndromes, such as the condition that would later be termed schizophrenia, have been identified as relatively rare prior to the 19th century,[45] although interpretations of the evidence and its implications are inconsistent.[46]\\r\\nNumerous different classification schemes and diagnostic terms were developed by different authorities, taking an increasingly anatomical-clinical descriptive approach. The term \\"psychiatry\\" was coined as the medical specialty became more academically established. Asylum superintendents, later to be psychiatrists, were generally called \\"alienists\\" because they were thought to deal with people alienated from society; they adopted largely isolated and managerial roles in the asylums while milder \\"neurotic\\" conditions were dealt with by neurologists and general physicians, although there was overlap for conditions such as neurasthenia.[47]\\r\\nIn the United States it was proposed that black slaves who tried to escape were suffering from a mental disorder termed drapetomania. It was then argued in scientific journals that mental disorders were rare under conditions of slavery but became more common following emancipation, and later that mental illness in African Americans was due to evolutionary factors or various negative characteristics, and that they were not suitable for therapeutic intervention.[48]\\r\\nBy the 1870s in North America, officials who ran Lunatic Asylums renamed them Insane Asylums. By the late century, the term \\"asylum\\" had lost its original meaning as a place of refuge, retreat or safety, and was associated with abuses that had been widely publicized in the media, including by ex-patient organization the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society and ex-patients like Elizabeth Packard.[30]\\r\\nThe relative proportion of the public officially diagnosed with mental disorders was increasing, however. This has been linked to various factors, including possibly humanitarian concern; incentives for professional status/money; a lowered tolerance of communities for unusual behavior due to the existence of asylums to place them in (this affected the poor the most); and the strain placed on families by industrialization.[39]\\r\\nThe turn of the 20th century saw the development of psychoanalysis, which came to the fore later. Kraepelin's classification gained popularity, including the separation of mood disorders from what would later be termed schizophrenia.[49][page?needed]\\r\\nAsylum superintendents sought to improve the image and medical status of their profession. Asylum \\"inmates\\" were increasingly referred to as \\"patients\\" and asylums renamed as hospitals. Referring to people as having a \\"mental illness\\" dates from this period in the early 20th century.[30]\\r\\nIn the United States, a \\"mental hygiene\\" movement, originally defined in the 19th century, gained momentum and aimed to \\"prevent the disease of insanity\\" through public health methods and clinics.[50] The term mental health became more popular, however. Clinical psychology and social work developed as professions alongside psychiatry. Theories of eugenics led to compulsory sterilization movements in many countries around the world for several decades, often encompassing patients in public mental institutions.[51] World War I saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed \\"shell shock\\".\\r\\nIn Nazi Germany, the institutionalized mentally ill were among the earliest targets of sterilization campaigns and covert \\"euthanasia\\" programs.[52] It has been estimated that over 200,000 individuals with mental disorders of all kinds were put to death, although their mass murder has received relatively little historical attention. Despite not being formally ordered to take part, psychiatrists and psychiatric institutions were at the center of justifying, planning and carrying out the atrocities at every stage, and \\"constituted the connection\\" to the later annihilation of Jews and other \\"undesirables\\" such as homosexuals in the Holocaust.[53]\\r\\nIn other areas of the world, funding was often cut for asylums, especially during periods of economic decline, and during wartime in particular many patients starved to death.[54] Soldiers received increased psychiatric attention, and World War II saw the development in the US of a new psychiatric manual for categorizing mental disorders, which along with existing systems for collecting census and hospital statistics led to the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) followed suit with a section on mental disorders.\\r\\nPreviously restricted to the treatment of severely disturbed people in asylums, psychiatrists cultivated clients with a broader range of problems, and between 1917 and 1970 the number practicing outside institutions swelled from 8 percent to 66 percent.[55] The term stress, having emerged from endocrinology work in the 1930s, was popularized with an increasingly broad biopsychosocial meaning, and was increasingly linked to mental disorders.[56] \\"Outpatient commitment\\" laws were gradually expanded or introduced in some countries.\\r\\nLobotomies, Insulin shock therapy, Electro convulsive therapy, and the \\"neuroleptic\\" chlorpromazine came into use mid-century.\\r\\nAn antipsychiatry movement came to the fore in the 1960s. Deinstitutionalization gradually occurred in the West, with isolated psychiatric hospitals being closed down in favor of community mental health services. However, inadequate services and continued social exclusion often led to many being homeless or in prison.[57] A consumer/survivor movement gained momentum.\\r\\nOther kinds of psychiatric medication gradually came into use, such as \\"psychic energizers\\" and lithium. Benzodiazepines gained widespread use in the 1970s for anxiety and depression, until dependency problems curtailed their popularity. Advances in neuroscience and genetics led to new research agendas. Cognitive behavioral therapy was developed. Through the 1990s, new SSRI antidepressants became some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world.\\r\\nThe DSM and then ICD adopted new criteria-based classification, representing a return to a Kraepelin-like descriptive system. The number of \\"official\\" diagnoses saw a large expansion, although homosexuality was gradually downgraded and dropped in the face of human rights protests. Different regions sometimes developed alternatives such as the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders or Latin American Guide for Psychiatric Diagnosis.\\r\\nStarting from 2002 DSM-5 Research Agenda researchers were invited to contribute with their publication to the literature basis for the DSM-5, whose draft criteria are now[when?] available to the scientific community.[58] In the meanwhile, serious limits of the current version of the DSM extremely high comorbidity, diagnostic heterogeneity of the categories, unclear boundaries have been interpreted as intrinsic anomalies of the criterial, neopositivistic approach leading the system to a state of scientific crisis.[59] Accordingly, a radical rethinking of the concept of mental disorder and the need of a radical scientific revolution in psychiatric taxonomy was proposed.[60]\\r\\n[61]\\r\\nThis procedure included removing a part of the skull using an auger, bore or so. It was used 7000 years ago to remove headaches, mental illness and even perceived demonic possession.\\r\\nThis procedures saw its inception in the 1600s. Bleeding, purging and vomiting were thought to keep the balance of humors in the body. According to the Greek philosophy, the imbalance of these humors were considered to cause mental disorders. These techniques were used to treat more than just mental disorders.\\r\\nThe confinement of the mentally ill became prevalent in the 17th century. The idea behind these asylums was to isolate the abnormal and keep them separate from the normal. The poor sanitation conditions, and overcrowding along with violent treatment of the mentally ill were serious problems faced in these asylums.\\r\\nThis treatment was introduced in 1927 and was used till 1960. Physicians deliberately put the patient into a low blood sugar coma because they thought that large fluctuations in insulin levels could alter the function of the brain. Risks included prolong coma. Electro Convulsive Therapy (ECT) was later adopted as a substitution to this.\\r\\nPrefrontal Lobotomies, required the surgical removal of the connections in between the prefrontal cortex and frontal lobes of the brain. The procedure took not more than five minutes to be performed. Though useful for some, it often created further impairments for others. It was discontinued in the mid-1950s.","input":"When was the term mental illness first used?"},{"output":"In 1933","context":"The  agricultural policy of the United States is composed primarily of the periodically renewed federal U.S. farm bills.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 1920s, the first 200 years of agricultural policy in the US was dominated by policies directed at developing and supporting family farms and the inputs of the total agricultural sector, such as land, research, and human labor.[citation needed] Developmental policy included such legislation as the Land Act of 1820, the Homestead Act, which granted 160-acre (0.65?km2) townships, and the Morrill Act of 1862, which initiated the land-grant college system, one in a long series of acts that provided public support for agricultural research and education. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1933, with many farmers losing money because of the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which created the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA).[citation needed]  The AAA began to regulate agricultural production by destroying crops and artificially reducing supplies. It also offered subsidies to farmers to encourage them to willingly limit their production of crops.[citation needed] The Supreme Court later struck down the AAA as unconstitutional, so in 1938 the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act was passed, which essentially created a similar organization for distributing farmer subsidies.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of World War I, the destructive effects of the war and the surrender burdens enforced on the Central Powers of Europe bankrupted much of Europe, closing major export markets in the United States and beginning a series of events that would lead to the development of agricultural price and income support policies. United States price and income support, known otherwise as agricultural subsidy, grew out of acute farm income and financial crises, which led to widespread political beliefs that the market system was not adequately rewarding farm people for their agricultural commodities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with the 1921 Packers and Stockyards Act and 1922 CapperÿVolstead Act, which regulated livestock and protected farmer cooperatives against anti-trust suits, United States agricultural policy began to become more and more comprehensive. In reaction to falling grain prices and the widespread economic turmoil of the Dust Bowl (1931ÿ39) and Great Depression (October 1929ÿ33), three bills led the United States into permanent price subsidies for farmers: the 1922 Grain Futures Act, the June 1929 Agricultural Marketing Act, and finally the 1933 Agricultural Adjustment Act ÿ the first comprehensive food policy legislation. \\r\\n\\r\\nOut of these bills grew a system of government-controlled agricultural commodity prices and government supply control (farmers being paid to leave land unused). Supply control would continue to be used to decrease overproduction, leading to over 50,000,000 acres (200,000?km2) to be set aside during times of low commodity prices (1955ÿ1973, 1984ÿ1995). The practice was eventually ended by the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, a variety of related topics began to be addressed by agricultural policy:  soil conservation (1956 Soil Bank Act), surplus crops as food aid (National School Lunch Act of 1946, Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, the 1964 Food Stamp Act), and much later wetlands and habitat conservation (Food Security Act of 1985, 1990 Wetlands Reserve Program, 1996 Wildlife Habitat and Environmental Quality Incentive Programs and 2002 Grassland Reserve Program) and organic food labeling (Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990). \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time, agricultural financial support also increased, through raised price supports, export subsidies, increased crop insurance (1938 Agricultural Adjustment Act), expanding price supports to different crops (Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000), offering more guaranteed federal loans, and through the replacement of some price supports with fixed payments (Food and Agricultural Act of 1962 and Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996).\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with the administration of Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace, the United States had generally moved to curb overproduction. However, in the early 1970s, under Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz, farmers were encouraged to \\"get big or get out\\" and to plant \\"hedgerow to hedgerow\\". Over the course of the 20th century, farms have consolidated into larger, more capital-intensive operations and subsidy policy under Butz encouraged these large farms at the expense of small and medium-sized family farms.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe percentage of Americans who live on a farm diminished from nearly 25% during the Great Depression to about 2% now,[3] and only 0.1% of the United States population works full-time on a farm. As the agribusiness lobby grows to near $60 million per year,[4] the interests of agricultural corporations remain highly represented. In recent years, farm subsidies have remained high even in times of record farm profits.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA large reason why agricultural policy has favored farmers over the course of United States history is because farmers tend to have favorable proportional political representation in government.[citation needed] The United States Senate tends to grant more power per person to inhabitants of rural states. Also, because the United States House of Representatives is re-apportioned only every 10 years by the United States Census, and population tends to shift from rural to urban areas, farmers are often left with greater proportional power until the re-apportionment is complete.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the majority of agricultural policy research is funded by the USDA. Some economists believe this creates an incentive for government intervention because, among other considerations, the USDA will most likely not fund research criticizing its own activities.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"When did farm subsidies begin in the u.s?"},{"output":"14,727,584","context":"","input":"What is the total population of new england?"},{"output":"a map projection","context":"The Robinson projection is a map projection of a world map which shows the entire world at once. It was specifically created in an attempt to find a good compromise to the problem of readily showing the whole globe as a flat image.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Robinson projection was devised by Arthur H. Robinson in 1963 in response to an appeal from the Rand McNally company, which has used the projection in general purpose world maps since that time. Robinson published details of the projection's construction in 1974. The National Geographic Society (NGS) began using the Robinson projection for general purpose world maps in 1988, replacing the Van der Grinten projection.[2] In 1998 NGS abandoned the Robinson projection for that use in favor of the Winkel tripel projection, as the latter \\"reduces the distortion of land masses as they near the poles\\".[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Robinson projection is neither equal-area nor conformal, abandoning both for a compromise. The creator felt this produced a better overall view than could be achieved by adhering to either. The meridians curve gently, avoiding extremes, but thereby stretch the poles into long lines instead of leaving them as points.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHence, distortion close to the poles is severe, but quickly declines to moderate levels moving away from them. The straight parallels imply severe angular distortion at the high latitudes toward the outer edges of the map, a fault inherent in any pseudocylindrical projection. However, at the time it was developed, the projection effectively met Rand McNally's goal to produce appealing depictions of the entire world.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nI decided to go about it backwards.  I started with a kind of artistic approach. I visualized the best-looking shapes and sizes. I worked with the variables until it got to the point where, if I changed one of them, it didn't get any better. Then I figured out the mathematical formula to produce that effect. Most mapmakers start with the mathematics.\\r\\nThe projection is defined by the table:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table is indexed by latitude at 5 degree intervals; intermediate values are calculated using interpolation. Robinson did not specify any particular interpolation method, but it is reported that he used Aitken interpolation himself.[7] The PLEN column is the length of the parallel of latitude, and the PDFE column is multiplied by 0.5072 to obtain the distance of that parallel from the equator. Meridians of longitude are equally spaced on each parallel of latitude.","input":"What type of projection is the robinson projection?"},{"output":"Park Geun-hye","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPark Geun-hye (Hangul:????; Hanja:?; RR:?Bak Geun(-)hye; IPA:?[pak?k??n.hje]; born 2 February 1952) is a former South Korean politician who served as the 18th President of South Korea from 2013 to 2017. Park was the first woman to be President of South Korea[2] and also the first female president popularly elected as head of state in East Asia. She was also the first South Korean president to be born after the country's founding; her predecessors were either born during Japanese rule or during the post-World War II transitional period.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to her presidency, Park was chairwoman of the conservative Grand National Party (GNP) (which changed its name to Saenuri Party in February 2012) from 2004 to 2006 and 2011 to 2012. She was also a member of the National Assembly, serving four consecutive parliamentary terms between 1998 and 2012. She started her fifth term as a representative elected by national list in June 2012. Her father, Park Chung-hee, was the President of South Korea from 1963 to 1979, serving five consecutive terms after he seized power in 1961.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 and 2014, Park was ranked 11th on the Forbes list of the world's 100 most powerful women and the most powerful woman in East Asia.[3] In 2014, she was ranked 46th on the Forbes list of the world's most powerful people, the third-highest South Korean on the list, after Lee Kun-hee and Lee Jae-yong.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 December 2016, Park was impeached by the National Assembly on charges related to influence peddling by her top aide, Choi Soon-sil.[4] Her presidential powers and duties were suspended with the ratification of the impeachment. ThenÿPrime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn thus assumed those powers and duties as Acting President.[5] The impeachment was upheld by the Constitutional Court via a unanimous 8ÿ0 ruling  on 10 March 2017, thereby removing Park from office.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 April 2018, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison.[7] Park is currently held under arrest at Seoul Detention Center.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark was born on 2 February 1952, in Samdeok-dong of Jung District, Daegu, as the first child of Park Chung-hee, the 3rd president of South Korea who served between 1963 and 1979, and Yuk Young-soo. She has a younger brother, Park Ji-man, and a younger sister, Park Geun-ryeong.[9] She is unmarried with no children. Pew Research Center described her as an atheist with a Buddhist and Roman Catholic upbringing.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to her native Korean, Park also speaks English, French, Spanish, and Mandarin with varying degrees of fluency.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1953, Park's family moved to Seoul and she graduated from Seoul's Jangchung Elementary School and Sungshim (literal: Sacred Heart) Girls' Middle and High School in 1970, going on to receive a bachelor's degree in electronic engineering from Sogang University in 1974.[citation needed] She briefly studied at Joseph Fourier University, but left France following the murder of her mother.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark's mother was killed on 15 August 1974 in the National Theater of Korea; Mun Se-gwang, a Japanese-born ethnic Korean sympathizer of North Korea and member of the Chongryon, was attempting to assassinate President Park Chung-hee.[12] Park was regarded as First Lady until the assassination of her father by his own intelligence chief, Kim Jae-gyu, on 26 October 1979.[13][14][15] During this time, activists who were political opponents of her father claimed to be subject to arbitrary detention. Further, human rights were considered subordinate to economic development.[16] In 2007, Park expressed regret at the treatment of activists during this period.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark received honorary doctoral degrees from the Chinese Culture University in Taiwan in 1987, Pukyong National University and KAIST in 2008, Sogang University in 2010, and TU Dresden in 2014.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark was elected a Grand National Party (GNP) assemblywoman for Dalseong County, Daegu, in 1998 by-election, and three more times in the same electoral district between 1998 and 2008, being the incumbent assemblywoman till April 2012. In 2012, she announced that she would not run for a constituency representative seat for the 19th election in Dalseong or anywhere else, but for a proportional representative position for the Saenuri Party instead, in order to lead the party's election campaign.[19] She was elected as a proportional representative in the April 2012 election.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the failed attempt to impeach President Roh Moo-hyun and the bribery scandal of its 2002 presidential candidate, Lee Hoi-chang (revealed in 2004), the GNP was facing a severe defeat in the 2004 general election. Park was appointed as the chairwoman of the party and led the election efforts. In the election, the GNP lost its majority position but managed to gain 121 seats, which is largely considered a great achievement under such inhospitable circumstances for the party.[22][23] As the chairwoman of the GNP, Park helped her party make significant gains in local elections and actually obtain a majority in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the campaign, on 20 May 2006, Ji Chung-ho, a 50-year-old man with eight criminal convictions, slashed Park's face with a utility knife, causing an 11-centimeter wound that required 60 stitches and several hours of surgery.[24][25] A famous anecdote from this incident occurred when Park was hospitalized after the attack. The first word that she said to her secretary after her recovery from her wound was \\"How is Daejeon?\\" After this, the candidate from the Grand National Party won the election for mayor of the city of Daejeon despite having trailed by more than 20 percentage points in opinion polls up to the point of the attack. In addition, during her term as the GNP chairwoman between 2004 and 2006, the party won all 40 reelections and by-elections held, which was largely credited to her influence and efforts. This feat gave Park a nickname \\"Queen of Elections\\".[26][27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 February 2007, Park made a much-publicized visit to Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Her visit culminated in an address to a packed audience at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, where she said she wanted to save Korea and advocated a stronger relationship between South Korea and the United States.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark hoped to emulate her father's success by becoming the presidential nominee of the Grand National Party.[21] She eventually lost to Lee Myung-bak by a narrow margin. Lee had a commanding lead at the beginning of the primary season, but Park was able to narrow the gap through allegations of Lee's corruption. Park won the \\"party members' bid\\", but she lost the \\"national bid\\", which is a larger percentage of the total presidential bid.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 2007 presidential election, President Lee Myung-bak formed a government of mostly close supporters.[31] Park's supporters argued that this was a kind of political reprisal, and that they should secede from the Grand National Party.[32] Eventually, they formed parties named Pro-Park Coalition and Solidarity for Pro-Park Independents (?? ??? ??; Chin Park Musosok Yeondae). Park herself did not join them, but indirectly supported them by announcing \\"I hope these people will come back alive.\\" After the mass secession, the rebels announced that they would rejoin GNP after the general election, but the GNP prohibited it. In the following 2008 general election, the rebels won 26 seats: 14 from the Pro-Park Coalition and 12 as independents. Together, they played a pivotal role in the GNP's narrow majority. Park continually insisted that GNP should allow the return of her supporters. As of 2011, most of these rebels had returned to the GNP, resulting in approximately 50 to 60 assembly members who support Park out of 171 in the GNP.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a response to the dwindling approval rating of the GNP, the party formed an emergency committee and changed the name of the political party from the Grand National Party to the Saenuri Party, meaning \\"New Frontier\\" Party.[19] On 19 December 2011, Park was appointed as the chairwoman of GNP's Emergency Committee, the de facto leader of the party.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Saenuri Party achieved a surprise win against the opposing Democratic United Party in the 2012 General Election, winning 152 seats and retaining its majority position. Because of the corruption scandals of the Lee administration revealed before the election, the Saenuri Party was widely expected to win no more than 100 seats.[33] During the 13-day campaign period, Park traveled about 7,200?km (4,500?mi) around South Korea, visiting more than 100 constituencies.[34] It is the consensus of Korean news media and political experts that the most important factor leading to Saenuri Party's victory was Park's leadership. For this reason, the 2012 election was often dubbed the \\"return of the Queen of Election\\".[33][35] Saenuri's defeat in the populous Seoul metropolitan area in this election, however, revealed the limitation of Park's political influence.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark had been the leading candidate for the 2012 presidential election in every national-level poll in South Korea between 2008, when the Lee Myung-bak administration began, and September 2011, with an approval rating of 25% to 45%, more than twice that of the second candidate. Park's approval rating was highest when the 2008 National Assembly election showed her strong influence and lowest in early 2010 as a result of her political stance against the Lee administration in Sejong City issue.[36]\\r\\nIn September 2011, Ahn Cheol-soo, a former venture IT?businessman and the Dean of Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology at Seoul National University, emerged as a strong independent candidate for the presidency. In national-level presidential polls in September 2011, Ahn and Park Geun Hye closely competed for the status of front-runner, with Park losing the top seat in some polls for the first time since 2008.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter her victory in the 2012 General Election, Park's approval rating increased significantly. In a national-level survey by Mono Research on 30 August[38] Park was the top presidential candidate with an approval rating of 45.5% when competing with all potential candidates, and according to another recent national survey result, had a higher approval rating (50.6%) than Ahn (43.9%) in a two-way competition with him as of 11 September.[39]\\r\\nOn 10 July, Park formally announced her 2012 presidential bid at the Time Square, Yeongdeungpo District, Seoul. In this event she emphasized the right to pursue happiness, a democratic economy, and customized welfare services for the Korean people.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opposing Democratic Party elected Moon Jae-in as its presidential candidate on 17 September, while Ahn Cheol-soo announced his presidential bid on 19 September. Although still a leading candidate, Park had a lower approval rating than both Ahn and Moon when engaged in two-way competition, according to a 22 September national survey.[41] She was elected as the President of the Republic of Korea on 19 December 2012 with the approval of 51.6% of Korean voters.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, the NSI has admitted it conducted an illicit campaign to influence the South Korea's 2012 presidential election, mobilising teams of experts in psychological warfare to ensure that the conservative candidate, Park Geun-hye, beat her liberal rival Moon Jae-in.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2012 survey by Korean Research assessing the political stance of 12 potential presidential candidates of South Korea, Park was considered the most conservative candidate.[19][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nHer conservative, market-oriented political stance was well reflected in her campaign pledge for 2008 presidential bid to cut taxes, reduce regulation, and establish strong law and order.[45] Since 2009, however, Park started to focus more on welfare issues, advocating customized welfare services to the South Korean people.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark is well known for her strict, no-compromise adherence to political promises. In 2010, for example, she successfully stopped the Lee administration's attempt to cancel the plan to establish Sejong City, a new national center of administration, arguing the plan was a promise made to people. This conflict between Park and Lee Administration cost her a considerable decrease in her approval rating at the time.[46] In 2012, Park also vowed to construct a new airport in the southeastern region, a 2008 presidential campaign promise made by GNP but cancelled in 2011, despite claims of economic infeasibility of the plan.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe administrative vision of President Park Geun-hye's new government is \\"a new era of hope and happiness\\". The five Administrative Goals of the government are \\"a jobs-centered creative economy\\", \\"tailored employment and welfare\\", \\"creativity-oriented education and cultural enrichment\\", \\"a safe and united society\\" and \\"strong security measures for sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula\\". The Park Geun-hye administration plans to create a trustworthy, clean, and capable government through carrying out these goals, related strategies, and tasks.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark chose not to vote in the 2017 South Korean presidential election.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark became the 18th president of South Korea on 25 February 2013. At midnight, she took over all presidential authorities including the prerogative of supreme command of South Korea's armed forces from her predecessor Lee Myung-bak. In her inauguration speech at the National Assembly building, Park spoke of her plan to open a new era of hope through \\"economic prosperity, people's happiness, and cultural enrichment\\". She particularly expressed her hope that North Korea would give up its nuclear arms and walk on the path of peace and mutual development, and declared that the foundation for a happy era of unification in which all Korean people will be able to enjoy prosperity and freedom and realize their dreams would be built through the Korean Peninsula Trust-building Process. In her inauguration speech, Park presented four guiding principles to realize her administrative vision: economic prosperity, people's happiness, cultural enrichment, and establishment of foundation for peaceful unification.[50] Park's inauguration ceremony was the largest one in South Korean history with 70,000 participants. Diplomatic representatives in Korea as well as high-level delegates specially sent from 24 countries around the world including Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, U.S. National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon, Taiwanese Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda also participated in the event to congratulate Park.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal of the newly launched Park Geun-hye Administration for governing state affairs is to open \\"a new era of hope and happiness for all the people\\". Park avowed that South Korea will break away from its long-pursued development model that centers around the nation, and shift the focus of government administration from the state to individual citizens. Through this process the structure of co-prosperity, in which the citizens become happy and as a result the nation develops, will be created. Park's administrative vision and basic principles for governing the nation are concretely outlined in her policy plans for the economy, society, welfare, diplomacy, and unification. The administration's keywords in managing state affairs are \\"people\\", \\"happiness\\", \\"trust\\", \\"co-prosperity\\" and \\"principle\\".[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nRight after taking office, Park restructured the Blue House and government organization to carry out her administrative vision. The Office of National Security at the Blue House, Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, and Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries were newly launched, and the seat of Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs was revived. The Chief of the National Security Office would act as a \\"control tower\\" for diplomatic, security, and national defense issues, and the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs for economic, social, and welfare issues.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter taking office, Park met with John Kerry and U.S. President Barack Obama. Park's trip to the United States in May 2013 was her first foreign trip after taking office.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many of her predecessors, Park has maintained a close relationship with the U.S., which has over 20,000 soldiers stationed in South Korea. During her visit to the U.S., she addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress, where she called for a united front against any North Korean provocations. Park also called for a strong global relationship between South Korea and the United States.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark assesses the security situation on the Korean Peninsula and emphasized that deterrence capabilities were the most important factor for security. Thus, Park considers the American-South Korean alliance as the most successful one in the world. And she hopes the American-South Korean relationship can be upgraded from a comprehensive strategic alliance to a global partnership.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark visited the United States on her first overseas trip as president. She traveled to Washington, D.C., New York City, and Los Angeles on 5ÿ9 May 2013.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring summit talks in May at the White House, Presidents Park and Obama adopted a joint declaration for the American-South Korean alliance and discussed ways to further develop the bilateral relations in a future-forward manner. Also, two leaders discussed ways to promote cooperation in building peace in the Northeast Asian region and strength the partnership between Seoul and Washington.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two leaders of South Korea and the United States agreed to adopt a joint statement on comprehensive energy cooperation to build a foundation for a future growth engine and establish a policy cooperation committee on information and communication technology. In addition, President Park urged her U.S. counterpart to expand the annual U.S. visa quota for South Korean professionals in order to promote co-development of both economies.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn particular, the \\"Joint declaration in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the Alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States of America\\" adopted by South Korea and the United States will become a meaningful document looking back at the past six decades of the alliance and spelling out a new direction for the development of bilateral relations over the coming decade.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Korea had engaged in provocations such as violating a UN Security Council resolution and firing a long-range missile on 12 December 2012, just before 19 December presidential election. After Park was elected, North Korea conducted its third nuclear test 12 February 2013, nullified the non-aggression agreements between the two countries on 8 March and withdrew North Korean workers from the Kaesong Industrial Complex on 8 April.[61] Park maintained her stance that South Korea will not succumb to the North's provocations and threats, and will endeavor to elicit policy coordination towards North Korea with major powers such as the United States, China and the UN.[62] Her response to North Korean issues gained the support of many South Koreans and also the United States, China, and Russia, and played a significant role in the unanimous adoption by the UN Security Council of Resolution 2094 regarding North Korea on 7 March 2013.[63] Due to Park's response and the international community's actions, on 6 June North Korea ceased provocations and threats towards the South and suggested holding discussions on reopening the Kaesong Industrial Complex.[64]\\r\\nPark said that peace and unification on the Korean peninsula is the wish of all 70 million Koreans and that as president she will do her utmost to meet such a goal. As well, \\"the ultimate objective of reunification efforts is to improve the quality of life of people in both Koreas, to further expand freedom and human rights, and [from there] build a prosperous Korean Peninsula.\\"[65] She later stated, \\"to open a new era of peace and hope on the peninsula, North Korea needs to accept her administration's trust building policy initiative\\".[66][67]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark's policy vision and initiative on issues concerning North Korea and unification are reflected in her Korean Peninsula Trust-building Process. The Ministry of Unification has announced a new vision statement \\"realizing a new unified Korea that ensures everyone's happiness\\". The administrative tasks for this cause include normalizing inter-Korean relations through a trust-building process, embarking on small-scale unification projects that will lead to a complete integration of the two Koreas, and taking practical measures to prepare for unification by strengthening unification capabilities.[68] According to Park, peaceful unification will be achieved in a three-stage unification initiative: starting from securing peace, going through economic integration, and finally reaching political integration. To achieve sustainable peace by the initiative, the new administration will offer humanitarian assistance for the people in North Korea, inter-Korean exchange and cooperation in economic, social and cultural areas, and will apply 'Vision Korea project' for establishing a single economic community in the Korean Peninsula, conditioned on sufficient mutual trust and progress in denuclearizing North Korea.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 27ÿ30 June 2013, Park visited China with a South Korean delegation, where she met with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. During the meetings, Park explained the government's stance on North Korea and gained his support.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 November 2013, Park held an extended summit with President Vladimir Putin, whose visit to South Korea was the first among leaders of 4 major powers including the United States, China, and Japan. During the summit, Park and Putin had a comprehensive and productive dialogue with focus on improving economic relations such as logistics cooperation projects (through Russia and North Korea), expanding people-to-people exchanges, and strengthening political ties between South Korea and Russia. Park, especially, emphasized on making preparations to produce an outcome that corresponds to common interests by combining Korea's Eurasian Initiative and Russia's Asia-Pacific Policy. After the summit, both presidents issued a joint communique and held a joint press conference.[71][72] Earlier, Park attended the G-20 Summit at St. Petersburg in September 2013, where she met Putin for a separate dialogue discussing economic cooperation and seeking support on North Korean issues. It marked the first Korea-Russia summit talk since Park's inauguration.[73] When Park met with Russian Minister for the Development of Russian Far East Viktor Ishaev, who headed the Russian delegation to Park's inaugural ceremony, she stated that Russia is one of Korea's key strategic partners, and the successful launch of the Naro rocket is the outcome of mutually beneficial relations and demonstrates that relations will grow stronger in the future. She also noted that Russia's active participation in the six-party talks will contribute to alleviating tension on the Korean Peninsula.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark announced her plan to build a \\"Creative Economy\\" on 5 June 2013, representing her vision for economic revival and job creation.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April, Park said \\"Timing is very important for our economic policy, jobs and livelihood mainly ordinary people should organize a supplementary budget in a timely manner.\\"[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 April 2014, Park signed the AustraliaÿKorea Free Trade Agreement with Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark has proposed as one item on the national agenda the eradication of \\"Four Major Social Evils\\" (? ???:\\r\\n\\"sam[4] dae-sahweak\\")?ÿ sexual violence, domestic violence, school violence and unsafe food. Statistics show that sexual violence and domestic violence are increasing in these years. Without referring to statistical data, aggravating school violence or food safety is a public concern in South Korea.[78][79] She also launched the National Unity Committee on 17 June with the purpose to advise the president in the process of resolving various conflicts in South Korean society and establishing a culture of co-existence and co-prosperity. Former Democratic United Party Advisor Han Kwang -ok was named as the head.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 May 2013, President Park Geun-hye attended the 33rd anniversary of the Gwangju massacre, and gave voice to sorrow for the victims' family members.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark proposed three steps to North Korea to help move toward the reunification of the Korean Peninsula, on 28 March in Dresden during her state visit to Germany.[82]\\r\\nAnd marking the Korean Peninsula's liberation from Japan's colonial rule Friday (8.15), President Park said, as anguish from the two Koreas' separation passes from one generation to the next, abnormalities on the divided peninsula have become the norm. The South Korean president then highlighted the urgent need to increase understanding and to help merge the lives of South and North Koreans for reunification. \\"Starting with jointly managing rivers and forests running through the two Koreas, we need to expand joint projects that benefit both sides. In that respect, I hope North Korea will attend the UN Convention on Biological Diversity conference to be held in South Korean city of Pyeongchang in October.\\"[83]\\r\\nPresident Park Geun-hye has warned that a new nuclear test by North Korea could lead to, \\"a nuclear domino effect\\", that might provide its neighbors with a pretext to arm themselves with nuclear weapons, as she sat down with Wall Street Journal Managing Editor Gerard Baker in Seoul on 28 May.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 May 2014, Park announced South Korea's \\"plans to break up its coastguard\\" after failing to respond well during the MV Sewol ferry disaster.[85] According to Park, \\"investigation and information roles would be transferred to the South Korea National Police while the rescue and salvage operation and ocean security roles would be transferred to the Department for National Safety, not to be confused with the Korean Ministry of Security and Public Administration, which will be newly established\\".[86]\\r\\nOn 19 November 2014, the Korea Coast Guard and National Emergency Management Agency ceased control as the Ministry of Public Safety and Security was founded at the same day.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 26 May 2015, Park urged the head of the Asian Development Bank to cooperate with South Korea and the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank[88] after South Korea had officially applied to join the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in late March 2015.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 May 2016, Park became the first South Korean president to visit Iran.[90][91] She was at the head of a 236-member delegation of businessmen and entrepreneurs during a three-day visit to Tehran to discuss bilateral trade and other matters of mutual interest.[92] She met Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and held talks with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.[93] The two countries also signed 19 basic agreements to expand mutual cooperation over a variety of areas.[94] Earlier, Iran's President Rouhani emphasized that Iran and South Korea are set to boost their trade volume from the current $6 billion to $18 billion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPark suffered a serious setback in the 2016 general elections on 13 April 2016, as the Saenuri Party lost both its majority and its status as first party in the National Assembly.[95] Park had been criticized for her involvement in the elections and the party's nomination process,[96][97] and other Saenuri members blamed the pro-Park faction in the party for the defeat.[98] Park loyalists fared badly in constituency elections.[99] The result was seen to hinder the chances of Park's passing her proposed economic reforms,[100] and in the aftermath of the results the conservative The Chosun Ilbo stated that Park's \\"lame duck period has started earlier than any other administration in the past\\".[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2013, public support for Park's method of governing state affairs reached up to 63 percent, much higher than the percentage of the votes she had won in the presidential election, which is 52 percent.[102] The Korean media explained that such a high level of support comes from Park's principled North Korea policy, constructive outcome from visits to the United States and China, and distancing away from internal political disputes.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy January 2015, Park's approval rating had fallen to 30 percent, partly due to the sinking of MV Sewol and disputes with North Korea.[104] By September 2015, Park's approval had increased to 54 percent due to her diplomacy that defused a military standoff with North Korea,[105] but in the aftermath of her party's 2016 election loss, her ratings fell back to 31.5 percent, plunging 8.1 percentage points compared to the week before the election.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 November 2016, Park's ratings fell to 4ÿ5% as details of her relationship with Choi Soon-sil were investigated and exposed in what became the 2016 South Korean political scandal.[107][108][109]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark was arrested on 31 March 2017, and held in pre-trial detention at the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province.[110][111] On 17 April 2017, Park was formally charged with abuse of power, bribery, coercion, and leaking government secrets.[112] Park denied the charges during five rounds of interrogation while in jail.[112][113][114]\\r\\n\\r\\nProsecutors sought a 30-year jail term for Park, along with a fine of ?118,500,000,000 (US$110,579,397).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 April 2018, a three-judge panel of the Central District Court in Seoul sentenced Park to 24 years in prison and a fine of ?18,000,000,000 (US$16,798,683), finding her guilty of 16 out of 18 charges brought before her.[115][116][117][118]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2018 three former NIS directors (Lee Byung-kee, Lee Byung-ho, and Nam Jae-joon) who served in the Park administration were found guilty of bribing, related to the 2016 Park Geun-hye scandals. They illegally transferred money from the NIS budget to Park's presidential office. This illegally obtained money was used by Park and her associates for private use and to pay bribes.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark had been often criticized for being the \\"daughter of a dictator (Park Chung-hee)\\"[120][121] and for not actively supporting the Lee administration by supporters of Lee Myung-bak. A national-level poll conducted in July 2012 by a conservative newspaper reported that 59% of participants responded they did not believe Park was a \\"daughter of a dictator\\" while 36% agreed with the characterization.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a recent interview with the Cheongju broadcast station CJB, Park commented regarding her stance that her father's May 16 coup was a \\"revolution to save the country\\" by stating, \\"I don't think it's the place of politicians to be fighting over whether [the events of 1961] were a 'coup d'etat' or a 'revolution'.\\"[123] In a July 2012 survey, 50% of respondents answered that they disagreed with Park's assessment that her father's 1961 coup was \\"unavoidable, the best possible choice, and an advisable decision\\", as opposed to 37% that agreed.[124] From another survey conducted in July 2012, 42% of respondents agreed with her opinion that her father's 1961 coup was \\"unavoidable\\", while 46% disagreed.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark has faced much scrutiny over an educational foundation, Jeongsoo Scholarship Foundation, formerly known as Buil (in reference to the stock it controls in the newspaper \\"Busan Ilbo\\"), which her father, and later she, headed. Its original owners claimed in court they were forced to turn it over to her father.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Saenuri Party assemblyman Nam Kyung-pil criticized the Park-centered nature of the party, regarding its preparation for the 2012 presidential election, and stated, \\"If we keep seeing the same situation where Park Geun-hye gives a press conference before a general meeting of lawmakers is held, and what she says then gets decided on as the party's position, then the public is going to think democracy has disappeared from the party.\\"[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, some have said Park's behavior in the lead-up to 2012 presidential election was a mixture of trend-following and corner-cuttinga stark contrast with the vehement insistence on principle that she showed when she opposed a revision of the plan for a multifunctional administrative city in Sejong City. For instance, Yim Tae-hee, another presidential candidate of the party, pointed to Park's voting down of a motion to arrest Chung Doo-un, a lawmaker implicated with bribery related to saving banks. Another candidate, Ahn Sang-soo, accused Park of \\"saying one thing yesterday and another today\\".[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark fired Yoon Chang-jung, a Blue House spokesman who was alleged by Washington police to have committed sexual assault against a young woman hired as an intern at the South Korean Embassy in Washington during President Park's first visit to the United States.[128]\\r\\nPark has been criticized for picking the wrong people for senior government posts.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nJust a week before the presidential election date, the opposing party alleged that the public servants from National Intelligence Service (NIS) have organized to promote Park's election campaign by way of posting online articles favorable to Park and slanderous to the opposing candidates.[citation needed] This political behavior by public servants is strictly prohibited by Korean Constitution.[130]\\r\\nTo prove their allegation, the opposing Democratic Party, along with the police and Central Election Assistance Commission, swooped in the house where the alleged agent of NIS has resided.[citation needed] From there, the 29-year-old female agent, later known as Ha-Young Kim, who was running an illegal online election campaign operation such as spreading slanderous postings about the opposing candidate had locked herself in.[citation needed] The police could not force to enter the house and the standoff lasted for three days, provoking a tense political standoff.[citation needed] The opposition accused the intelligence service of blocking an investigation.[citation needed] Park and her party accused the opposition of harassing the woman.[131] Park even said the standoff of the self-lock-in was a violation of a female right in the presidential candidate debate that took place three days before the election.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that night of the presidential debate, Kim Yong-pan, then the chief of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, publicly announced there was no evidence of illegal online postings from the collected laptop of the female agent.[citation needed] This announcement, which took place three days before the election, was believed to have significantly affected the outcome of the presidential election according to the opposing party.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter months of probes into the alleged election meddling, the prosecution concluded in mid-June 2013 that Won Sei-hoon, then NIS chief who headed the intelligence agency for around four years under former President Lee Myung-bak, ordered agents to conduct online smear campaign against opposition presidential candidates.[citation needed] The special investigation drew a conclusion that the agents systemically intervened in domestic politics by writing thousands of postings on politics in cyberspace through hundreds of different user IDs.[citation needed]  Kim Yong-pan, then chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency (SMPA), was prosecuted without physical detention on charges of abusing his authority to hamper police investigation into the case.[132] CCTV conversation between the computer analysts who were analyzing the laptop at police revealed that the police already knew there were illegal online postings against the opposing party's candidates, but the chief of SMPA publicly announced otherwise, an announcement that indicates intentional meddling into the presidential election.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe investigation and the trial at court are on-going, and Park faces a political blow.[citation needed] However, the leading Saenuri party along with government leaders has attempted to dodge its political fall-out.[citation needed] Their effort has involved tipping a rumor to a major conservative media, Chosun Ilbo, about an extramarital child of the Chae Dong-wook, former Prosecutor General, who has approved the prosecution of Won Se-hoon and Kim Yong-pan, which eventually led to his resignation.[133] Yoon Suk-ryul, the director of the special investigation team, which was leading the probe into the election meddling, was fired and returned to his original position, head of Yeoju branch Supreme Prosecutors Office. The investigation of his team has further revealed that the NIS is suspected of having posted 55,689 messages on Twitter for three months until the presidential election.[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether or not the election meddling of the NIS by way of online posts has actually affected the outcome of the presidential election is controversial.[citation needed] However, the false announcement by Kim Yong-pan, then chief of the SMPA, has appeared to do so.[citation needed] Had the police announced honestly, 14% of the electorate who voted for Park said they would have voted for Moon Jae-In, the first runner-up of the election.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark has been criticized for holding press conferences with questions and answers submitted in advance. As of 11 January 2015, she held press conferences four times since she took office in February 2013. Among the four press conferences, three of them were public speeches without questions and answers. Even in the remaining press conference, the questions were submitted in advance and she read prepared answers. Her opponents labeled her as \\"No communication\\" (??, Bultong).[136][137]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15 November 2015, around 80,000 anti-government protesters clashed with government forces on the streets of Seoul, demanding that Park step down, with many of the protesters chanting \\"Park Geun-hye, step down\\". The rally was triggered by Park's adopting business-friendly labour policies and a decision to require middle and high schools to use only state-issued history textbooks in classes starting in 2017,[138] combined with plans to make labour markets more flexible by giving employers more leeway in dismissing workers. Security forces fired tear gas and sprayed water cannons into the crowd when protesters attempted to break through police barricades.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of the April 2014 capsize of the Sewol ferry, public outcry arose over the government's handling of the situation.  In response, the Park administration established a commission to monitor and prosecute social media critics of Park.[140]\\r\\nTatsuya Kato, Japanese journalist who was a Seoul Bureau chief of South Korea at Sankei Shimbun was indicted on charges of defamation for reporting the relationship of President Park Geun-hye and Choi Soon-sil's husband, Chung Yoon-hoi,  by the Supreme Prosecutors' Office of the Republic of Korea after the MV Sewol sank.[141][142]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 June 2015 Park said that \\"Betrayal which breaks the trust shouldn't be accepted in politics and this should be punished by election with people's own hands\\". This mention was aimed to Yu Seungmin who was a member of Saenuri Party. Her mention was criticized by professor Jo Guk and politician Moon Jae-in because it had a purpose of losing Yu Seungmin's election which is protected by Public Official Election Act. But the National Election Commission decided not to treat Park's mention as a violation of Public Official Election Act.[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late October 2016, investigations into Park's relationship with Choi Soon-sil, daughter of the late Church of Eternal Life cult leader and President Park's mentor Choi Tae-min began.[144][145]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral news media including JTBC and the Hankyoreh reported that Choi, who has no official government position, had access to confidential documents and information for the president, and acted as a close confidant for the president. Choi and President Park's senior staffs including both Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung used their influence to extort ?77.4 billion (approximately $75 million) from Korean chaebolsfamily-owned large business conglomeratesand set up two culture and sports-related foundations, Mir and K-sports foundations.[146][147][148] Choi is also accused of having influenced Ewha Womans University to change their admission criteria in order for her daughter Chung Yoo-ra to be given a place there.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nAhn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung, top presidential aides, were arrested for abuse of power and helping Choi; they denied wrongdoing and claimed that they were simply following President Park's orders.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 October 2016, Park publicly acknowledged her close ties with Choi. On 28 October, Park dismissed key members of her top office staff while her approval ratings fell to 4%.[109] Her approval rating ranged from 1 to 3% for Korean citizens under 60 years of age, while it remained higher, at 13%, for the over 60 age group.[151] It was the worst ever approval rate in Korean history and is worse than the 6% approval rating of former President Kim Young-sam, who was widely blamed for forcing the Korean economy into the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[107][108][152] The controversy led to mass protests and rallies in October and November 2016 calling for her resignation.[153] On 12 November, more than 1 million citizens participated in the protests at Gwanghwamun Square close to presidential residence demanding President Park's resignation or impeachment.[154] On 19 November, another 1 million people participated in the national protest after Park refused to help in the investigation.[155][156]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark then fired a number of her cabinet members and the prime minister. In particular, the sacking of the prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn resulted in a controversy, due to the claim that his firing was carried out via a text message.[157][158]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Prosecutors' Office of Korea (SPO), in laying charges against Choi and two former presidential aides, have alleged that President Park colluded with the three in certain criminal activities. The president would be questioned by prosecutors, the first time this has occurred with a serving South Korean president.[159][160][161]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the scandal, there were a series of massive demonstrations that started in the first week of November 2016.[162]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 29 November 2016, Park offered to resign as President, and invited the National Assembly to arrange a transfer of power. The opposition parties rejected the offer, accusing Park of attempting to avoid the process of impeachment.[163]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Assembly instead filed a motion for impeachment, which was put to a vote on 9 December 2016[164] and passed with 234 supports.[165][166][167] Due to the ratification of her impeachment proposal, her presidential powers and duties were suspended, and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn assumed those powers and duties as Acting President.[5]\\r\\nPark was finally ousted from office by the Constitutional Court on 10 March 2017. The decision was unanimous, 8ÿ0 in favour of impeachment, as announced shortly thereafter.[168] On 26 March 2017, South Korean prosecutors announced they were seeking an arrest warrant against Park.[169] This warrant was granted by the Seoul Central District Court on 30 March 2017 and Park was arrested later that day.[170]\\r\\n\\r\\n?Impeached, but restored to office","input":"Who is the former president of south korea?"},{"output":"1963 until 1988","context":"Wild Kingdom, sometimes known as Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom, is an American television show that features wildlife and nature. It was originally produced from 1963 until 1988, and was revived in 2002. The show's second incarnation currently airs on Animal Planet in the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Wild Kingdom grew from discussions that started in 1962 between zoologist Marlin Perkins and V. J. Skutt, the chairman and CEO of insurance company Mutual of Omaha. The company had been the sponsor of an earlier animal-related show, Zoo Parade, that Perkins had hosted from 1952 until 1957. Also intimately involved with the creation of Wild Kingdom was Zoo Parade producer Don Meier, who was credited as the series' creator.[2] Mutual of Omaha sponsored and lent its name to the new program.\\r\\nWild Kingdom won Emmy Awards for \\"outstanding program achievement\\" in 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969. [3]\\r\\nLiz and Henk Maartens, from Irene, Pretoria in South Africa won five Emmy Awards for the documentary series Wild Kingdom in 1970. One Emmy Award was for camerawork while the other Emmy Awards were for aspects of production.[4]\\r\\nWild Kingdom was first broadcast by NBC. The half-hour show aired on Sundays starting January 6, 1963.[5] and continued until 1971, when the program entered first-run syndication. As a prime-time syndicated program, Wild Kingdom enjoyed great popularity. Although most of the programs aired after 1971 were repeats, new shows continued to be produced until 1987. Several episodes were filmed by cameraman Roy Pinney. Perkins was the host for most of the show's history until he was forced to retire in 1985 for health reasons and Jim Fowler, Perkins' long-time assistant and sidekick, became the host[6]. Perkins died of cancer three years later at age 83.\\r\\nOne of Wild Kingdom's film editors, Bernard Braham, A.C.E., was offered membership with the American Cinema Editors in 1979 and won a prestigious EDDIE award in Hollywood for best documentary of the year, for the episode \\"Desert Spring\\". His competition for the award was a National Geographic episode titled \\"Gold\\". He was also nominated for several other awards.[citation needed]\\r\\nPerkins often introduced commercial spots by tying them into the subject of the show. For example, at the end of a segment about lions, he might say something like, \\"Just as the mother lion protects her cubs, you can protect your children with an insurance policy from Mutual of Omaha...\\"\\r\\nThe format of the show often featured Perkins narrating off-camera, describing Fowler's on-camera work with the wild animals. This was commonly parodied as Perkins saying \\"I'll wait here [someplace safe] while Jim [does something or other with the dangerous animal]\\". However, according to a 1997 interview with Fowler, Perkins never said any such thing: according to Fowler, \\"Johnny Carson started the jokes about me and Marlin in his monologues\\".[7]\\r\\nPerkins often featured pet chimpanzees in the studio: one named \\"W.K.\\" (Wild Kingdom); the other named \\"Mr. Moke\\", after the Mini Moke vehicle.\\r\\nWild Kingdom increased ecological and environmental awareness in the United States. Its exciting footage brought the wilds of Africa, the Amazon River and other exotic locales into the living rooms of millions of Americans. It created an interest in commercial nature programming that was a precursor to cable television networks such as the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet.\\r\\nThe original series has not been seen since it went off the air. (Mutual of Omaha owns the rights to the series.) However, several episodes have now been released on DVD from BCI Eclipse (under license from Mutual of Omaha). Some episodes are also available on an official YouTube channel.[8]\\r\\nThe success of Wild Kingdom led to several other wildlife documentary series going on the air, including Animal World, Wild, Wild World of Animals. and Lorne Greene's New Wilderness. But many fans of wildlife documentaries still consider \\"Wild Kingdom\\" the \\"gold standard\\" against which other such shows are compared.[citation needed]\\r\\nA partial list of original episodes can be found here.\\r\\nThe show came under heavy criticism in the 1982 investigative piece \\"Cruel Camera\\" by The Fifth Estate, a news magazine program on Canada's CBC Television network, for staging scenes and for animal cruelty. Several interviewees who had worked on Wild Kingdom confirmed the rumors that many of the sequences were staged, such as in the episode where Perkins and crew captured a bear in the Florida swamps. In fact, the bear had actually been \\"placed\\" there by the production. Perkins denied such allegations on camera, and when interviewer Bob McKeown pressed him, said, ''I'd like you to stop your camera right now, please.''[9]\\r\\nIn 2002, a completely new Wild Kingdom, also sponsored by Mutual of Omaha, began airing new Wild Kingdom specials on Animal Planet.

The original boundaries protected an area of 35,528 acres (55.5?sq?mi).[6] A boundary change and redesignation as a national park and preserve was authorized on November 22, 2000 and then established by an act of Congress on September 24, 2004.[2] The park encompasses 107,342 acres (167.7?sq?mi) while the preserve protects an additional 41,686 acres (65.1?sq?mi) for a total of 149,028 acres (232.9?sq?mi).[1]\\r\\nThe park contains the tallest sand dunes in North America.[7] The dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) and are estimated to contain over 5 billion cubic meters of sand.[8] Sediments from the surrounding mountains filled the valley over geologic time periods. After lakes within the valley receded, exposed sand was blown by the predominant southwest winds toward the Sangre de Cristos, eventually forming the dunefield over an estimated tens of thousands of years.[9] The four primary components of the Great Sand Dunes system are the mountain watershed, the dunefield, the sand sheet, and the sabkha.[8] Ecosystems within the mountain watershed include alpine tundra, subalpine forests, montane woodlands, and riparian zones.[10]\\r\\nEvidence of human habitation in the San Luis Valley dates back about 11,000 years. The first historic peoples to inhabit the area were the Southern Ute Tribe, while Apaches and Navajo also have cultural connections in the dunes area. In the late 17th century, Don Diego de Vargasa Spanish governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mxicobecame the first European on record to enter the San Luis Valley. Juan Bautista de Anza, Zebulon Pike, John C. Frmont, and John Gunnison all travelled through and explored parts of the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. The explorers were soon followed by settlers who ranched, farmed and mined in the valley starting in the late 19th century. The park was first established as a national monument in 1932 to protect it from gold mining and the potential of a concrete manufacturing business.[11]\\r\\nVisitors must walk across the wide and shallow Medano Creek to reach the dunes in spring and summer months. The creek typically has a peak flow from late May to early June in most years. From July through April, the creek is usually no more than a few inches deep, if there is any water at all.[12] Hiking is permitted throughout the dunes with the warning that the sand surface temperature may reach 150?F (66?C) in summer.[13] Sandboarding and sandsledding are popular activities, both done on specially designed equipment which can be rented just outside the park entrance or in Alamosa.[14] Visitors with street-legal four-wheel drive vehicles may continue past the end of the park's main road to Medano Pass on 22 miles (35?km) of unpaved road, crossing the stream bed of Medano Creek nine times and traversing 4 miles (6.4?km) of deep sand.[15] Hunting is permitted in the preserve during the months of autumn, while hunting is prohibited within national park boundaries at all times.[16] The preserve encompasses nearly all of the mountainous areas north and east of the dunefield, up to the ridgeline of the Sangre de Cristos.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area dates back about 11,000 years. Some of the first people to enter the San Luis Valley and the Great Sand Dunes area were nomadic hunter-gatherers whose connection to the area centered around the herds of mammoths and prehistoric bison. They were Stone Age people who hunted with large stone spear or dart points now identified as Clovis and Folsom points. These people only stayed when hunting and plant gathering was good, and avoided the region during times of drought and scarcity.[11]\\r\\nModern American Indian tribes were familiar with the area when Spaniards first arrived in the 17th century. The traditional Ute phrase for the Great Sand Dunes is Saa waap maa nache, \\"sand that moves.\\" Jicarilla Apaches settled in northern New Mexico and called the dunes Sei-anyedi, \\"it goes up and down.\\" Blanca Peak, just southeast of the dunes, is one of the four sacred mountains of the Navajo, who call it Sisnaajini. These various tribes collected the inner layers of bark from ponderosa pine trees for use as food and medicine. The people from the Tewa/Tiwa-speaking pueblos along the Rio Grande remember a traditional site of great importance located in the valley near the dunes: the lake through which their people emerged into the present world. They call the lake Sip'ophe, meaning \\"Sandy Place Lake\\", which is thought to be the springs and/or lakes immediately west of the dunefield.[11]\\r\\nIn 1694, Don Diego de Vargas became the first European known to have entered the San Luis Valley, although herders and hunters from the Spanish colonies in present-day northern New Mexico probably entered the valley as early as 1598. De Vargas and his men hunted a herd of 500 bison in the southern part of the valley before returning to Santa Fe. In 1776, Juan Bautista de Anza and an entourage of men and livestock probably passed near the dunes as they returned from a punitive raid against a group of Comanches. At this time, the valley was a travel route between the High Plains and Santa Fe for Comanches, Utes, and Spanish soldiers. The dunes were likely a visible landmark for travelers along the trail.[11]\\r\\nThe first known writings about Great Sand Dunes appear in Zebulon Pikes journals of 1807. As Lewis and Clarks expedition was returning east, U.S. Army Lt. Pike was commissioned to explore as far west as the Arkansas and Red Rivers. By the end of November 1806, Pike and his men had reached the site of todays Pueblo, Colorado. Still pushing southwest, and confused about the location of the Arkansas River, Pike crossed the Sangre de Cristos just above the Great Sand Dunes.[11]\\r\\nAfter marching some miles, we discovered ... at the foot of the White Mountains [todays Sangre de Cristos] which we were then descending, sandy hillsWhen we encamped, I ascended one of the largest hills of sand, and with my glass could discover a large river [the Rio Grande] The sand-hills extended up and down the foot of the White Mountains about 15 miles, and appeared to be about 5 miles in width. Their appearance was exactly that of the sea in a storm, except as to color, not the least sign of vegetation existing thereon.\\r\\nIn 1848, John C. Frmont was hired to find a railroad route from St. Louis to California. He crossed the Sangre de Cristos into the San Luis Valley in winter, courting disaster but proving that a winter crossing of this range was possible. He was followed in 1853 by Captain John Gunnison of the Corps of Topographical Engineers. Gunnisons party crossed the dunefield on horseback.[11]\\r\\nIn the years that followed, the Rockies were gradually explored, treaties were signed and broken with resident tribes, and people with widely differing goals entered the San Luis Valley from the United States and Mexico. In 1852, Fort Massachusetts was built and then relocated to Fort Garland, about 20 miles southeast of the Great Sand Dunes, to safeguard travel for settlers following the explorers into the valley. Although many settlers arrived via the trails from Santa Fe or La Veta Pass, several routes over the Sangre de Cristos into the valley were well-known to American Indians and increasingly used by settlers in the late 1800s. Medano Pass, also known as Sand Hill Pass, and Mosca Pass, also called Robidouxs Pass, offered more direct routes from the growing front range cities and dropped into the valley just east of the Great Sand Dunes. Trails were improved into wagon routes and eventually into rough roads. The Mosca Pass Toll Road was developed in the 1870s, and stages and the mail route used it regularly through about 1911 when the western portion was damaged in a flash flood. Partially rebuilt at times in the 1930s through the 1950s, the road was repeatedly closed due to flood damage and is now a hiking trail.[11]\\r\\nThe Herard familyafter whom Mount Herard is named[17]established a ranch and homestead along Medano Creek in 1875, using the old Medano Pass Road to travel to and from their home. The modern unpaved road follows the old route and is open only to four-wheel drive, high-clearance vehicles as it passes through deep sand, rises to Medano Pass, and continues east into the Wet Mountain Valley. The Herards grazed and bred cattle in the mountain meadows, raised horses, and established a trout hatchery in the stream. Other families homesteaded near the dunes as well, including the Teofilo Trujillo family whose sheep and cattle ranch in the valley later became part of the MedanoÿZapata Ranch, owned by the Nature Conservancy since 1999. The Trujillo's extant homestead and the ruins of a destroyed one were declared a National Historic Landmark in 2004.[18] Frank and Virginia Wellington built a cabin and hand-dug the irrigation ditch that parallels Wellington Ditch Trail located south of the park campground.[11]\\r\\nGold and silver rushes occurred around the Rockies after 1853, bringing miners by the thousands into the state and stimulating mining businesses that are still in operation. Numerous small strikes occurred in the mountains around the San Luis Valley. People had frequently speculated that gold might be present in the Great Sand Dunes, and local newspapers ran articles in the 1920s estimating its worth at anywhere from 17 cents/ton to $3/ton. Active placer mining operations sprang up along Medano Creek, and in 1932 the Volcanic Mining Company established a gold mill designed to recover gold from the sand. Although minute quantities of gold were recovered, the technique was too labor-intensive, the stream too seasonal, and the pay-out too small to support any business for long.[11]\\r\\nThe idea that the dunes could be destroyed by gold mining or concrete manufacturing alarmed residents of Alamosa and Monte Vista. By the 1920s, the dunes had become a source of pride for local people, and a potential source of tourist dollars for local businesses. Members of the P.E.O. Sisterhood sponsored a bill to Congress asking for national monument status for Great Sand Dunes. Widely supported by local people, the bill was signed into law in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover. Similar support in the late 1990s resulted in the monuments expansion into a national park and preserve in 2000-2004.[11]\\r\\nThe park contains the tallest sand dunes in North America,[7] rising to a maximum height of 750 feet (229?m)[4] from the floor of the San Luis Valley on the western base of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) and are estimated to contain over 5 billion cubic meters of sand.[8]\\r\\nCreation of the San Luis Valley began when the Sangre de Cristo Range was uplifted in the rotation of a large tectonic plate. The San Juan Mountains to the west of the valley were created through extended and dramatic volcanic activity. The San Luis Valley encompasses the area between the two mountain ranges and is roughly the size of the state of Connecticut. Sediments from both mountain ranges filled the deep chasm of the valley, along with huge amounts of water from melting glaciers and rain. The presence of larger rocks along Medano Creek at the base of the dunes, elsewhere on the valley floor, and in buried deposits indicates that some of the sediment has been washed down in torrential flash floods.[9]\\r\\nIn 2002, geologists discovered lakebed deposits on hills in the southern part of the valley, confirming theories of a huge lake that once covered much of the San Luis Valley floor. The body of water was named Lake Alamosa after the largest town in the valley. Lake Alamosa suddenly receded after its extreme water pressure broke through volcanic deposits in the southern end of the valley. The water then drained through the Rio Grande, likely forming the steep Rio Grande Gorge near Taos, New Mexico. Smaller lakes still covered the valley floor, including two broad lakes in the northeastern side of the valley. Large amounts of sediment from the volcanic San Juan Mountains continued to wash down into these lakes, along with some sand from the Sangre de Cristo Range. Dramatic natural climate change later significantly reduced these lakes, leaving behind the sand sheet. Remnants of these lakes still exist in the form of sabkha wetlands.[9]\\r\\nSand that was left behind after the lakes receded blew with the predominant southwest winds toward a low curve in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The wind funnels toward three mountain passesMosca, Medano, and Music Passesand the sand accumulates in this natural pocket. The winds blow from the valley floor toward the mountains, but during storms the winds blow back toward the valley. These opposing wind directions cause the dunes to grow vertically. Two mountain streamsMedano and Sand Creeksalso capture sand from the mountain side of the dunefield and carry it around the dunes and back to the valley floor. The creeks then disappear into the sand sheet, and the sand blows back into the dunefield. Barchan and transverse dunes form near these creeks. The combination of opposing winds, a huge supply of sand from the valley floor, and the sand recycling action of the creeks, are all part of the reason that these are the tallest dunes in North America.[9]\\r\\nSufficient vegetation has grown on the valley floor that there is little sand blowing into the main dunefield from the valley; however, small parabolic dunes continue to originate in the sand sheet and migrate across grasslands, joining the main dunefield. Some of these migrating dunes become covered by grasses and shrubs and stop migrating. The dunes system is fairly stable as the opposing wind directions balance each other out over time. Also, the main dunefield is moist beneath a thin layer of dry surface sand. While the top few inches of sand are blown around during windstorms, the moist sand remains largely in place.[9]\\r\\nScientists estimate that Lake Alamosa disappeared about 440,000 years ago, but the dunes themselves apparently originate from sand deposits from later, smaller lakes. A relatively new dating process, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is still in development. This method takes core samples of sand from deep within a dune, and attempts to measure how long quartz grains have been buried in the dark. If the deepest sand deposits can be accurately dated, the age of the dunes could be determined. Samples of sand from deep in the dunes have returned OSL dates varying between a few hundred years to tens of thousands of years old. The oldest dated deposits found so far would have accumulated in the late Pleistocene epoch, during the middle years of the current ice age's third stage.[9]\\r\\nThe dunes contain dark areas which are deposits of magnetite, a mineral that has eroded out of the Sangre de Cristo Range. Magnetite is both attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a magnet itself; it is the most magnetic mineral in nature.[19] Magnetite is an oxide of iron which is heavier than the surrounding particles of sand. When overlying sand is removed by wind, magnetite deposits stay in place and are visible as dark patches in the dunefield.[20]\\r\\nGreat Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is located in Saguache and Alamosa Counties, Colorado at approximately 37.75 north latitude and 105.5 west longitude. The national park is located in the San Luis Valley while the national preserve is located to the east in an adjacent section of the Sangre de Cristo Range of the Rocky Mountains.[5] Elevations range from 7,515?ft (2,291?m) in the valley west of the dunes, to 13,604?ft (4,146?m) at the summit of Tijeras Peak in the northern part of the preserve.[21][10]\\r\\nThe dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) while the surrounding relatively flat sand sheet which feeds the large dunes is actually the largest component of the entire dunes system, containing about 90% of all the sand in the park.[8] The forested and often snowcapped mountains exceeding 13,000?ft (4,000?m) to the east are the most prominent feature, towering over the high dunes. Other features include snow-fed creeks originating high in the mountains, and several alpine lakes. Two spring-fed creeks in the sand sheet along with a few small lakes in the valley's sabkha section southwest of the dunes create a wetland that nurtures wildlife.[10]\\r\\nThe main dunefield measures roughly 4?mi (6.4?km) east-to-west and 6?mi (9.7?km) north-to-south, with an adjacent 6?sq?mi (16?km2) area to the northwest called the Star Dune Complex, for a total of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2). The park and preserve together are approximately 15?mi (24?km) east-to-west at the widest point, and approximately 15?mi (24?km) north-to-south, also at the widest point.[5] The park encompasses 107,342 acres (167.7?sq?mi), while the preserve protects an additional 41,686 acres (65.1?sq?mi) for a total of 149,028 acres (232.9?sq?mi).[1]\\r\\nThe Rio Grande National Forest is located to the north and southeast while the remaining forested slopes directly to the east of the dunes were redesignated the Great Sand Dunes National Preserve. The San Isabel National Forest is located to the east of the preserve just beyond the ridge of the Sangre de Cristo Range. Private property abuts most of the southern boundary of the park. The San Luis Lakes State Wildlife Area lies adjacent to the southwestern corner of the park, while the Rio Grande flows through the valley farther to the southwest. The Baca National Wildlife Refuge lies adjacent to the west, and the slopes of the San Juan Mountains begin at the western edge of the valley. Private property of the Baca Grande subdivision of Crestone lies adjacent to the northwest.[5]\\r\\nThe nearest city is Alamosa which is about 30?mi (48?km) away by road to the southwest.[22][23] The nearest towns are Crestone to the north, Mosca and Hooper to the west, Blanca and Fort Garland to the south, and Gardner to the east. Colorado Springs and Denver are located a few hours away by car to the northeast.[23] The major roads through the San Luis Valley are U.S. Route 160 on an eastÿwest alignment passing south of the park, and U.S. Route 285 on a northÿsouth alignment passing west of the park and generally parallel to Colorado State Highway 17, which is the closer of the two northÿsouth roadways.[23]\\r\\nThe Great Sand Dunes are located in the high elevation desert of the San Luis Valley, just west of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The summer high temperatures are atypical for a desert area as the average high temperature is only slightly above 80?F (27?C) in the warmest month of July; however, the large spread between high and low temperatures is typical of a high desert climate. Low temperatures during winter nights can be extremely cold, with average low temperatures well below 32?F (0?C) and record low temperatures below 0?F (?18?C) from November through April.[24] Precipitation is very low on the dunes, averaging just 11.13 inches (283?mm) of rainfall per year.[25] The high evaporation rates on the dunes qualify the area as a desert, even though precipitation exceeds 10 inches (250?mm).\\r\\nSpring can sometimes bring high winds, mainly in the afternoon. Spring conditions vary greatly, from mild and sunny to cold and snowy. March is the snowiest month of the year, though some days are above 50?F (10?C). In late spring, when Medano Creek usually has its peak flow, snow or high winds are still possible. In summer, daytime high temperatures average 75ÿ80?F (24ÿ27?C); however, sand surface temperatures can soar to 150?F (66?C) on sunny afternoons. Summer nights are coolthe park is located 8,200?ft (2,500?m) above sea levelwith nighttime temperatures often dropping below 50?F (10?C). Afternoon thundershowers are common in July and August with cool winds, heavy rain and lightning. Fall is generally mild, with Indian summer days when temperatures reach 60?F (16?C) and higher, but chilly nights below freezing. Occasional fall storms bring icy rain or snow. Cold temperatures well below freezing are typical in winter, although the sunshine is generally abundant and the dry air doesn't feel as cold as more humid areas. The average winter high temperatures are just above freezing even in January, which is the coldest month of the year.[26]\\r\\nThe four primary components of the Great Sand Dunes system are the mountain watershed, the dunefield, the sand sheet, and the sabkha. The mountain watershed receives heavy snow and rain which feeds creeks that flow down from alpine tundra and lakes, through subalpine and montane woodlands, and finally around the main dunefield. Sand that has blown from the valley floor is captured in streams and carried back toward the valley. As creeks disappear into the valley floor, the sand is picked up and carried to the dunefield once again. The recycling action of water and wind, along with a 7% moisture content below the dry surface holding the sand together, contributes to the great height of the dunes.[8]\\r\\nThe dunefield is composed of reversing dunes, transverse dunesalso called crescentic or barchan dunesand star dunes. The sand sheet is the largest component of the system, comprising sandy grasslands that extend around three sides of the dunefield. Almost 90% of the sand deposit is found in the sand sheet, while the remainder is found in the dunefield. Small parabolic dunes form in the sand sheet and then migrate into the main dunefield. Nabkha dunes form around vegetation. The sabkha forms where sand is seasonally saturated by rising ground water. When the water evaporates away in late summer, minerals similar to baking soda cement sand grains together into a hard, white crust. Areas of sabkha can be found throughout western portions of the sand sheet, wherever the water table meets the surface. Some wetlands in the sabkha are deeper with plentiful plants and animals, while others are shallow and salty.[8]\\r\\nThere are hundreds of plant species in the park and preserve, adapted for environments as diverse as alpine tundra and warm water wetlands. Trees include aspen, Douglas fir, pinyon pine, ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, three-leaf sumac, bristlecone pine, red osier dogwood, and narrow-leaf cottonwood.[27][28]\\r\\nAmong the flowering plants are alpine phlox, dwarf clover, alpine forget-me-not, fairy primrose, alpine aven, Indian paintbrush, lousewort, blue-purple penstemon, aspen daisy, western paintbrush, elephantella, snow buttercups, scurfpea, Indian ricegrass, blowout grass, prairie sunflower, Rocky Mountain beeplant, rubber rabbitbrush, speargrass, small-flowered sand verbena, narrowleaf yucca, prickly pear cactus, Rocky Mountain iris, and white water buttercup.[27][28]\\r\\nInland saltgrass is the primary type of grass around sabkha wetlands in the park.[27]\\r\\nMammals includefrom alpine tundra to low elevation grasslandsthe pika, yellow-bellied marmot, bighorn sheep, black bear, snowshoe hare, Abert's squirrel, cougar, mule deer, water shrew, beaver, kangaroo rat, badger, pronghorn, and elk. Over 1500 bison are currently ranched within park boundaries on private land owned by The Nature Conservancy which is only open to the public through tours.[29]\\r\\nOver 200 species of birds are found throughout the park. From higher to lower elevations and dependent on season, some of the bird species include the brown-capped rosy finch, white-tailed ptarmigan, red-breasted nuthatch, peregrine falcon, mountain bluebird, northern pygmy owl, dusky grouse, hummingbird (four species), western tanager, burrowing owl, bald eagle, golden eagle, sandhill crane, American avocet, and great blue heron.[30]\\r\\nVarious reptiles live in the park, such as the short-horned lizard, fence lizard, many-lined skink, bullsnake, and garter snake.[31]\\r\\nFish living in the park's streams include the Rio Grande cutthroat trout, Rio Grande sucker (Catostomus plebeius), and fathead minnow.[32]\\r\\nAmphibians include the tiger salamander, chorus frog, northern leopard frog, spadefoot toad, Great Plains toad, and Woodhouse's toad.[33]\\r\\nThe park harbors several endemic insects including the Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle, a circus beetle (Eleodes hirtipennis), Werner's (Amblyderus werneri) and Triplehorn's (Amblyderus triplehorni) ant-like flower beetle, as well as undescribed species of clown beetle, noctuid moth, and robber fly. More than a thousand different kinds of arthropods have been found at the Great Sand Dunes.[34]\\r\\nAlpine tundra is the highest elevation ecosystem at Great Sand Dunes where the conditions are too harsh for trees to survive, but wildflowers, pikas, yellow-bellied marmots, ptarmigans, and bighorn sheep thrive. The tundra begins about 11,700?ft (3,600?m) and continues upward to the highest peaks in the park. At subalpine elevations near the tree line grow krummholz (meaning \\"crooked wood\\")trees which are stunted and twisted due to high winds, snow, ice, short growing seasons, and shallow, poorly developed soils. The transition zone between subalpine forest and alpine tundra is an important refuge during storms for some mammals and birds who primarily live on tundra. Bristlecone and limber pines grow at an extremely slow rate, with small statures that belie their true ages as some are more than a thousand years old.[10]\\r\\nSubalpine forests and meadows capture heavy snow in winter and soaking rains in summer. The highest diversity of Rocky Mountain species of plants and animals are found in this ecosystem. Subalpine forest extends from 9,500?ft (2,900?m) to tree line at 11,700?ft (3,600?m). Montane forests and woodlands are found along the drier foothills at approximately 8,000?ft (2,400?m) to 9,500?ft (2,900?m). Pinyon-juniper and ponderosa pine woodlands are found on open, drier slopes, while cottonwood and aspen trees are in drainages. Cougars hunt mule deer here at night. Owls, dusky grouse, turkeys, and bullsnakes all find habitat in these drier, open woodlands.[10]\\r\\nThe riparian zone follows creeks through the subalpine and montane ecosystems at Great Sand Dunes. Cottonwood and aspen trees, red osier dogwood, and alder grow well in this wet environment, in turn providing shade and habitat for black bears, water shrews, and western tanagers. Rio Grande cutthroat trout are found in Medano Creek.[10]\\r\\nWhile the top few inches of the dunefield are often dry, the dunes are moist year-round due to ongoing precipitation. Moisture content of 7% beneath the surface sand allows species such as Ord's kangaroo rat, Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle, scurfpea, and blowout grass to survive here. Many animals visit the dunes from other habitats, including elk, pronghorn, bison, coyotes, bobcats, and raptors.[10]\\r\\nThe sand sheet includes extensive grasslands and shrublands that surround the dunefield on three sides, from 7,500?ft (2,300?m) to 8,200?ft (2,500?m). The sand sheet varies from wet meadows to cool-grass prairie to desert shrubland, depending on proximity to groundwater and soil type. Elk and pronghorn are common, while burrowing owls nest in the ground and other raptors float through the skies searching for mice, kangaroo rats, and short-horned lizards.[10]\\r\\nThe sabkha is a wetland region where groundwater rises and falls seasonally, leaving white alkali deposits on the surface. Inland saltgrass is common in this area. Toads can reproduce in sabkha wetlands when they are seasonally filled with sufficient fresh water. Shore birds such as the American avocet hunt tadpoles and insects in the shallow water. Wetlands speckle the San Luis Valley and are important habitat for sandhill cranes, shore birds, amphibians, dragonflies, and freshwater shrimp. Grassland species such as elk also use these waters for drinking. The sabkha and wetlands are at approximately 7,500?ft (2,300?m) in elevation.[10]\\r\\nThe park preserves the tallest sand dunes in North America,[7] as well as alpine lakes and tundra, mountain peaks over 13,000 feet (3,962 m) in elevation, mixed conifer forests, grasslands, and wetlands.[35]\\r\\nMedano Creek, which borders the east side of the dunes, never finds a permanent and stable streambed as fresh sand falls in the creek. Small underwater sand ridges that act like dams form and break down, creating surges of water which resemble waves. The surges occur at an average interval of about 20 seconds. In a high-water year, the surges can be as high as 20?in (51?cm). The \\"surge flow\\" mainly occurs during the peak flow period from late May to early June in most years.[12]\\r\\nBig Spring Creek is a unique spring-fed creek formed by an unconfined aquifer which creates wetlands that support rare species and plant communities in a generally arid area. The creek was designated a National Natural Landmark in 2012.[36]\\r\\nAccessing the dunes requires walking across the wide and shallow Medano Creek. The creek typically flows past the main dunes parking area from late April through late June, with peak flow occurring from late May to early June in most years. In other months, the creek is usually only a few inches deep, if there is any water at all.[12] Hiking is permitted throughout the dunes, with the warning that the sand can get very hot in the summer, up to 150?F (66?C).[13] Sand wheelchairs are available at the visitor center.[37] Sandboards and sand sleds can be rented just outside the park entrance or in Alamosa which is the closest city.[14]\\r\\nMosca Pass Trail is a 7?mi (11?km) roundtrip hike that follows a small creek through aspen and evergreen forests to Mosca Passelevation 9,737?ft (2,968?m)[5]in the Sangre de Cristo Range. American Indians and early settlers used this route for travel between the San Luis Valley and the Wet Mountain Valley to the east. Several trails located in the northeastern section of the park lead to alpine lakes high in the mountains. A trail to Medano Lake and the summit of Mount Herard is located off Medano Pass Road. A trail along Sand Creek leads to the Sand Creek Lakes and Music Passelevation 11,380?ft (3,470?m)[5]with a view of the Upper Sand Creek basin. Spur trails along Sand Creek lead to the four alpine lakes which feed the creek, and to several 13,000?ft (4,000?m) peaks above the basin. The Sand Ramp Trail traverses between the dunefield and the mountains, connecting the park's campground to Medano Pass Road (follow the road up to Medano Lake and Pass), as well as the base of the Sand Creek Trail.[13][5] Most of the park's grasslands, shrublands and wetlands have no established trails but are generally open to hiking. The Nature Conservancy's Medano Ranch property may only be visited on a guided tour. A fence surrounds the property to contain the Conservancy's bison herd and demarcate the boundaries.[38]\\r\\nMedano Pass Road is a 22?mi (35?km) four-wheel drive (4WD) road that begins where the main park road ends.[39] The unpaved road crosses Medano Creek nine times and traverses 4?mi (6.4?km) of deep sand. Only street-licensed 4WD motor vehicles or motorcycles, and bicycles are permitted.[15] Fat tire bikes are the only type of bicycle recommended by the park service due to the deep sandy stretches.[40] The road winds around the eastern side of the dunefield, up through a forested mountain canyon inside the National Preserve, and then over Medano Passelevation 9,982?ft (3,043?m)[5]at the 11.2?mi (18.0?km) mark. The road then continues down into the Wet Mountain Valley and connects with Colorado State Highway 69. Travellers are advised that hunting is permitted in the National Preserve during the months of autumn.[15]\\r\\nMost of the national park and the entire national preserve are open to horseback riding and pack animals. Prohibited zones include all developed areassuch as the Pinyon Flats campground, picnic areas, and the visitor centerall paved roadways and many of the hiking trails, along with the dunes area from the parking lot to as far as the High Dune, which is for pedestrian use only. All national park horse camping areas are in the wilderness in designated backcountry campsites or other wilderness areas at least 0.25?mi (0.4?km) from roads or trails. Camping is permitted anywhere in the national preserve and at designated sites along the Medano Pass Road, as long as minimum impact guidelines are followed. Permitted pack animals in the national park and the preserve include horses, mules, burros, donkeys, alpacas, and llamas. Overnight guests at the Zapata Ranch may take guided trips into the park; Zapata Partners is the only NPS-licensed provider of horseback riding in the Great Sand Dunes.[41][42]\\r\\nUnlike all other national parks in the contiguous United States, Great Sand Dunes National Park is located directly adjacent to a national preserve. The preserve is also managed by the National Park Service and seasonal hunting is permitted there.[16] Sport hunting has regulations which include not pursuing a wounded animal if it leaves the preserve and enters the national park. Mountain lion hunting with dogs is also allowed in the preserve, but unless the dogs have spotted the lion and are pursuing it, they are required to be leashed.[43] Other game species include turkey, bear, bighorn sheep, elk and mule deer.[44]\\r\\nThe dunes and surrounding area were designated a national monument in 1932 after a billsponsored by the P.E.O. Sisterhood and widely supported by local residentswas signed into law by President Herbert Hoover. Similar support in the late 1990s resulted in the monuments redesignation as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in 2000-2004.[11] The original boundaries protected an area of 35,528 acres (55.5?sq?mi).[6]\\r\\nIn 1976, the U.S. Congress designated the Great Sand Dunes Wildernessa wilderness area encompassing 32,643 acres (51?sq?mi) within the monument. This wilderness is the only one in the U.S. that protects a saltbush-greasewood ecosystem and includes the entire dunefield as well as much of the area west of the dunes.[45][46] Congress also designated the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness in 1993, which contains a total of 219,776 acres (343.4?sq?mi) of mountainous terrain.[47] Most of the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness is managed by the U.S. Forest Service while the National Park Service manages the area that has since been designated a national preserve.[48] Mechanized transport and motorized equipment or vehicles are not permitted in wilderness areas, while ATVs are not permitted anywhere in the national park and preserve.[47] The restrictions of a wilderness designation protect native wildlife such as the endemic Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle from potential extinction caused by human activities.[49] Both of the wilderness area designations exclude the existing road corridors that pass through them, specifically the paved park road and the unpaved Medano Pass Road.[46]\\r\\nIn 1999, the Nature Conservancy purchased surrounding state-owned land.[50] The land is within the MedanoÿZapata Ranch, located to the west and south.[51] Some of the ranch land is located within the current national park boundary in its southwestern corner,[5] and includes a fenced area that contains a bison herd within 44,000 acres (68.8?sq?mi)[50]an area that can only be visited on a guided tour.[52][53] The objective of the Nature Conservancy, as well as the federal and state governments, is to combine conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem, in a manner similar to the protected area mosaic recommended in the early 1980s for parts of the Yukon in Canada.[51]\\r\\nThe eventual redesignation as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve was authorized on November 22, 2000 when President Bill Clinton signed the Congressionally-approved Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve Act. The act directed the Secretary of the Interior to \\"establish the Great Sand Dunes National Park when sufficient land having sufficient diversity of resources has been acquired to warrant its designation.\\"[54] The new designation as a national park and preserve would not be made official until 2004 after sufficient land had been acquired.[55][56]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Nature Conservancy purchased the Baca Ranchan area of 97,000 acres (151.6?sq?mi)for $31.28 million. Financing was provided by the Department of the Interior, the Colorado State Land Board and private donors. The Baca Ranch had property located in the valley and the adjacent mountains, ranging in elevation from 7,500?ft (2,286?m) west of the dunes to the 14,165?ft (4,317?m) summit of Kit Carson Peak. The purchase approximately tripled the size of the monument. The ranch was split into three sections: the Sangre de Cristos section east of Crestone became part of the Rio Grande National Forest; the section west of the dunes was designated the Baca National Wildlife Refuge and managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service; the section east of the dunes was transferred first to the Rio Grande National Forest and later redesignated a national preserve in 2004 managed by the National Park Service. The national preserve remains open to regulated seasonal hunting, as it was when designated national forest land, but is protected from logging and mining activities which are generally permitted in national forests.[57]\\r\\nThe boundaries of the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve were established by an act of Congress on September 24, 2004.[2]\\r\\nIn 2016, the federal government began negotiations toward purchasing 12,518 acres (19.6?sq?mi) of the MedanoÿZapata Ranch from the Nature Conservancy. The plan is to complete the park, making it fully accessible to the public, by acquiring the final piece of privately-held land located within the current park boundaries. The land includes the area presently occupied by the bison herd, as well as adjacent meadows and wetland areas. The purchase is expected to be completed by 2018.[56]","input":"What city are the sand dunes in colorado?"},{"output":"Dustin Johnson","context":"The following is a list of golfers who have been top of the Official World Golf Ranking.

Snowy owls are native to Arctic regions in North America and Eurasia. Males are almost all white, while females have more flecks of black plumage. Juvenile snowy owls have black feathers until they turn white. The snowy owl is a ground nester that primarily hunts rodents and waterfowl, and opportunistically eats carrion. Most owls sleep during the day and hunt at night, but the snowy owl is active during the day, especially in the summertime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snowy owl was one of the many bird species originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name of Strix scandiaca.[2] The genus name Bubo is Latin for the Eurasian eagle-owl and scandiaca is New Latin for Scandinavia.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil recently, the snowy owl was regarded as the sole member of a distinct genus, as Nyctea scandiaca, but mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data (Olsen et al. 2002) shows that it is very closely related to the horned owls in the genus Bubo. However, some authorities debate this classification, still preferring Nyctea.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis yellow-eyed, black-beaked white bird is easily recognisable. It is 52ÿ71?cm (20ÿ28?in) long, with a 125ÿ150?cm (49ÿ59?in) wingspan. Also, these owls can weigh anywhere from 1.6 to 3?kg (3.5 to 6.6?lb). The average lifespan in the wild is ten years.[5] It is one of the largest species of owl and, in North America, is on average the heaviest owl species. The adult male is virtually pure white, but females and young birds have some dark spots; the young are heavily barred, and dark spotting may even predominate. Its thick plumage, heavily feathered taloned feet, and colouration render the snowy owl well-adapted for life north of the Arctic Circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnowy owl calls are varied, but the alarm call is a barking, almost quacking krek-krek; the female also has a softer mewling pyee-pyee or prek-prek. The song is a deep repeated gahw. They may also clap their beak in response to threats or annoyances. While called clapping, it is believed this sound may actually be a clicking of the tongue, not the beak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snowy owl is typically found in the northern circumpolar region, where it makes its summer home north of latitude 60 north. However, it is a particularly nomadic bird, and because population fluctuations in its prey species can force it to relocate, it has been known to breed at more southerly latitudes. During the last glacial period, there was a Central European subspecies, Bubo scandiacus gallicus, but no modern subspecies are recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnowy owls nest in the Arctic tundra of the northernmost stretches of Alaska, Northern Canada, and Eurasia. They winter south through Canada and northern Eurasia, with irruptions occurring further south in some years. Snowy owls are attracted to open areas like coastal dunes and prairies that appear somewhat similar to tundra. During irruption years when they are found in the Northeastern US, juveniles frequent developed areas, as well as the expected grassland/agricultural areas that older birds primarily utilize. All ages spend a fair amount of their time over water in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Ocean, mostly on ice floes.[6] They have been reported as far south as the American Gulf Coast states, Hawaii, southernmost Russia, and northern China.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Late Pleistocene the range expanded southward to Bulgaria (80,000ÿ16,000 years, Kozarnika Cave, W Bulgaria),[7] and much of the Italian Peninsula.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1886, a snowy owl landed on the rigging of the Nova Scotia steamship Ulunda on the edge of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, over 600?km (370?mi) from the nearest land. It was captured and later preserved at the Nova Scotia Museum.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1967 and 1975, snowy owls bred on the remote island of Fetlar in the Shetland Isles north of Scotland. Females summered as recently as 1993, but their status in the British Isles is now that of a rare winter visitor to Shetland, the Outer Hebrides and the Cairngorms.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2009, a snowy owl appeared in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the first reported sighting in the state since 1987.[11] Also notable is the mass southern migration in the winter of 2011/2012, when thousands of snowy owls were spotted in various locations across the United States.[12] This was then followed by an even larger mass southern migration in 2013/2014 with the first snowy owls seen in Florida for decades.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen perched Snowy owls often face the sun, which has been suggested to represent a visual display across long distances in open habitats. However, snowy owls appear to orient themselves into the sun or wind depending on prevailing weather conditions, therefore it is likely that wind and sun-orientating are associated with thermoregulation.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis species of owl nests on the ground, building a scrape on top of a mound or boulder. A site with good visibility is chosen, such as the top of a mound with ready access to hunting areas and a lack of snow. Gravel bars and abandoned eagle nests may be used. The female scrapes a small hollow before laying the eggs. Breeding occurs in May to June, and depending on the amount of prey available, clutch sizes range from 3 to 11 eggs, which are laid singly, approximately every other day over the course of several days. Hatching takes place approximately five weeks after laying, and the pure white young are cared for by both parents. Although the young hatch asynchronously, with the largest in the brood sometimes 10 to 15 times as heavy as the smallest, there is little sibling conflict and no evidence of siblicide. Both the male and the female defend the nest and their young from predators, sometimes by distraction displays. Males may mate with two females that may nest about a kilometre apart.[16] Some individuals stay on the breeding grounds while others migrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis powerful bird relies primarily on lemmings and other small rodents for food during the breeding season, but at times of low prey density, or during the ptarmigan nesting period, they may switch to favoring juvenile ptarmigan. They are opportunistic hunters and prey species may vary considerably, especially in winter. They feed on a wide variety of small mammals such as meadow voles and deer mice, but will take advantage of larger prey, frequently following traplines to find food. Some of the larger mammal prey includes hares, muskrats, marmots, squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, prairie dogs, rats, moles and entrapped furbearers. Birds preyed upon include ptarmigan, ducks, geese, shorebirds, pheasants, grouse, coots, grebes, gulls, songbirds, and even other raptors, including other owl species. Most of the owls' hunting is done in the \\"sit and wait\\" style; prey may be captured on the ground or in the air, or fish may be snatched off the surface of bodies of water using their sharp talons. Each bird must capture roughly 7 to 12 mice per day to meet its food requirement and can eat more than 1,600 lemmings per year. Unlike most owls that hunt at night, snowy owls are also diurnal and hunt during the day and night.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnowy owls, like other carnivorous birds, swallow their small prey whole. Strong stomach juices digest the flesh, while the indigestible bones, teeth, fur, and feathers are compacted into oval pellets that the bird regurgitates 18 to 24 hours after feeding. Regurgitation often takes place at regular perches, where dozens of pellets may be found. Biologists frequently examine these pellets to determine the quantity and types of prey the birds have eaten. When large prey are eaten in small pieces, pellets will not be produced.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough snowy owls have few predators, the adults are very watchful and are equipped to defend against any kind of threat towards them or their offspring. During the nesting season, the owls regularly defend their nests against Arctic foxes, corvids and swift-flying jaegers; as well as dogs, gray wolves, and avian predators. Males defend the nest by standing guard nearby while the female incubates the eggs and broods the young. Both sexes attack approaching predators, dive-bombing them and engaging in distraction displays to draw the predator away from a nest.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also compete directly for lemmings and other prey with several predators, including rough-legged hawks, golden eagles, peregrine falcons, gyrfalcons, jaegers, glaucous gulls, short-eared owls, great horned owls, Eurasian eagle-owls, common ravens, wolves, Arctic foxes, and ermine. They are normally dominant over other raptors although may (sometimes fatally) lose in conflicts to large raptors such as other Bubo owls, golden eagles and the smaller but much faster peregrine falcons. Some species nesting near snowy owl nests, such as the snow goose, seem to benefit from the incidental protection of snowy owls that drive competing predators out of the area.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnowy owls are not known to interbreed with other owl species in the wild, and accordingly no hybrids of snowy owls and other owl species have yet been sighted in the wild. However, a hobby falconer in Kollnburg, Germany, managed to successfully breed hybrids from a male snowy owl and a female Eurasian eagle-owl in 2013.[20]  The two resulting male hybrid owls possessed the prominent ear tufts (generally absent in snowy owls), general size, orange eyes, and the same pattern of black markings on their plumage from their Eurasian eagle-owl mother, while retaining the generally black-and-white plumage colours from their snowy owl father. The hybrids were dubbed \\"Schnuhus\\", a portmanteau of the German words for snowy owl and Eurasian eagle-owl (Schnee-Eule and Uhu, respectively). As of 2014, the hybrids had grown to maturity and were healthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being considered of least concern by the IUCN since 1988, the snowy owl was upgraded to a conservation status of vulnerable in 2017. Previous population estimates of about 200,000 individuals are now regarded as substantially overestimated, and a total population size of 28,000 individuals is thought to be more realistic.[1]","input":"Do snowy owls live in the northern or southern hemisphere?"},{"output":"nine selective public high schools, established and run by the New York City Department of Education to serve the needs of academically and artistically gifted students","context":"The specialized high schools of New York City are nine selective public high schools, established and run by the New York City Department of Education to serve the needs of academically and artistically gifted students.

They were given use of an antiquated Gothic-gargoyled edifice located at Creston Avenue and 184th Street. The building, built in 1918 for Evander Childs High School, had been successively occupied by Walton High School (1930) and by an annex of DeWitt Clinton High School (1935).  The initial faculty were comprised in part by a contingent from Stuyvesant High School.[2] Principal Meister put his imprint on the school from its formation, for example selecting as school colors \\"green to represent chlorophyll and gold the sun, both of which are essential to the chain of life.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike nearly all other specialized high schools, Brooklyn Latin has a strong focus on the humanities and classics. All students are required to take four years of English, History, Latin and a modern foreign language. All classes regularly hold Socratic Seminars, in which students lead roundtable question-and-answer discussions, and all students take part in declamation (public speaking) exercises. Because of the small class size, Brooklyn Latin offers a relatively small student-to-teacher ratio (currently around 16:1).  All students are required to take International Baccalaureate courses in junior and senior year.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the original three specialized high schools in New York City (the other two being Stuyvesant High School and Bronx High School of Science). In 1918, Dr. Albert L. Colston, chair of the Math Department at Manual Training High School, recommended establishing a technical high school for Brooklyn boys. His plan envisioned a heavy concentration of math, science, and drafting courses with parallel paths leading either to college or to a technical career in industry. By 1922, Dr. Colston's concept was approved by the Board of Education, and Brooklyn Technical High School opened in a converted warehouse at 49 Flatbush Avenue Extension, with 2,400 students. This location, in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge, is the reason the school seal bears the image of this bridge, rather than the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Tech would occupy one more location before settling into its current[update] site, for which the groundbreaking was held in 1930.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiorello H.

McKee Vocational-Technical High School, located in the New Dorp neighborhood of Staten Island, after New Dorp High School, which had occupied the building since it was built in the 1930s, moved to its current location on New Dorp Lane. The technical courses were taught in the annex, while the vocational courses stayed in St. George.  Through the advocacy of parents, staff, and students, Staten Island Tech was made an independent high school by the New York City Board of Education in May 1988. Nicholas M. Bilotti, who had been serving as director of the annex, was appointed principal of the new high school.\\r\\n\\r\\nStuyvesant High School is named after Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch governor of New Netherland before the colony was transferred to England in 1664.[2] Of the nine Specialized high schools, Stuyvesant has the highest score cutoff for entry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe school was established in 1904 as a manual training school for boys, hosting 155 students and 12 teachers. In 1907, it moved from its original location at 225 East 23rd Street to a building designed by C. B. J. Snyder at 345 East 15th Street, where it remained for 85 years. It moved to its current location, a building on the Hudson River at 345 Chambers Street, in 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1934, Stuyvesant implemented a system of entrance examinations. The examination was developed with the assistance of Columbia University, and the program was later expanded to include the newly founded Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir status as specialized schools was frequently threatened by factions within the New York City school system and government.  As a way to preserve their special status, in 1972, the Hecht-Calandra Act was passed by the New York State Legislature, designating these schools as specialized science and math high schools for New York City.  The Act called for a uniform exam in math and science to be administered for admission to these schools, in keeping with the uniform examination that had already been required by the New York City Board of Education for admission to these schools.  The School of Performing Arts and The High School of Music & Art (consolidated in 1984 into LaGuardia High School) were also designated by the legislature as specialized high schools, and admission was by audition and portfolio rather than examination, in keeping with their artistic mission.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nStaten Island Tech began in 1982 as an annex of Ralph R.

World wars span multiple countries on multiple continents, with battles fought in many theaters. While a variety of global conflicts have been subjectively deemed \\"world wars\\", such as the Cold War and the War on Terror, the term is widely and generally accepted only as it is retrospectively applied to two major international conflicts that occurred during the 20th century: World War I (1914ÿ1918) and World War II (1939ÿ1945).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary cited the first known usage in the English language to a Scottish newspaper: the People's Journal in 1848: \\"A war among the great powers is now necessarily a world-war.\\" The term \\"world war\\" had been used in 1850 by Karl Marx and his associate, Friedrich Engels,[1] in The Class Struggles in France. Rasmus B. Anderson in 1889 described an episode in Teutonic mythology as a world war (Swedish: v?rldskrig), justifying this description by a line in an Old Norse epic poem, \\"V?lusp: folcvig fyrst i heimi\\" (\\"The first great war in the world\\".)[2] German writer August Wilhelm Otto Niemann had used the term \\"world war\\" in the title of his anti-British novel, Der Weltkrieg: Deutsche Tr?ume (The World War: German Dreams) in 1904, published in English as The Coming Conquest of England.\\r\\nIn English, the term \\"First World War\\" had been used by Charles  Court Repington, as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of Harvard University in his diary entry of September 10, 1918.[3]\\r\\nThe term \\"World War I\\" was coined by Time magazine in its issue of June 12, 1939. In the same article, the term \\"World War II\\" was first used speculatively to describe the upcoming war. The first use for the actual war came in its issue of September 11, 1939.[4] One week earlier, on September 4, the day after France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, the Danish newspaper Kristeligt Dagblad used the term on its front page, saying \\"The Second World War broke out yesterday at 11 a.m.\\"[5]\\r\\nSpeculative fiction authors had been noting the concept of a Second World War in 1919 and 1920, when Milo Hastings wrote his dystopian novel, City of Endless Night. Other languages have also adopted the \\"world war\\" terminology, for example; in French: \\"world war\\" is translated as guerre mondiale, in German: Weltkrieg (which, prior to the war, had been used in the more abstract meaning of a global conflict), in Italian: guerra mondiale, in Spanish and Portuguese: guerra mundial, in Danish and Norwegian: verdenskrig, and in Russian: ҰѾ־ ־񳭷 (mirovaya voyna.)\\r\\nIn terms of human technological history, the scale of the World War I was enabled by the technological advances of the second industrial revolution and the resulting globalization that allowed global power projection and mass production of military hardware, but wars on such a scale have not been repeated since the onset of the Atomic Age and the resulting danger of mutually-assured destruction. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing alliances (the German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires against the British, Russian, and French Empires) was likely to lead to a worldwide conflict if a war broke out. Due to this fact, a very minute conflict between two countries had the potential to set off a domino effect of alliances, triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large overseas empires virtually guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide, as the colonies' resources would be a crucial strategic factor. The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other's colonies, thus spreading the wars far more widely than those of pre-Columbian times.\\r\\nWar crimes were perpetrated in World War I. Chemical weapons were used in the First World War despite the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 having outlawed the use of such weapons in warfare. The Ottoman Empire has been considered responsible for the Armenian genocide, the death of over one million Armenians during the First World War.\\r\\nThe Second World War is the only conflict in which atomic bombs have been used. Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in Japan, were devastated by atomic bombs dropped by the United States. Nazi Germany was responsible for genocides, most notably the Holocaust, the killing of six million Jews. The United States, the Soviet Union, and Canada deported and interned minority groups within their own borders, and largely because of the conflict, many ethnic Germans were later expelled from Eastern Europe. Japan was responsible for attacking neutral nations without a declaration of war, such as the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It is also known for its brutal treatment and killing of Allied prisoners of war and the inhabitants of Asia. It also used Asians as forced laborers and was responsible for the Nanking massacre where 250,000 civilians in the city were brutally murdered by Japanese troops. Non-combatants suffered at least as badly as or worse than combatants, and the distinction between combatants and non-combatants was often blurred by belligerents of total war in both conflicts.\\r\\nThe outcome of World War II had a profound effect on the course of world history. The old European empires either collapsed or were dismantled as a direct result of the wars' crushing costs and, in some cases, their fall was due to the defeat of imperial powers. The United States became firmly established as the dominant global superpower, along with its ideological foe, the Soviet Union, in close competition. The two superpowers exerted political influence over most of the world's nation-states for decades after the end of the Second World War. The modern international security, economic, and diplomatic system was created in the aftermath of the wars.\\r\\nInstitutions such as the United Nations were established to collectivize international affairs, with the explicit goal of preventing another outbreak of general war. The wars had also greatly changed the course of daily life. Technologies developed during wartime had a profound effect on peacetime life as well, such as by advances in jet aircraft, penicillin, nuclear energy, and electronic computers.\\r\\nSince the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War, there has been a widespread and prolonged fear of a potential Third World War between nuclear-armed powers. The Third World War is generally considered a successor to the Second World War and is often suggested to become a nuclear war, devastating in nature and likely much more violent than the First World War and the Second World War combined; in 1947, Albert Einstein commented that \\"I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.\\"[6][7] It has been anticipated and planned for by military and civil authorities and has been explored in fiction in many countries. Concepts have ranged from purely-conventional scenarios, to limited use of nuclear weapons, to the complete destruction of the planet's surface.\\r\\nVarious former government officials, politicians, authors, and military leaders (including the following people: James Woolsey[8] Alexandre de Marenches,[9] Eliot Cohen,[10] and Subcomandante Marcos[11]) have attempted to apply the labels of the Third World War and Fourth World War to various past and present global wars since the closing of the Second World War, for example, the Cold War and the War on Terror, respectively. Among these are former American, French, and Mexican government officials, military leaders, politicians, and authors: Despite their efforts, none of these wars are commonly deemed world wars.\\r\\nThe Second Congo War (1998ÿ2003) involved nine nations and led to ongoing low-level warfare despite an official peace and the first democratic elections in 2006. It has often been referred to as \\"Africa's World War\\".[12] During the early-21st century the Syrian Civil War and the Iraqi Civil War and their worldwide spillovers are sometimes described as proxy wars waged between the United States and Russia,[13][14][15][16] which led some commentators to characterize the situation as a \\"proto-world war\\" with nearly a dozen countries embroiled in two overlapping conflicts.[17]\\r\\nThe two world wars of the 20th century had caused unprecedented casualties and destruction across the theaters of conflict.[18] There have been several wars that occurred before the 20th century with as many or more casualties than those of the First World War (16,563,868  40,000,000), including:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been numerous wars spanning two or more continents throughout history, including:","input":"When was the term world war ii first used?"},{"output":"United States","context":"Ground units:\\r\\n Tenth Army\\r\\nNaval units:\\r\\n Fifth Fleet\\r\\nGround units:\\r\\n Thirty-Second Army\\r\\nPersonnel:\\r\\n14,009 dead[5] to 20,195 dead[6][7][8]\\r\\nSoutheast Asia\\r\\nBurma\\r\\nSouthwest Pacific\\r\\nNorth America\\r\\nJapan\\r\\nManchuria\\r\\nThe Battle of Okinawa (Japanese: ?_??, Hepburn: Okinawa-sen) (Okinawan: ?_??, translit.?Uchinaa ikusa), codenamed Operation Iceberg,[18] was a major battle of the Pacific War fought on the island of Okinawa by United States Marine and Army forces against the Imperial Japanese Army.[19] The initial invasion of Okinawa on April 1, 1945, was the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific Theater of World War II.[20][21] The 82-day battle lasted from April 1 until June 22, 1945. After a long campaign of island hopping, the Allies were planning to use Okinawa, a large island only 340?mi (550?km) away from mainland Japan, as a base for air operations for the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands.\\r\\nThe United States created the Tenth Army, a cross-branch force consisting of the 7th, 27th, 77th, and 96th infantry divisions of the US Army with the 1st, 2nd, and 6th divisions of the Marine Corps, to fight on the island. The Tenth was unique in that it had its own tactical air force (joint Army-Marine command), and was also supported by combined naval and amphibious forces.\\r\\nThe battle has been referred to as the \\"typhoon of steel\\" in English, and tetsu no ame (\\"rain of steel\\") or tetsu no bf (\\"violent wind of steel\\") in Japanese.[22][23][24] The nicknames refer to the ferocity of the fighting, the intensity of Japanese kamikaze attacks, and the sheer numbers of Allied ships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island. The battle was one of the bloodiest in the Pacific, with approximately 160,000+ casualties on both sides: at least 75,682 Allied and 84,166ÿ117,000 Japanese,[25] including drafted Okinawans wearing Japanese uniforms.[15] 149,425 Okinawans were killed, committed suicide or went missing, a significant proportion of the estimated pre-war 300,000 local population.[25]\\r\\nIn the naval operations surrounding the battle, both sides lost considerable numbers of ships and aircraft, including the Japanese battleship Yamato. After the battle, Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields in proximity to Japan in preparation for the planned invasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCentral Pacific Task Forces (Fifth Fleet) under Admiral Raymond Spruance:\\r\\nTF 56 was the largest force within TF 50 and was built around the 10th Army. The army had two corps under its command: the III Amphibious Corps, consisting of 1st and 6th Marine Divisions, and the XXIV Corps, consisting of the 7th and 96th Infantry Divisions. The 2nd Marine Division was an afloat reserve, and the 10th Army also controlled the 27th Infantry Division, earmarked as a garrison, and the 77th Infantry Divisions.[29]\\r\\nIn all, the Army had over 102,000 soldiers (of these, 38,000+ were non-divisional artillery, combat support and HQ troops, with another 9,000 service troops),[27] over 88,000 Marines and 18,000 Navy personnel (mostly Seabees and medical personnel).[29] At the start of the Battle of Okinawa, the 10th Army had 182,821 personnel under its command.[29] It was planned that General Buckner would report to Turner until the amphibious phase was completed, after which he would report directly to Spruance.\\r\\nAlthough Allied land forces were entirely composed of American units, the British Pacific Fleet (BPF; known to the US Navy as Task Force 57) provided about ? of Allied naval air power (450 planes). It comprised a force which included 50 warships, of which 17 were aircraft carriers; while the British armored flight decks meant that fewer planes could be carried in a single aircraft carrier, they were more resistant to kamikaze strikes.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlthough all the aircraft carriers were provided by Britain, the carrier group was a combined British Commonwealth fleet with British, Canadian, New Zealand and Australian ships and personnel.[citation needed] Their mission was to neutralize Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands and provide air cover against Japanese kamikaze attacks. Most of the air-to-air fighters and the small dive bombers and strike aircraft were US Navy carrier-based airplanes.\\r\\nThe Japanese land campaign (mainly defensive) was conducted by the 67,000-strong (77,000 according to some sources) regular 32nd Army and some 9,000 Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) troops at Oroku naval base (only a few hundred of whom had been trained and equipped for ground combat), supported by 39,000 drafted local Ryukyuan people (including 24,000 hastily drafted rear militia called Boeitai and 15,000 non-uniformed laborers). The Japanese had used kamikaze tactics since the Battle of Leyte Gulf, but for the first time, they became a major part of the defense. Between the American landing on April 1 and May 25, seven major kamikaze attacks were attempted, involving more than 1,500 planes.\\r\\nThe 32nd Army initially consisted of the 9th, 24th, and 62nd Divisions, and the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade. The 9th Division was moved to Taiwan before the invasion, resulting in shuffling of Japanese defensive plans. Primary resistance was to be led in the south by Lieutenant General Mitsuru Ushijima, his chief of staff, Lieutenant General Isamu Ch and his chief of operations, Colonel Hiromichi Yahara. Yahara advocated a defensive strategy, whilst Ch advocated an offensive one.\\r\\nIn the north, Colonel Takehido Udo was in command. The IJN troops were led by Rear Admiral Minoru ta. They expected the Americans to land 6ÿ10 divisions against the Japanese garrison of two and a half divisions. The staff calculated that superior quality and numbers of weapons gave each US division five or six times the firepower of a Japanese division. To this, would be added the Americans' abundant naval and air firepower.\\r\\nIn Okinawa island, middle school boys were organized into front-line-service Tekketsu Kinntai, while Himeyuri students were organized into a nursing unit.[30]\\r\\nThe Japanese Imperial Army mobilized 1,780 middle school boys aged 14ÿ17 years into front-line-service. They were named \\"Tekketsu Kinntai\\" (ja:?㪧?, Iron and Blood Imperial Corps). This mobilization was conducted by the ordinance of the Ministry of Army, not by law.\\r\\nThe ordinances mobilized the student as a volunteer soldier for form's sake. In reality, the military authorities ordered schools to force almost all students to \\"volunteer\\" as soldiers. Sometimes they counterfeited the necessary documents. About half of Tekketsu Kinntai were killed, including in suicide bomb attacks against tanks, and in guerrilla operations.\\r\\nAfter losing the Battle of Okinawa, the Japanese government enacted new laws in preparation for the decisive battles in the main islands. These laws made it possible for boys aged 15 or older and girls aged 17 or older to be drafted into front-line-service.\\r\\nTekketsu Kinntai child soldiers\\r\\nA US military diagram of typical Japanese hill defensive tunnels and installations\\r\\nA Japanese Type 89 150mm gun hidden inside a cave defensive system\\r\\nA map of Okinawa's airfields, 1945\\r\\nVice Admiral C.R. Brown, US Navy[31]\\r\\nThe United States Navy's Task Force 58, deployed to the east of Okinawa with a picket group of from 6 to 8 destroyers, kept 13 carriers (7 CVs and 6 CVLs) on duty from March 23 to April 27 and a smaller number thereafter. Until April 27, a minimum of 14 and up to 18 escort carriers (CVEs) were in the area at all times. Until April 20, British Task Force 57, with 4 large and 6 escort carriers, remained off the Sakishima Islands to protect the southern flank.[32]\\r\\nThe protracted length of the campaign under stressful conditions forced Admiral Chester W. Nimitz to take the unprecedented step of relieving the principal naval commanders to rest and recuperate. Following the practice of changing the fleet designation with the change of commanders, US naval forces began the campaign as the US 5th Fleet under Admiral Raymond Spruance, but ended it as the 3rd Fleet under Admiral William Halsey.\\r\\nJapanese air opposition had been relatively light during the first few days after the landings. However, on April 6, the expected air reaction began with an attack by 400 planes from Kyushu. Periodic heavy air attacks continued through April. During the period March 26?ÿ April 30, twenty American ships were sunk and 157 damaged by enemy action. For their part, by April 30, the Japanese had lost more than 1,100 planes to Allied naval forces alone.[33]\\r\\nBetween April 6 and June 22, the Japanese flew 1,465 kamikaze aircraft in large-scale attacks from Kyushu, 185 individual kamikaze sorties from Kyushu, and 250 individual kamikaze sorties from Formosa. While US intelligence estimated there were 89 planes on Formosa, the Japanese actually had about 700, dismantled or well camouflaged and dispersed into scattered villages and towns; the US Fifth Air Force disputed Navy claims of kamikaze coming from Formosa.[34][clarification needed]\\r\\nThe ships lost were smaller vessels, particularly the destroyers of the radar pickets, as well as destroyer escorts and landing ships. While no major Allied warships were lost, several fleet carriers were severely damaged. Land-based Shin'y-class suicide motorboats were also used in the Japanese suicide attacks, although Ushijima had disbanded the majority of the suicide boat battalions prior to the battle due to expected low effectiveness against a superior enemy. The boat crews were re-formed into three additional infantry battalions.[35]\\r\\nOperation Ten-Go (Ten-g sakusen) was the attempted attack by a strike force of 10 Japanese surface vessels, led by the super battleship Yamato and commanded by Admiral Seiichi It. This small task force had been ordered to fight through enemy naval forces, then beach Yamato and fight from shore, using her guns as coastal artillery and her crew as naval infantry. The Ten-Go force was spotted by submarines shortly after it left the Japanese home waters, and was intercepted by US carrier aircraft.\\r\\nUnder attack from more than 300 aircraft over a two-hour span, the world's largest battleship sank on April 7, 1945, after a one-sided battle, long before she could reach Okinawa. (US torpedo bombers were instructed to aim for only one side to prevent effective counter flooding by the battleship's crew, and to aim for the bow or the stern, where armor was believed to be the thinnest.) Of Yamato's screening force, the light cruiser Yahagi and 4 of the 8 destroyers were also sunk. The Imperial Japanese Navy lost some 3,700 sailors, including Admiral It, at the cost of 10 US aircraft and 12 airmen.\\r\\nThe British Pacific Fleet, taking part as Task Force 57, was assigned the task of neutralizing the Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands, which it did successfully from March 26 to April 10.\\r\\nOn April 10, its attention was shifted to airfields on northern Formosa. The force withdrew to San Pedro Bay on April 23.\\r\\nOn May 1, the British Pacific Fleet returned to action, subduing the airfields as before, this time with naval bombardment as well as aircraft. Several kamikaze attacks caused significant damage, but since the British had armored flight decks on their aircraft carriers, they experienced only a brief interruption to their force's operations.[36][37]\\r\\nThe land battle took place over about 81 days beginning on April 1, 1945. The first Americans ashore were soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, who landed in the Kerama Islands, 15?mi (24?km) west of Okinawa on March 26. Subsidiary landings followed, and the Kerama group was secured over the next five days. In these preliminary operations, the 77th Infantry Division suffered 27 dead and 81 wounded, while Japanese dead and captured numbered over 650. The operation provided a protected anchorage for the fleet and eliminated the threat from suicide boats.\\r\\nOn March 31, Marines of the Fleet Marine Force Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion landed without opposition on Keise Shima, four islets just 8?mi (13?km) west of the Okinawan capital of Naha. A group of 155?mm (6.1?in) \\"Long Tom\\" artillery pieces went ashore on the islets to cover operations on Okinawa.\\r\\nThe main landing was made by the XXIV Corps and the III Amphibious Corps on the Hagushi beaches on the western coast of Okinawa on L-Day, April 1, which was both Easter Sunday and April Fools' Day in 1945. The 2nd Marine Division conducted a demonstration off the Minatoga beaches on the southeastern coast to deceive the Japanese about American intentions and delay movement of reserves from there.\\r\\nThe 10th Army swept across[38] the south-central part of the island with relative ease by World War II standards, capturing the Kadena and the Yomitan airbases within hours of the landing. In light of the weak opposition, General Buckner decided to proceed immediately with Phase II of his planthe seizure of northern Okinawa. The 6th Marine Division headed up the Ishikawa Isthmus and by April 7, had sealed off the Motobu Peninsula.\\r\\nSix days later on April 13, the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Marine Regiment, reached Hedo Point (Hedo-misaki) at the northernmost tip of the island. By this point, the bulk of the Japanese forces in the north (codenamed Udo Force) were cornered on the Motobu Peninsula. Here, the terrain was mountainous and wooded, with the Japanese defenses concentrated on Yae-Dake, a twisted mass of rocky ridges and ravines on the center of the peninsula. There was heavy fighting before the Marines finally cleared Yae-Dake on April 18.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the 77th Infantry Division assaulted Ie Island (Ie Shima)a small island off the western end of the peninsulaon April 16. In addition to conventional hazards, the 77th Infantry Division encountered kamikaze attacks, and even local women armed with spears. There was heavy fighting before the area was declared secured on April 21, and became another air base for operations against Japan.\\r\\nWhile the 6th Marine Division cleared northern Okinawa, the US Army 96th and 7th Infantry Divisions wheeled south across the narrow waist of Okinawa. The 96th Infantry Division began to encounter fierce resistance in west-central Okinawa from Japanese troops holding fortified positions east of Highway No. 1 and about 5?mi (8?km) northwest of Shuri, from what came to be known as Cactus Ridge. The 7th Infantry Division encountered similarly fierce Japanese opposition from a rocky pinnacle located about 1,000?yd (910?m) southwest of Arakachi (later dubbed \\"The Pinnacle\\"). By the night of April 8, American troops had cleared these and several other strongly fortified positions. They suffered over 1,500 battle casualties in the process, while killing or capturing about 4,500 Japanese. Yet the battle had only begun, for it was now realized that \\"these were merely outposts,\\" guarding the Shuri Line.\\r\\nThe next American objective was Kakazu Ridge, two hills with a connecting saddle that formed part of Shuri's outer defenses. The Japanese had prepared their positions well and fought tenaciously. The Japanese soldiers hid in fortified caves. American forces often lost personnel before clearing the Japanese out from each cave or other hiding place. The Japanese sent Okinawans at gunpoint out to obtain water and supplies for them, which led to civilian casualties. The American advance was inexorable, but resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides.\\r\\nAs the American assault against Kakazu Ridge stalled, Lieutenant General Ushijima  influenced by General Ch  decided to take the offensive. On the evening of April 12, the 32nd Army attacked American positions across the entire front. The Japanese attack was heavy, sustained, and well organized. After fierce close combat, the attackers retreated, only to repeat their offensive the following night. A final assault on April 14 was again repulsed. The effort led the 32nd Army's staff to conclude that the Americans were vulnerable to night infiltration tactics, but that their superior firepower made any offensive Japanese troop concentrations extremely dangerous, and they reverted to their defensive strategy.\\r\\nThe 27th Infantry Divisionwhich had landed on April 9took over on the right, along the west coast of Okinawa. General John R. Hodge now had three divisions in the line, with the 96th in the middle, and the 7th to the east, with each division holding a front of only about 1.5?mi (2.4?km). Hodge launched a new offensive of April 19 with a barrage of 324 guns, the largest ever in the Pacific Ocean Theater. Battleships, cruisers, and destroyers joined the bombardment, which was followed by 650 Navy and Marine planes attacking the enemy positions with napalm, rockets, bombs, and machine guns. The Japanese defenses were sited on reverse slopes, where the defenders waited out the artillery barrage and aerial attack in relative safety, emerging from the caves to rain mortar rounds and grenades upon the Americans advancing up the forward slope.\\r\\nA tank assault to achieve breakthrough by outflanking Kakazu Ridge failed to link up with its infantry support attempting to cross the ridge, and therefore failed with the loss of 22 tanks. Although flame tanks cleared many cave defenses, there was no breakthrough, and the XXIV Corps suffered 720 casualties. The losses might have been greater except for the fact that the Japanese had practically all of their infantry reserves tied up farther south, held there by another feint off the Minatoga beaches by the 2nd Marine Division that coincided with the attack.\\r\\nAt the end of April, after Army forces had pushed through the Machinato defensive line,[39] the 1st Marine Division relieved the 27th Infantry Division, and the 77th Infantry Division relieved the 96th. When the 6th Marine Division arrived, the III Amphibious Corps took over the right flank and the 10th Army assumed control of the battle.\\r\\nOn May 4, the 32nd Army launched another counteroffensive. This time, Ushijima attempted to make amphibious assaults on the coasts behind American lines. To support his offensive, the Japanese artillery moved into the open. By doing so, they were able to fire 13,000 rounds in support, but effective American counter-battery fire destroyed dozens of Japanese artillery pieces. The attack failed.\\r\\nBuckner launched another American attack on May 11. Ten days of fierce fighting followed. On May 13, troops of the 96th Infantry Division and 763rd Tank Battalion captured Conical Hill. Rising 476?ft (145?m) above the Yonabaru coastal plain, this feature was the eastern anchor of the main Japanese defenses and was defended by about 1,000 Japanese. Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions fought for \\"Sugar Loaf Hill\\". The capture of these two key positions exposed the Japanese around Shuri on both sides. Buckner hoped to envelop Shuri and trap the main Japanese defending force.\\r\\nBy the end of May, monsoon rains which had turned contested hills and roads into a morass exacerbated both the tactical and medical situations. The ground advance began to resemble a World War I battlefield, as troops became mired in mud, and flooded roads greatly inhibited evacuation of wounded to the rear. Troops lived on a field sodden by rain, part garbage dump and part graveyard. Unburied Japanese and American bodies decayed, sank in the mud, and became part of a noxious stew. Anyone sliding down the greasy slopes could easily find their pockets full of maggots at the end of the journey.[40]\\r\\nOn May 29, Major General Pedro del Valle, commander of the 1st Marine Division, ordered Captain Julian D. Dusenbury of[41] Company A, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, to capture Shuri Castle. Seizure of the castle represented both strategic and psychological blows for the Japanese and was a milestone in the campaign. Del Valle was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his leadership in the fight and the subsequent occupation and reorganization of Okinawa. Captain Dusenbury would later receive the Navy Cross for his actions.[41]\\r\\nShuri Castle had been shelled by the battleship USS?Mississippi for three days before this advance.[42] Due to this, the 32nd Army withdrew to the south and thus the Marines had an easy task of securing Shuri Castle.[42][43] The castle, however, was outside the 1st Marine Division's assigned zone and only frantic efforts by the commander and staff of the 77th Infantry Division prevented an American air strike and artillery bombardment which would have resulted in many casualties due to friendly fire.\\r\\nThe Japanese retreat, although harassed by artillery fire, was conducted with great skill at night and aided by the monsoon storms. The 32nd Army was able to move nearly 30,000 personnel into its last defense line on the Kiyan Peninsula, which ultimately led to the greatest slaughter on Okinawa in the latter stages of the battle, including the deaths of thousands of civilians. In addition, there were 9,000 IJN troops supported by 1,100 militia, with approximately 4,000 holed up at the underground headquarters on the hillside overlooking the Okinawa Naval Base in the Oroku Peninsula, east of the airfield.\\r\\nOn June 4, elements of the 6th Marine Division launched an amphibious assault on the peninsula. The 4,000 Japanese sailors, including Admiral Minoru ta, all committed suicide within the hand-built tunnels of the underground naval headquarters on June 13. By June 17, the remnants of Ushijima's shattered 32nd Army were pushed into a small pocket in the far south of the island to the southeast of Itoman.\\r\\nOn June 18, General Buckner was killed by enemy artillery fire while monitoring the forward progress of his troops. Buckner was replaced by Roy Geiger. Upon assuming command, Geiger became the only US Marine to command a numbered army of the US Army in combat; he was relieved five days later by Joseph Stilwell.\\r\\nThe last remnants of Japanese resistance ended on June 21, although some Japanese continued hiding, including the future governor of Okinawa Prefecture, Masahide ta.[44] Ushijima and Ch committed suicide by seppuku in their command headquarters on Hill 89 in the closing hours of the battle. Colonel Yahara had asked Ushijima for permission to commit suicide, but the general refused his request, saying: \\"If you die there will be no one left who knows the truth about the battle of Okinawa. Bear the temporary shame but endure it. This is an order from your army Commander.\\"[45] Yahara was the most senior officer to have survived the battle on the island, and he later authored a book titled The Battle for Okinawa. On August 15, 1945, Admiral Matome Ugaki was killed while part of a kamikaze raid on Iheyajima island. The official surrender ceremony was held on September 7, near Kadena airfield.\\r\\nOkinawa was the bloodiest battle of the Pacific War.[46][47][48] The most complete tally of deaths during the battle is at the Cornerstone of Peace monument at the Okinawa Prefecture Peace Park, which identifies the names of each individual who died at Okinawa in World War?II. As of 2010, the monument lists 240,931 names, including 149,193 Okinawan civilians, 77,166 Imperial Japanese soldiers, 14,009 American soldiers, and smaller numbers of people from South Korea (365), the United Kingdom (82), North Korea (82) and Taiwan (34).[14]\\r\\nThe numbers correspond to recorded deaths during the Battle of Okinawa from the time of the American landings in the Kerama Islands on March 26, 1945, to the signing of the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945, in addition to all Okinawan casualties in the Pacific War in the fifteen years from the Manchurian Incident, along with those who died in Okinawa from war-related events in the year before the battle and the year after the surrender.[49] 234,183 names were inscribed by the time of unveiling and new names are added each year.[50][51][52] Forty thousand of the Okinawan civilians killed had been drafted or impressed by the Japanese army and are often counted as combat deaths.\\r\\nThe Americans suffered over 82,000 casualties, including non-battle casualties (psychiatric, injuries, illnesses), of whom over 12,500 were killed or missing. Battle deaths were 4,907 Navy, 4,675 Army, and 2,938 Marine Corps personnel.[9] Several thousand personnel who died indirectly (from wounds and other causes) at a later date are not included in the total.\\r\\nThe most famous American casualty was Lieutenant General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr., whose decision to attack the Japanese defenses head-on, although extremely costly in American lives, was ultimately successful. Four days from the closing of the campaign, Buckner was killed by Japanese artillery fire, which blew lethal slivers of coral into his body, while inspecting his troops at the front line. He was the highest-ranking US officer to be killed by enemy fire during the Second World War. The day after Buckner was killed, Brigadier General Claudius Miller Easley was killed by sniper fire. The famous war correspondent Ernie Pyle, was killed by Japanese sniper fire on Ie Island (Ie Shima, a small island just off of northwestern Okinawa).[53]\\r\\nAircraft losses over the three-month period were 768 US planes, including those bombing the Kyushu airfields launching kamikazes. Combat losses were 458, and the other 310 were operational accidents. On land, at least 225 tanks and many LVTs were lost. At sea, 368 Allied shipsincluding 120 amphibious craftwere damaged while another 36including 15 amphibious ships and 12 destroyerswere sunk during the Okinawa campaign. The US Navy's dead exceeded its wounded, with 4,907 killed and 4,874 wounded, primarily from kamikaze attacks.[54]\\r\\nAmerican personnel casualties included thousands of cases of mental breakdown. According to the account of the battle presented in Marine Corps Gazette:\\r\\nMore mental health issues arose from the Battle of Okinawa than any other battle in the Pacific during World War II. The constant bombardment from artillery and mortars coupled with the high casualty rates led to a great deal of personnel coming down with combat fatigue. Additionally the rains caused mud that prevented tanks from moving and tracks from pulling out the dead, forcing Marines (who pride themselves on burying their dead in a proper and honorable manner) to leave their comrades where they lay. This, coupled with thousands of bodies both friend and foe littering the entire island, created a scent you could nearly taste. Morale was dangerously low by the month of May and the state of discipline on a moral basis had a new low barometer for acceptable behavior. The ruthless atrocities by the Japanese throughout the war had already brought on an altered behavior (deemed so by traditional standards) by many Americans resulting in the desecration of Japanese remains, but the Japanese tactic of using the Okinawan people as human shields brought about a new aspect of terror and torment to the psychological capacity of the Americans.[15]\\r\\nMedal of Honor recipients from Okinawa are:\\r\\nThe US military estimates that 110,071 Japanese soldiers were killed during the battle. This total includes conscripted Okinawan civilians.\\r\\nA total of 7,401 Japanese regulars and 3,400 Okinawan conscripts surrendered or were captured during the battle. Additional Japanese and renegade Okinawans were captured or surrendered over the next few months, bringing the total to 16,346.[55] This was the first battle in the Pacific War in which thousands of Japanese soldiers surrendered or were captured. Many of the prisoners were native Okinawans who had been pressed into service shortly before the battle, and were less imbued with the Imperial Japanese Army's no-surrender doctrine.[56] When the American forces occupied the island, many Japanese soldiers put on Okinawan clothing to avoid capture, and some Okinawans would come to the Americans' aid by offering to identify these mainland Japanese.\\r\\nThe Japanese lost 16 combat vessels, including the super battleship Yamato. Postwar examination of Japanese records revealed that Japanese aircraft losses at Okinawa were far below often-repeated US estimates for the campaign.[16] The number of conventional and kamikaze aircraft actually lost or expended by the 3rd, 5th, and 10th Air Fleets, combined with about 500 lost or expended by the Imperial Army at Okinawa, was roughly 1,430.[16] The Allies destroyed 27 Japanese tanks and 743 artillery pieces (including mortars, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns), some of them eliminated by the naval and air bombardments but most knocked out by American counter-battery fire.\\r\\nSome of the other islands that saw major battles in World War II, such as Iwo Jima, were uninhabited or had been evacuated. Okinawa, by contrast, had a large indigenous civilian population; US Army records from the planning phase of the operation make the assumption that Okinawa was home to about 300,000 civilians. According to various estimates, between a tenth and a third of them died during the battle,[40] between 30,000 and 100,000. Okinawa Prefecture's estimate is over 100,000 losses,[57] while the official US Army count for the 82-day campaign is a total of 142,058 civilian casualties, including those killed by artillery fire, air attacks, and those pressed into service by the Imperial Japanese Army.[40]\\r\\nDuring the battle, American soldiers found it difficult to distinguish civilians from soldiers. It became common for them to shoot at Okinawan houses, as one infantryman wrote:\\r\\nThere was some return fire from a few of the houses, but the others were probably occupied by civilians ÿ and we didn't care. It was a terrible thing not to distinguish between the enemy and women and children. Americans always had great compassion, especially for children. Now we fired indiscriminately.[58]\\r\\nIn its history of the war, the Okinawa Prefectural Peace Memorial Museum[57] presents Okinawa as being caught between the United States and Japan. During the 1945 battle, the Imperial Japanese Army showed indifference to Okinawans' safety, and its soldiers even used civilians as human shields or just outright murdered them. The Japanese military confiscated food from the Okinawans and executed those who hid it, leading to mass starvation, and forced civilians out of their shelters. Japanese soldiers also killed about 1,000 people who spoke in the Okinawan language to suppress spying.[59] The museum writes that \\"some were blown apart by [artillery] shells, some finding themselves in a hopeless situation were driven to suicide, some died of starvation, some succumbed to malaria, while others fell victim to the retreating Japanese troops.\\"[57]\\r\\nWith the impending Japanese defeat, civilians often committed mass suicide, urged on by the Japanese soldiers who told locals that victorious American soldiers would go on a rampage of killing and raping. Ryky Shimp, one of the two major Okinawan newspapers, wrote in 2007: \\"There are many Okinawans who have testified that the Japanese Army directed them to commit suicide. There are also people who have testified that they were handed grenades by Japanese soldiers\\" to blow themselves up.[60] Thousands of civilians, having been induced by Japanese propaganda to believe that American soldiers were barbarians who committed horrible atrocities, killed their families and themselves to avoid capture. Some of them threw themselves and their family members from the southern cliffs where the Peace Museum now resides.[61] Okinawans \\"were often surprised at the comparatively humane treatment they received from the American enemy\\".[62][63] Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power by Mark Selden notes that the Americans \\"did not pursue a policy of torture, rape, and murder of civilians as Japanese military officials had warned\\".[64] American Military Intelligence Corps[65] combat translators such as Teruto Tsubota managed to convince many civilians not to kill themselves.[66] Survivors of the mass suicides blamed also the indoctrination of their education system of the time, in which the Okinawans were taught to become \\"more Japanese than the Japanese\\", and were expected to prove it.[67]\\r\\nWitnesses and historians reported that soldiers, mainly Japanese troops, raped Okinawan women during the battle. Rape by Japanese troops \\"became common\\"[attribution needed] in June, after it became clear that the Imperial Japanese Army had been defeated.[30][68] Marine Corps officials in Okinawa and Washington have said that they knew of no rapes by American personnel in Okinawa at the end of the war.[69] There are, however, numerous credible testimony accounts which allege that a large number of rapes were committed by American forces during the battle. This includes claimed rape after trading sexual favors or even marrying Americans,[70] such as the alleged incident in the village of Katsuyama, where civilians said they had formed a vigilante group to ambush and kill three black American soldiers whom they claimed would frequently rape the local girls there.[71]\\r\\nThere is ongoing disagreement between Okinawa's local government and Japan's national government over the role of the Japanese military in civilian mass suicides during the battle. In March 2007, the national Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) advised textbook publishers to reword descriptions that the embattled Imperial Japanese Army forced civilians to kill themselves in the war to avoid being taken prisoner. MEXT preferred descriptions that just say that civilians received hand grenades from the Japanese military. This move sparked widespread protests among Okinawans. In June 2007, the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly adopted a resolution stating, \\"We strongly call on the (national) government to retract the instruction and to immediately restore the description in the textbooks so the truth of the Battle of Okinawa will be handed down correctly and a tragic war will never happen again.\\"[72][73]\\r\\nOn September 29, 2007, about 110,000 people held the biggest political rally in the history of Okinawa to demand that MEXT retract its order to textbook publishers regarding revising the account of the civilian suicides. The resolution stated, \\"It is an undeniable fact that the 'multiple suicides' would not have occurred without the involvement of the Japanese military and any deletion of or revision to (the descriptions) is a denial and distortion of the many testimonies by those people who survived the incidents.\\"[74] In December 2007, MEXT partially admitted the role of the Japanese military in civilian mass suicides.[75] The ministry's Textbook Authorization Council allowed the publishers to reinstate the reference that civilians \\"were forced into mass suicides by the Japanese military\\", on condition it is placed in sufficient context. The council report stated, \\"It can be said that from the viewpoint of the Okinawa residents, they were forced into the mass suicides.\\"[76] That was not enough for the survivors who said it is important for children today to know what really happened.[77]\\r\\nThe Nobel Prize-winning author Kenzabur e wrote a booklet which states that the mass suicide order was given by the military during the battle.[78] He was sued by revisionists, including a wartime commander during the battle, who disputed this and wanted to stop publication of the booklet. At a court hearing, e testified \\"Mass suicides were forced on Okinawa islanders under Japan's hierarchical social structure that ran through the state of Japan, the Japanese armed forces and local garrisons.\\"[79] In March 2008, the Osaka Prefecture Court ruled in favor of e, stating, \\"It can be said the military was deeply involved in the mass suicides.\\" The court recognized the military's involvement in the mass suicides and murder-suicides, citing the testimony about the distribution of grenades for suicide by soldiers and the fact that mass suicides were not recorded on islands where the military was not stationed.[80]\\r\\nIn 2012, Korean-Japanese director Pak Su-nam announced her work on the documentary Nuchigafu (Okinawan for \\"only if one is alive\\") collecting living survivors' accounts to show \\"the truth of history to many people\\", alleging that \\"there were two types of orders for 'honorable deaths'one for residents to kill each other and the other for the military to kill all residents\\".[81] In March 2013, Japanese textbook publisher Shimizu Shoin was permitted by MEXT to publish the statements that \\"Orders from Japanese soldiers led to Okinawans committing group suicide\\" and \\"The [Japanese] army caused many tragedies in Okinawa, killing local civilians and forcing them to commit mass suicide.\\"[82]\\r\\nNinety percent of the buildings on the island were destroyed, along with countless historical documents, artifacts, and cultural treasures, and the tropical landscape was turned into \\"a vast field of mud, lead, decay and maggots\\".[83] The military value of Okinawa \\"exceeded all hope\\". Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields in proximity to Japan. The US cleared the surrounding waters of mines in Operation Zebra, occupied Okinawa, and set up the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands, a form of military government, after the battle.[84] In 2011, one official of the prefectural government told David Hearst of The Guardian:\\r\\nYou have the Battle of Britain, in which your airmen protected the British people. We had the Battle of Okinawa, in which the exact opposite happened. The Japanese army not only starved the Okinawans but used them as human shields. That dark history is still present today?ÿ and Japan and the US should study it before they decide what to do with next.[85]\\r\\nBecause the next major event following the Battle of Okinawa was \\"the total surrender of Japan,\\" the \\"effect\\" of this battle is more difficult to consider. Due to the surrender, the next anticipated series of battles ÿ an invasion of the Japanese homeland ÿ never occurred. (Therefore, all military strategies on both sides which presupposed this apparently-inevitable next development were immediately rendered moot.)\\r\\nSome military historians believe that the Okinawa campaign led directly to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as a means of avoiding the planned ground invasion of the Japanese mainland. This view is explained by Victor Davis Hanson in his book Ripples of Battle:\\r\\n...?because the Japanese on Okinawa?... were so fierce in their defense (even when cut off, and without supplies), and because casualties were so appalling, many American strategists looked for an alternative means to subdue mainland Japan, other than a direct invasion. This means presented itself, with the advent of atomic bombs, which worked admirably in convincing the Japanese to sue for peace [unconditionally], without American casualties.\\r\\nMeanwhile, many parties continue to debate the broader question of \\"why Japan surrendered\\", attributing the surrender to a number of possible reasons including: the atomic bombings,[86][87][88] the Soviet invasion of Manchuria,[89][90] and Japan's depleted resources.[91][page?needed][92]\\r\\nIn 1995, the Okinawa government erected a memorial monument named the Cornerstone of Peace in Mabuni, the site of the last fighting in southeastern Okinawa.[93] The memorial lists all the known names of those who died in the battle, civilian and military, Japanese and foreign. As of June 2008, it contains 240,734 names.[94]\\r\\nSignificant US forces remain garrisoned on Okinawa as the United States Forces Japan, which the Japanese government sees as an important guarantee of regional stability,[95] and Kadena remains the largest US air base in Asia. Local residents have protested against the size and presence of the base.[96][97]","input":"Who was involved in the battle of okinawa?"},{"output":"a method of controlling pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using other organisms","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBiological control or biocontrol is a method of controlling pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using other organisms.[1] It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. It can be an important component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three basic strategies for biological pest control: classical (importation), where a natural enemy of a pest is introduced in the hope of achieving control; inductive (augmentation), in which a large population of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control; and inoculative (conservation), in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural enemies of insect pests, also known as biological control agents, include predators, parasitoids, pathogens, and competitors. Biological control agents of plant diseases are most often referred to as antagonists. Biological control agents of weeds include seed predators, herbivores and plant pathogens.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiological control can have side-effects on biodiversity through attacks on non-target species by any of the same mechanisms, especially when a species is introduced without thorough understanding of the possible consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"biological control\\" was first used by Harry Scott Smith at the 1919 meeting of the Pacific Slope Branch of the American Association of Economic Entomologists, in Riverside, California.[3] It was brought into more widespread use by the entomologist Paul H. DeBach (1914ÿ1993) who worked on citrus crop pests throughout his life.[4][5] However, the practice has previously been used for centuries. The first report of the use of an insect species to control an insect pest comes from \\"Nanfang Caomu Zhuang\\" (qԴJ?? Plants of the Southern Regions) (ca. 304 AD), attributed to Western Jin dynasty botanist Ji Han (d, 263ÿ307), in which it is mentioned that \\"Jiaozhi people sell ants and their nests attached to twigs looking like thin cotton envelopes, the reddish-yellow ant being larger than normal. Without such ants, southern citrus fruits will be severely insect-damaged\\".[6] The ants used are known as huang gan (huang = yellow, gan = citrus) ants (Oecophylla smaragdina). The practice was later reported by Ling Biao Lu Yi (late Tang Dynasty or Early Five Dynasties), in Ji Le Pian by Zhuang Jisu (Southern Song Dynasty), in the Book of Tree Planting by Yu Zhen Mu (Ming Dynasty), in the book Guangdong Xing Yu (17th century), Lingnan by Wu Zhen Fang (Qing Dynasty), in Nanyue Miscellanies by Li Diao Yuan, and others.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBiological control techniques as we know them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883ÿ1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888ÿ1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, but by the end of 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1905 the USDA initiated its first large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan to look for natural enemies of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar, and brown-tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also led to the development of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.[7][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrickly pear cacti were introduced into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788. They quickly spread to cover over 25 million hectares of Australia by 1920, increasing by 1 million hectares per year. Digging, burning and crushing all proved ineffective. Two control agents were introduced to help control the spread of the plant, the cactus moth Cactoblastis cactorum, and the scale insect Dactylopius. Between 1926 and 1931, tens of millions of cactus moth eggs were distributed around Queensland with great success, and by 1932, most areas of prickly pear had been destroyed.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first reported case of a classical biological control attempt in Canada involves the parasitoidal wasp Trichogramma minutum. Individuals were caught in New York State and released in Ontario gardens in 1882 by William Saunders, trained chemist and first Director of the Dominion Experimental Farms, for controlling the invasive currantworm Nematus ribesii. Between 1884 and 1908, the first Dominion Entomologist, James Fletcher, continued introductions of other parasitoids and pathogens for the control of pests in Canada.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three basic biological pest control strategies: importation (classical biological control), augmentation and conservation.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nImportation or classical biological control involves the introduction of a pest's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally. Early instances were often unofficial and not based on research, and some introduced species became serious pests themselves.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be most effective at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it to keep pace with changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nJoseph Needham noted a Chinese text dating from 304 AD, Records of the Plants and Trees of the Southern Regions, by Hsi Han, which describes mandarin oranges protected by large reddish-yellow citrus ants which attack and kill insect pests of the orange trees. The citrus ant (Oecophylla smaragdina)[15] was rediscovered in the 20th century, and since 1958 has been used in China to protect orange groves.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the earliest successes in the west was in controlling Icerya purchasi (cottony cushion scale) in Australia, using a predatory insect Rodolia cardinalis (the vedalia beetle). This success was repeated in California using the beetle and a parasitoidal fly, Cryptochaetum iceryae.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nDamage from Hypera postica, the alfalfa weevil, a serious introduced pest of forage, was substantially reduced by the introduction of natural enemies. 20 years after their introduction the population of weevils in the alfalfa area treated for alfalfa weevil in the Northeastern United States remained 75 percent down.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlligator weed was introduced to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant.[19] Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates,[20][21] and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall commercially reared parasitoidal wasps,[12] Trichogramma ostriniae, provide limited and erratic control of the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis), a serious pest. Careful formulations of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis are more effective.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population of Levuana iridescens, the Levuana moth, a serious coconut pest in Fiji, was brought under control by a classical biological control program in the 1920s.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAugmentation involves the supplemental release of natural enemies that occur in a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals to allow them to reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of inoculative release occurs in the horticultural production of several crops in greenhouses. Periodic releases of the parasitoidal wasp, Encarsia formosa, are used to control greenhouse whitefly,[26] while the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis is used for control of the two-spotted spider mite.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe egg parasite Trichogramma is frequently released inundatively to control harmful moths. Similarly, Bacillus thuringiensis and other microbial insecticides are used in large enough quantities for a rapid effect.[25] Recommended release rates for Trichogramma in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre (1 to 50 per square metre) per week according to the level of pest infestation.[28] Similarly, nematodes that kill insects (that are entomopathogenic) are released at rates of millions and even billions per acre for control of certain soil-dwelling insect pests.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conservation of existing natural enemies in an environment is the third method of biological pest control.[30]\\r\\nNatural enemies are already adapted to the habitat and to the target pest, and their conservation can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%.[31] Predators of aphids were similarly found to be present in tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nCropping systems can be modified to favor natural enemies, a practice sometimes referred to as habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter.[32] In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid.[33] The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cotton production, the replacement of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as Bt cotton can create a more favorable environment for natural enemies of cotton pests due to reduced insecticide exposure risk. Such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the Bt protein. Reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from Bt cotton can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases, but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in Bt and non-Bt cotton are often similar.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nPredators are mainly free-living species that directly consume a large number of prey during their whole lifetime. Given that many major crop pests are insects, many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species. Lady beetles, and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July in the northern hemisphere, are voracious predators of aphids, and also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The spotted lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe larvae of many hoverfly species principally feed upon aphids, one larva devouring up to 400 in its lifetime. Their effectiveness in commercial crops has not been studied.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral species of entomopathogenic nematode are important predators of insect and other invertebrate pests.[37] Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a microscopic nematode that kills slugs. Its complex life cycle includes a free-living, infective stage in the soil where it becomes associated with a pathogenic bacteria such as Moraxella osloensis. The nematode enters the slug through the posterior mantle region, thereafter feeding and reproducing inside, but it is the bacteria that kill the slug. The nematode is available commercially in Europe and is applied by watering onto moist soil.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecies used to control spider mites include the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis,[39] Neoseilus californicus,[40] and Amblyseius cucumeris, the predatory midge Feltiella acarisuga,[40] and a ladybird Stethorus punctillum.[40] The bug Orius insidiosus has been successfully used against the two-spotted spider mite and the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis).[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nPredators including Cactoblastis cactorum (mentioned above) can also be used to destroy invasive plant species. As another example, the poison hemlock moth (Agonopterix alstroemeriana) can be used to control poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). During its larval stage, the moth strictly consumes its host plant, poison hemlock, and can exist at hundreds of larvae per individual host plant, destroying large swathes of the hemlock.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor rodent pests, cats are effective biological control when used in conjunction with reduction of \\"harborage\\"/hiding locations.[44][45][46] While cats are effective at preventing rodent \\"population explosions\\", they are not effective for eliminating pre-existing severe infestations.[46] Barn owls are also sometimes used as biological rodent control.[47]  Although there are no quantitative studies of the effectiveness of barn owls for this purpose,[48] they are known rodent predators that can be used in addition to or instead of cats;[49][50] they can be encouraged into an area with nest boxes.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nParasitoids lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host, which is then used as a food for developing larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most insect parasitoids are wasps or flies, and many have a very narrow host range. The most important groups are the ichneumonid wasps, which mainly use caterpillars as hosts; braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids; chalcid wasps, which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species; and tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, beetle adults and larvae, and true bugs.[53]  Parasitoids are most effective at reducing pest populations when their host organisms have limited refuges to hide from them.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nEncarsia formosa is a small predatory chalcid wasp which is a parasitoid of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection over a long period of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate.[26] Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nParasitoids are among the most widely used biological control agents. Commercially, there are two types of rearing systems: short-term daily output with high production of parasitoids per day, and long-term, low daily output systems.[56] In most instances, production will need to be matched with the appropriate release dates when susceptible host species at a suitable phase of development will be available.[57] Larger production facilities produce on a yearlong basis, whereas some facilities produce only seasonally. Rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field, and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the point of use can pose problems.[58]  Shipping conditions can be too hot, and even vibrations from planes or trucks can adversely affect parasitoids.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eastern spruce budworm is an example of a destructive insect in fir and spruce forests. Birds are a natural form of biological control, but the Trichogramma minutum, a species of parasitic wasp, has been investigated as an alternative to more controversial chemical controls.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nPathogenic micro-organisms include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate their host and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur naturally, but may also be used as biological pesticides.[60] When naturally occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent in that they generally only occur as insect populations become denser.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nBacteria used for biological control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects.[62] Bacillus thuringiensis is the most widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees.[63][64] Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use.[65] If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.[66][64]\\r\\nThe bacterium Paenibacillus popilliae which causes milky spore disease has been found useful in the control of Japanese beetle, killing the larvae. It is very specific to its host species and is harmless to vertebrates and other invertebrates.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nEntomopathogenic fungi, which cause disease in insects, include at least 14 species that attack aphids.[68] Beauveria bassiana is mass-produced and used to manage a wide variety of insect pests including whiteflies, thrips, aphids and weevils.[69] Lecanicillium spp. are deployed against white flies, thrips and aphids. Metarhizium spp. are used against pests including beetles, locusts and other grasshoppers, Hemiptera, and spider mites. Paecilomyces fumosoroseus is effective against white flies, thrips and aphids; Purpureocillium lilacinus is used against root-knot nematodes, and 89 Trichoderma species against certain plant pathogens. Trichoderma viride has been used against Dutch elm disease, and has shown some effect in suppressing silver leaf, a disease of stone fruits caused by the pathogenic fungus Chondrostereum purpureum.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fungi Cordyceps and Metacordyceps are deployed against a wide spectrum of arthropods.[71]\\r\\nEntomophaga is effective against pests such as the green peach aphid.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral members of Chytridiomycota and Blastocladiomycota have been explored as agents of biological control.[73][74] From Chytridiomycota, Synchytrium solstitiale is being considered as a control agent of the yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis) in the United States.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nBaculoviruses are specific to individual insect host species and have been shown to be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nA mammalian virus, the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus was introduced to Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there.[77] It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. Very young animals survived, passing immunity to their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population.[78] Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful at first, but a decade later, immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nLagenidium giganteum is a water-borne mould that parasitizes the larval stage of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This mould has the advantages of a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legume vine Mucuna pruriens is used in the countries of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for problematic Imperata cylindrica grass: the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring plants by out-competing them for space and light. Mucuna pruriens is said not to be invasive outside its cultivated area.[81] Desmodium uncinatum can be used in push-pull farming to stop the parasitic plant, witchweed (Striga).[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian bush fly, Musca vetustissima, is a major nuisance pest in Australia, but native decomposers found in Australia are not adapted to feeding on cow dung, which is where bush flies breed. Therefore, the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965ÿ1985), led by George Bornemissza of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, released forty-nine species of dung beetle, to reduce the amount of dung and therefore also the potential breeding sites of the fly.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cases of massive and severe infection of invasive pests, techniques of pest control are often used in combination. An example is the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed tens of millions of ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer. Initial results for Tetrastichus planipennisi have shown promise, and it is now being released along with Beauveria bassiana, a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.[84][85][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the most important pests are exotic, invasive species that severely impact agriculture, horticulture, forestry and urban environments. They tend to arrive without their co-evolved\\r\\nparasites, pathogens and predators, and by escaping from these, populations may soar. Importing the natural enemies of these pests may seem a logical move but this may have unintended consequences; regulations may be ineffective and there may be unanticipated effects on biodiversity, and the adoption of the techniques may prove challenging because of a lack of knowledge among farmers and growers.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nBiological control can affect biodiversity[14] through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species.[88] An introduced control does not always target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species.[89] In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may have a negative impact on the native ecosystem; however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nVertebrate animals tend to be generalist feeders, and seldom make good biological control agents; many of the classic cases of \\"biocontrol gone awry\\" involve vertebrates. For example, the cane toad (Rhinella marina) was intentionally introduced to Australia to control the greyback cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum),[91] and other pests of sugar cane. 102 toads were obtained from Hawaii and bred in captivity to increase their numbers until they were released into the sugar cane fields of the tropic north in 1935. It was later discovered that the toads could not jump very high and so were unable to eat the cane beetles which stayed on the upper stalks of the cane plants. However, the toad thrived by feeding on other insects and soon spread very rapidly; it took over native amphibian habitat and brought foreign disease to native toads and frogs, dramatically reducing their populations. Also, when it is threatened or handled, the cane toad releases poison from parotoid glands on its shoulders; native Australian species such as goannas, tiger snakes, dingos and northern quolls that attempted to eat the toad were harmed or killed. However, there has been some recent evidence that native predators are adapting, both physiologically and through changing their behaviour, so in the long run, their populations may recover.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nRhinocyllus conicus, a seed-feeding weevil, was introduced to North America to control exotic musk thistle (Carduus nutans) and Canadian thistle (Cirsium arvense). However, the weevil also attacks native thistles, harming such species as the endemic Platte thistle (Cirsium neomexicanum) by selecting larger plants (which reduced the gene pool), reducing seed production and ultimately threatening the species' survival.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe small Asian mongoose (Herpestus javanicus) was introduced to Hawaii in order to control the rat population. However, the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; the mongoose therefore preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sturdy and prolific eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) is a native of the southeastern United States and was introduced around the world in the 1930s and '40s to feed on mosquito larvae and thus combat malaria. However, it has thrived at the expense of local species, causing a decline of endemic fish and frogs through competition for food resources, as well as through eating their eggs and larvae.[95] In Australia, control of the mosquitofish is the subject of discussion; in 1989 it was said[by whom?] that \\"biological population control is well beyond present capabilities\\", and this remains the position[by whom?].[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nA potential obstacle to the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides.[97] One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.[98]","input":"What is the meaning of biological pest control?"},{"output":"Greenbrier Valley Airport","context":"Greenbrier Valley Airport (IATA: LWB[2],?ICAO: KLWB,?FAA LID: LWB) is a public airport three?miles (5?km) north of Lewisburg in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, United States.

Digestive enzymes of diverse specificities are found in the saliva secreted by the salivary glands, in the secretions of cells lining the stomach, in the pancreatic juice secreted by pancreatic exocrine cells, and in the secretions of cells lining the small and large intestines.\\r\\nDigestive enzymes are classified based on their target substrates:\\r\\nIn the human digestive system, the main sites of digestion are the oral cavity, the stomach, and the small intestine. Digestive enzymes are secreted by different exocrine glands including:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nComplex food substances that are taken by animals and humans must be broken down into simple, soluble, and diffusible substances before they can be absorbed. In the oral cavity, salivary glands secrete an array of enzymes and substances that aid in digestion and also disinfection. They include the following:[1]\\r\\nOf note is the diversity of the salivary glands. There are two types of salivary glands:\\r\\nThe enzymes that are secreted in the stomach are called gastric enzymes. The stomach plays a major role in digestion, both in a mechanical sense by mixing and crushing the food, and also in an enzymatic sense, by digesting it. The following are enzymes produced by the stomach and their respective function:\\r\\nhormones or compounds produced by the stomach and their respective function:\\r\\nOf note is the division of function between the cells covering the stomach. There are four types of cells in the stomach:\\r\\nSecretion by the previous cells is controlled by the enteric nervous system. Distention in the stomach or innervation by the vagus nerve (via the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system) activates the ENS, in turn leading to the release of acetylcholine. Once present, acetylcholine activates G cells and parietal cells.\\r\\nPancreas is both an endocrine and an exocrine gland, in that it functions to produce endocrinic hormones released into the circulatory system (such as insulin, and glucagon), to control glucose metabolism, and also to secrete digestive/exocrinic pancreatic juice, which is secreted eventually via the pancreatic duct into duodenum.

An antigen is a molecule capable of stimulating an immune response, and is often produced by cancer cells or viruses. Antigens inside a cell are bound to class I MHC molecules, and brought to the surface of the cell by the class I MHC molecule, where they can be recognized by the T cell. If the TCR is specific for that antigen, it binds to the complex of the class I MHC molecule and the antigen, and the T cell destroys the cell.\\r\\nIn order for the TCR to bind to the class I MHC molecule, the former must be accompanied by a glycoprotein called CD8, which binds to the constant portion of the class I MHC molecule. Therefore, these T cells are called CD8+ T cells.\\r\\nThe affinity between CD8 and the MHC molecule keeps the TC cell and the target cell bound closely together during antigen-specific activation. CD8+ T cells are recognized as TC cells once they become activated and are generally classified as having a pre-defined cytotoxic role within the immune system. However, CD8+ T cells also have the ability to make some cytokines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immune system must recognize millions of potential antigens. There are fewer than 30,000 genes in the human body, so it is impossible to have one gene for every antigen. Instead, the DNA in millions of white blood cells in the bone marrow is shuffled to create cells with unique receptors, each of which can bind to a different antigen. Some receptors bind to tissues in the human body itself, so to prevent the body from attacking itself, those self-reactive white blood cells are destroyed during further development in the thymus.\\r\\nTCRs have two parts, usually an alpha and a beta chain. (Some TCRs have a gamma and a delta chain.) Hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow migrate into the thymus, where they undergo VDJ recombination of their beta-chain TCR DNA to form a developmental form of the TCR protein, known as pre-TCR. If that rearrangement is successful, the cells then rearrange their alpha-chain TCR DNA to create a functional alpha-beta TCR complex. This highly-variable genetic rearrangement product in the TCR genes helps create millions of different T cells with different TCRs, helping the body's immune system respond to virtually any protein of an invader. The vast majority of T cells express alpha-beta TCRs (ϫ T cells), but some T cells in epithelial tissues (like the gut) express gamma-delta TCRs (Ѵ T cells), which recognize non-protein antigens.\\r\\nT cells with functionally stable TCRs express both the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors and are therefore termed \\"double-positive\\" (DP) T cells (CD4+CD8+). The double-positive T cells are exposed to a wide variety of self-antigens in the thymus and undergo two selection criteria:\\r\\nOnly those T cells that bind to the MHC-self-antigen complexes weakly are positively selected. Those cells that survive positive and negative selection differentiate into single-positive T cells (either CD4+ or CD8+), depending on whether their TCR recognizes an MHC class I-presented antigen (CD8) or an MHC class II-presented antigen (CD4). It is the CD8+ T-cells that will mature and go on to become cytotoxic T cells following their activation with a class I-restricted antigen.\\r\\nWith an exception of some cell types, such as non-nucleated cells (including erythrocytes), Class I MHC is expressed by all host cells. When these cells are infected with a virus (or another intracellular pathogen), the cells degrade foreign proteins via antigen processing. These result in peptide fragments, some of which are presented by MHC Class I to the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) on CD8+ T cells.\\r\\nThe activation of cytotoxic T cells is dependent on several simultaneous interactions between molecules expressed on the surface of the T cell and molecules on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell (APC). For instance, consider the two signal model for TC cell activation.\\r\\nA simple activation of naive CD8+ T cells requires the interaction with professional antigen-presenting cells, mainly with matured dendritic cells. To generate longlasting memory T cells and to allow repetitive stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, dendritic cells have to interact with both, activated CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ T cells.[1][2] During this process, the CD4+ helper T cells \\"license\\" the dendritic cells to give a potent activating signal to the naive CD8+ T cells.\\r\\nWhile in most cases activation is dependent on TCR recognition of antigen, alternative pathways for activation have been described. For example, cytotoxic T cells have been shown to become activated when targeted by other CD8 T cells leading to tolerization of the latter.[3]\\r\\nOnce activated, the TC cell undergoes clonal expansion with the help of the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is a growth and differentiation factor for T cells. This increases the number of cells specific for the target antigen that can then travel throughout the body in search of antigen-positive somatic cells.\\r\\nWhen exposed to infected/dysfunctional somatic cells, TC cells release the cytotoxins perforin, granzymes, and granulysin. Through the action of perforin, granzymes enter the cytoplasm of the target cell and their serine protease function triggers the caspase cascade, which is a series of cysteine proteases that eventually lead to apoptosis (programmed cell death).\\r\\nA second way to induce apoptosis is via cell-surface interaction between the TC and the infected cell. When a TC is activated it starts to express the surface protein FAS ligand (FasL)(Apo1L)(CD95L), which can bind to Fas (Apo1)(CD95) molecules expressed on the target cell. However, this Fas-Fas ligand interaction is thought to be more important to the disposal of unwanted T lymphocytes during their development or to the lytic activity of certain TH cells than it is to the cytolytic activity of TC effector cells. Engagement of Fas with FasL allows for recruitment of the death-induced signaling complex (DISC).[4] The Fas-associated death domain (FADD) translocates with the DISC, allowing recruitment of procaspases 8 and 10.[5] These caspases then activate the effector caspases 3, 6, and 7, leading to cleavage of death substrates such as lamin A, lamin B1, lamin B2, PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase), and DNAPK (DNA-activated protein kinase). The final result is apoptosis of the cell that expressed Fas.\\r\\nDuring hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection cytotoxic T cells play an important pathogenetic role. They contribute to nearly all of the liver injury associated with HBV infection and, by killing infected cells and by producing antiviral cytokines capable of purging HBV from viable hepatocytes, cytotoxic T cells also eliminate the virus.[6] Platelets have been shown to facilitate the accumulation of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells into the infected liver.[7]\\r\\nCytotoxic T cells have been implicated in the progression of arthritis: depletion of knee joint cartilage macromolecules such as glycosaminoglycans by cytotoxic T cells and macrophages has been observed in a rat model of the disease.[8]","input":"What is the role of cytotoxic t cells?"},{"output":"typically 10 ÿ 12 weeks","context":"","input":"How many weeks are in a college quarter?"},{"output":"the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh","context":"The history of Uttar Pradesh the Northern Indian state, stretches back technically to its formation on 1 April 1937 as the North-Western Provinces of Agra and Awadh, but the region itself shows the presence of human habitation dating back to between 85,000 and 73,000 years ago.

The kingdom of the Kurus corresponds to the Black and Red Ware and Painted Gray Ware culture and the beginning of the Iron Age in North-west India, around 1000 BC.[12]\\r\\nMost of the invaders of south India passed through the Gangetic plains of what is today Uttar Pradesh. Control over this region was of vital importance to the power and stability of all of India's major empires, including the Maurya (320ÿ200 BC), Kushan (100ÿ250?CE), Gupta (350ÿ600 CE), and Gurjara-Pratihara (650ÿ1036 CE) empires.[14] Following the Huns invasions that broke the Gupta empire, the Ganges-Yamuna Doab saw the rise of Kannauj.[15] During the reign of Harshavardhana (590ÿ647), the Kannauj empire reached its zenith.[15] It spanned from Punjab in the north and Gujarat in the west to Bengal in the east and Odisha in the south.[12] It included parts of central India, north of the Narmada River and it encompassed the entire Indo-Gangetic plain.[16] Many communities in various parts of India claim descent from the migrants of Kannauj.[17] Soon after Harshavardhana's death, his empire disintegrated into many kingdoms, which were invaded and ruled by the Gurjara-Pratihara empire, which challenged Bengal's Pala Empire for control of the region.[16] Kannauj was several times invaded by the south Indian Rashtrakuta Dynasty from the 8th century to the 10th century.[18][19]\\r\\nIn the 16th century, Babur, a Timurid descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan from Fergana Valley (modern-day Uzbekistan), swept across the Khyber Pass and founded the Mughal Empire, covering India, along with modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh[20] The Mughals were descended from Persianised Central Asian Turks (with significant Mongol admixture). In the Mughal era, Uttar Pradesh became the heartland of the empire.[17] Mughal emperors Babur and Humayun ruled from Agra.[21][22] In 1540 an Afghan, Sher Shah Suri, took over the reins of Uttar Pradesh after defeating the Mughal king Humanyun.[23] Sher Shah and his son Islam Shah ruled Uttar Pradesh from their capital at Gwalior.[24] After the death of Islam Shah Suri, his prime minister Hemu became the de facto ruler of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and the western parts of Bengal. He was bestowed the title of Vikramaditya at his coronation in Purana Quila in Delhi. Hemu died in the Second Battle of Panipat, and Uttar Pradesh came under Emperor Akbar's rule.[25] Akbar ruled from Agra and Fatehpur Sikri.[26] In the 18th century, after the fall of Mughal authority, the power vacuum was filled by the Maratha Empire, in the mid 18th century, the Maratha army invaded the Uttar Pradesh region, which resulted in Rohillas losing control of Rohillkhand to the Maratha rulers Raghunath Rao and Malharao Holkar. The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18?December 1788 with the arrest of Ghulam Qadir, the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general Mahadaji Scindia. In 1803, following the Second Anglo-Maratha War, when the British East India Company defeated the Maratha Empire, much of the region came under British suzerainty.[27]\\r\\nStarting from Bengal in the second half of the 18th century, a series of battles for north Indian lands finally gave the British East India Company accession over the state's territories.[28] Ajmer and Jaipur kingdoms were also included in this northern territory, which was named the \\"North-Western Provinces\\" (of Agra). Although UP later became the fifth largest state of India, NWPA was one of the smallest states of the British Indian empire.[29] Its capital shifted twice between Agra and Allahabad.[citation needed]\\r\\nDue to dissatisfaction with British rule, a serious rebellion erupted in various parts of North India; Bengal regiment's sepoy stationed at Meerut cantonment, Mangal Pandey, is widely credited as its starting point.[30] It came to be known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857. After the revolt failed, the British attempted to divide the most rebellious regions by reorganising the administrative boundaries of the region, splitting the Delhi region from 'NWFP of Agra' and merging it with Punjab, while the Ajmer- Marwar region was merged with Rajputana and Oudh was incorporated into the state. The new state was called the 'North Western Provinces of Agra and Oudh', which in 1902 was renamed as the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.[31] It was commonly referred to as the United Provinces or its acronym UP.[32][33]\\r\\nIn 1920, the capital of the province was shifted from Allahabad to Lucknow. The high court continued to be at Allahabad, but a bench was established at Lucknow. Allahabad continues to be an important administrative base of today's Uttar Pradesh and has several administrative headquarters.[34] Uttar Pradesh continued to be central to Indian politics and was especially important in modern Indian history as a hotbed of the Indian independence movement. Uttar Pradesh hosted modern educational institutions such as the Benaras Hindu University, Aligarh Muslim University and the Darul Uloom Deoband. Nationally known figures such as Chandra Shekhar Azad were among the leaders of the movement in Uttar Pradesh, and Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Madan Mohan Malaviya and Gobind Ballabh Pant were important national leaders of the Indian National Congress. The All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) was formed at the Lucknow session of the Congress on 11 April 1936, with the famous nationalist Swami Sahajanand Saraswati elected as its first President,[35] in order to address the longstanding grievances of the peasantry and mobilise them against the zamindari landlords attacks on their occupancy rights, thus sparking the Farmers movements in India.[36] During the Quit India Movement of 1942, Ballia district overthrew the colonial authority and installed an independent administration under Chittu Pandey. Ballia became known as \\"Baghi Ballia\\" (Rebel Ballia) for this significant role in India's independence movement.[37]\\r\\nAfter India's independence, the United Provinces were reorganised as Uttar Pradesh in 1957. The state has provided seven of India's prime ministers and is the source of the largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha. Despite its political influence, its poor economic development and administrative record, organised crime and corruption kept it amongst India's backward states. The state has been affected by repeated episodes of caste and communal violence.[38] In 1999, northern districts of the state were separated to form the state of Uttarakhand.[39]\\r\\nFor Palelithic & Neolithic period:\\r\\nFor Copper Hoard culture:\\r\\nFor Painted Grey Ware culture:\\r\\nFor Cemetery H culture:\\r\\nFor Vedic Period:\\r\\nFor Indo-Schynthians\\r\\nFor Kushans:","input":"What was the state of uttar pradesh known as before independence?"},{"output":"13 October 1983","context":"The history of mobile phones covers mobile communication devices that connect wirelessly to the public switched telephone network.\\r\\nWhile the transmission of speech by radio has a long history, the first devices that were wireless, mobile, and also capable of connecting to the standard telephone network are much more recent. The first such devices were barely portable compared to today's compact hand-held devices, and their use was clumsy.\\r\\nAlong with the process of developing a more portable technology, and a better interconnections system, drastic changes have taken place in both the networking of wireless communication and the prevalence of its use, with smartphones becoming common globally and a growing proportion of Internet access now done via mobile broadband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the devices existed that are now referred to as mobile phones or cell phones, there were some precursors. In 1908, a Professor Albert Jahnke and the Oakland Transcontinental Aerial Telephone and Power Company claimed to have developed a wireless telephone. They were accused of fraud and the charge was then dropped, but they do not seem to have proceeded with production.[2] Beginning in 1918, the German railroad system tested wireless telephony on military trains between Berlin and Zossen.[3] In 1924, public trials started with telephone connection on trains between Berlin and Hamburg. In 1925, the company Zugtelephonie AG was founded to supply train telephony equipment and, in 1926, telephone service in trains of the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the German mail service on the route between Hamburg and Berlin was approved and offered to first-class travelers.[4]\\r\\nFiction anticipated the development of real world mobile telephones. In 1906, the English caricaturist Lewis Baumer published a cartoon in Punch magazine entitled \\"Forecasts for 1907\\" in which he showed a man and a woman in London's Hyde Park each separately engaged in gambling and dating on wireless telephony equipment.[5] Then, in 1926, the artist Karl Arnold created a visionary cartoon about the use of mobile phones in the street, in the picture \\"wireless telephony\\", published in the German satirical magazine Simplicissimus.[6]\\r\\nThe Second World War made military use of radio telephony links. Hand-held radio transceivers have been available since the 1940s. Mobile telephones for automobiles became available from some telephone companies in the 1940s. Early devices were bulky, consumed high power, and the network supported only a few simultaneous conversations. Modern cellular networks allow automatic and pervasive use of mobile phones for voice and data communications.\\r\\nIn the United States, engineers from Bell Labs began work on a system to allow mobile users to place and receive telephone calls from automobiles, leading to the inauguration of mobile service on 17 June 1946 in St. Louis, Missouri. Shortly after, AT&T offered Mobile Telephone Service. A wide range of mostly incompatible mobile telephone services offered limited coverage area and only a few available channels in urban areas. The introduction of cellular technology, which allowed re-use of frequencies many times in small adjacent areas covered by relatively low powered transmitters, made widespread adoption of mobile telephones economically feasible.\\r\\nIn the USSR, Leonid Kupriyanovich, an engineer from Moscow, in 1957-1961 developed and presented a number of experimental pocket-sized communications radio. The weight of one model, presented in 1961, was only 70 g and could fit on a palm.[7][8] However, in the USSR the decision at first to develop the system of the automobile \\"Altai\\" phone was made.[9]\\r\\nIn 1965, Bulgarian company \\"Radioelektronika\\" presented on the Inforga-65 international exhibition in Moscow the mobile automatic phone combined with a base station. Solutions of this phone were based on a system developed by Leonid Kupriyanovich. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to 15 customers.[10]\\r\\nThe advances in mobile telephony can be traced in successive generations from the early \\"0G\\" services like MTS and its successor Improved Mobile Telephone Service, to first-generation (1G) analog cellular network, second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks, third-generation (3G) broadband data services to the state-of-the-art, fourth-generation (4G) native-IP networks.\\r\\nIn 1949, AT&T commercialized Mobile Telephone Service. From its start in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1946, AT&T introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about 30,000 calls each week. Calls were set up manually by an operator and the user had to depress a button on the handset to talk and release the button to listen. The call subscriber equipment weighed about 80 pounds (36?kg)[11]\\r\\nSubscriber growth and revenue generation were hampered by the constraints of the technology. Because only three radio channels were available, only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time.[12] Mobile Telephone Service was expensive, costing 15 USD per month, plus 0.30 to 0.40 USD per local call, equivalent to about 176 USD per month and 3.50 to 4.75 per call in 2012 USD.[11]\\r\\nIn the UK, there was also a vehicle-based system called \\"Post Office Radiophone Service,\\"[13] which was launched around the city of Manchester in 1959, and although it required callers to speak to an operator, it was possible to be put through to any subscriber in Great Britain. The service was extended to London in 1965 and other major cities in 1972.\\r\\nAT&T introduced the first major improvement to mobile telephony in 1965, giving the improved service the obvious name of Improved Mobile Telephone Service. IMTS used additional radio channels, allowing more simultaneous calls in a given geographic area, introduced customer dialing, eliminating manual call setup by an operator, and reduced the size and weight of the subscriber equipment.[11]\\r\\nDespite the capacity improvement offered by IMTS, demand outstripped capacity. In agreement with state regulatory agencies, AT&T limited the service to just 40,000 customers system wide. In New York City, for example, 2,000 customers shared just 12 radio channels and typically had to wait 30 minutes to place a call.[11]\\r\\nRadio Common Carrier[14] or RCC was a service introduced in the 1960s by independent telephone companies to compete against AT&T's IMTS. RCC systems used paired UHF 454/459?MHz and VHF 152/158?MHz frequencies near those used by IMTS. RCC based services were provided until the 1980s when cellular AMPS systems made RCC equipment obsolete.\\r\\nSome RCC systems were designed to allow customers of adjacent carriers to use their facilities, but equipment used by RCCs did not allow the equivalent of modern \\"roaming\\" because technical standards were not uniform. For example, the phone of an Omaha, Nebraskaÿbased RCC service would not be likely to work in Phoenix, Arizona. Roaming was not encouraged, in part, because there was no centralized industry billing database for RCCs. Signaling formats were not standardized. For example, some systems used two-tone sequential paging to alert a mobile of an incoming call. Other systems used DTMF. Some used Secode 2805, which transmitted an interrupted 2805?Hz tone (similar to IMTS signaling) to alert mobiles of an offered call. Some radio equipment used with RCC systems was half-duplex, push-to-talk LOMO equipment such as Motorola hand-helds or RCA 700-series conventional two-way radios. Other vehicular equipment had telephone handsets and rotary dials or pushbutton pads, and operated full duplex like a conventional wired telephone. A few users had full-duplex briefcase telephones (radically advanced for their day)\\r\\nAt the end of RCC's existence, industry associations were working on a technical standard that would have allowed roaming, and some mobile users had multiple decoders to enable operation with more than one of the common signaling formats (600/1500, 2805, and Reach). Manual operation was often a fallback for RCC roamers.\\r\\nIn 1969 Penn Central Railroad equipped commuter trains along the 360 kilometres (220?mi) New York-Washington route with special pay phones that allowed passengers to place telephone calls while the train was moving. The system re-used six frequencies in the 450?MHz band in nine sites.[12]\\r\\nIn the UK, Channel Islands and elsewhere the \\"Rabbit\\" phone system was briefly used, being a hybrid of \\"cell\\" base stations and handsets. One major limitation was that you had to be less than 300 feet (closer with buildings) from a base due to power limitations on a portable device. [15][better?source?needed] With modern technology a similar variant is being considered for Apple's new 4G \\"smart watch\\" so they can be used in large events in a broadly similar way to a femtocell.\\r\\nIn Europe, several mutually incompatible mobile radio services were developed.\\r\\nIn 1966 Norway had a system called OLT which was manually controlled. Finland's ARP, launched in 1971, was also manual as was the Swedish MTD. All were replaced by the automatic NMT, (Nordic Mobile Telephone) system in the early 1980s.\\r\\nIn July 1971 Readycall was introduced in London by Burndept after obtaining a special concession to break the Post Office monopoly to allow selective calling to mobiles of calls from the public telephone system. This system was available to the public for a subscription of S16 month. A year later the service was extended to two other UK towns.[16]\\r\\nWest Germany had a network called A-Netz launched in 1952 as the country's first public commercial mobile phone network. In 1972 this was displaced by B-Netz which connected calls automatically.\\r\\nIn December 1947, Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young, Bell Labs engineers, proposed hexagonal cells for mobile phones in vehicles.[17] At this stage, the technology to implement these ideas did not exist, nor had the frequencies been allocated. Two decades would pass before Richard H. Frenkiel, Joel S. Engel and Philip T. Porter of Bell Labs expanded the early proposals into a much more detailed system plan. It was Porter who first proposed that the cell towers use the now-familiar directional antennas to reduce interference and increase channel reuse (see picture at right)[18] Porter also invented the dial-then-send method used by all cell phones to reduce wasted channel time.\\r\\nIn all these early examples, a mobile phone had to stay within the coverage area serviced by one base station throughout the phone call, i.e. there was no continuity of service as the phones moved through several cell areas. The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff, as well as a number of other concepts that formed the basis of modern cell phone technology, were described in the late 1960s, in papers by Frenkiel and Porter. In 1970 Amos E. Joel, Jr., a Bell Labs engineer,[19] invented a \\"three-sided trunk circuit\\" to aid in the \\"call handoff\\" process from one cell to another. His patent contained an early description of the Bell Labs cellular concept, but as switching systems became faster, such a circuit became unnecessary and was never implemented in a system.\\r\\nA cellular telephone switching plan was described by Fluhr and Nussbaum in 1973,[20] and a cellular telephone data signaling system was described in hipatitas by Hachenburg et al.[21]\\r\\nThe first fully automated mobile phone system for vehicles was launched in Sweden in 1956. Named MTA (Mobiltelefonisystem A), it allowed calls to be made and received in the car using a rotary dial. The car phone could also be paged. Calls from the car were direct dial, whereas incoming calls required an operator to locate the nearest base station to the car. It was developed by Sture Laurn and other engineers at Televerket network operator. Ericsson provided the switchboard while Svenska Radioaktiebolaget (SRA) and Marconi provided the telephones and base station equipment. MTA phones consisted of vacuum tubes and relays, and weighed 40 kilograms (88?lb). In 1962, an upgraded version called Mobile System B (MTB) was introduced. This was a push-button telephone, and used transistors and DTMF signaling to improve its operational reliability. In 1971 the MTD version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success.[22][23] The network remained open until 1983 and still had 600 customers when it closed.\\r\\nIn 1958 development began on a similar system for motorists in the USSR.[24] The \\"Altay\\" national civil mobile phone service was based on Soviet MRT-1327 standard. The main developers of the Altay system were the Voronezh Science Research Institute of Communications (VNIIS) and the State Specialized Project Institute (GSPI). In 1963 the service started in Moscow, and by 1970 was deployed in 30 cities across the USSR. Versions of the Altay system are still in use today as a trunking system in some parts of Russia.\\r\\nIn 1959 a private telephone company in Brewster, Kansas, USA, the S&T Telephone Company, (still in business today) with the use of Motorola Radio Telephone equipment and a private tower facility, offered to the public mobile telephone services in that local area of NW Kansas. This system was a direct dial up service through their local switchboard, and was installed in many private vehicles including grain combines, trucks, and automobiles. For some as yet unknown reason, the system, after being placed online and operated for a very brief time period, was shut down. The management of the company was immediately changed, and the fully operable system and related equipment was immediately dismantled in early 1960, not to be seen again.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1966, Bulgaria presented the pocket mobile automatic phone RAT-0,5 combined with a base station RATZ-10 (RATC-10) on Interorgtechnika-66 international exhibition. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to six customers (\\"Radio\\" magazine, 2, 1967; \\"Novosti dnya\\" newsreel, 37, 1966).\\r\\nOne of the first successful public commercial mobile phone networks was the ARP network in Finland, launched in 1971. Posthumously, ARP is sometimes viewed as a zero generation (0G) cellular network, being slightly above previous proprietary and limited coverage networks.[citation needed]\\r\\nPrior to 1973, mobile telephony was limited to phones installed in cars and other vehicles.[19] Motorola was the first company to produce a handheld mobile phone. On April 3, 1973, Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, made the first mobile telephone call from handheld subscriber equipment, placing a call to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs, his rival.[25][26][27] The prototype handheld phone used by Dr. Cooper weighed 1.1 kilograms (2.4?lb) and measured 23 by 13 by 4.5 centimetres (9.1 by 5.1 by 1.8?in). The prototype offered a talk time of just 30 minutes and took 10 hours to re-charge.[28]\\r\\nJohn F. Mitchell,[29][30][31] Motorola's chief of portable communication products and Cooper's boss in 1973, played a key role in advancing the development of handheld mobile telephone equipment. Mitchell successfully pushed Motorola to develop wireless communication products that would be small enough to use anywhere and participated in the design of the cellular phone.[32][33]\\r\\nNewer technology has been developed and rolled out in a series of waves or generations. The \\"generation\\" terminology only became widely used when 3G was launched, but is now used retroactively when referring to the earlier systems.\\r\\nFirst automatic analogue cellular systems deployed were NTT's system first used in Tokyo in 1979, later spreading to the whole of Japan, and NMT in the Nordic countries in 1981.\\r\\nThe first analogue cellular system widely deployed in North America was the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS).[34] It was commercially introduced in the Americas in 13 October 1983, Israel in 1986, and Australia in 1987. AMPS was a pioneering technology that helped drive mass market usage of cellular technology, but it had several serious issues by modern standards. It was unencrypted and easily vulnerable to eavesdropping via a scanner; it was susceptible to cell phone \\"cloning\\" and it used a Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) scheme and required significant amounts of wireless spectrum to support.\\r\\nOn 6 March 1983, the DynaTAC 8000X mobile phone launched on the first US 1G network by Ameritech. It cost $100m to develop, and took over a decade to reach the market.[35] The phone had a talk time of just thirty-five minutes and took ten hours to charge. Consumer demand was strong despite the battery life, weight, and low talk time, and waiting lists were in the thousands.[36][37]\\r\\nMany of the iconic early commercial cell phones such as the Motorola DynaTAC Analog AMPS were eventually superseded by Digital AMPS (D-AMPS) in 1990, and AMPS service was shut down by most North American carriers by 2008.\\r\\nIn February 1986 Australia launched its Cellular Telephone System by Telecom Australia. Peter Reedman was the first Telecom Customer to be connected on 6 January 1986 along with five other subscribers as test customers prior to the official launch date of 28 February.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the 'second generation' mobile phone systems emerged. Two systems competed for supremacy in the global market: the European developed GSM standard and the U.S. developed CDMA standard. These differed from the previous generation by using digital instead of analog transmission, and also fast out-of-band phone-to-network signaling. The rise in mobile phone usage as a result of 2G was explosive and this era also saw the advent of prepaid mobile phones.\\r\\nIn 1991 the first GSM network (Radiolinja) launched in Finland. In general the frequencies used by 2G systems in Europe were higher than those in America, though with some overlap. For example, the 900?MHz frequency range was used for both 1G and 2G systems in Europe, so the 1G systems were rapidly closed down to make space for the 2G systems. In America the IS-54 standard was deployed in the same band as AMPS and displaced some of the existing analog channels.\\r\\nIn 1993, IBM Simon was introduced. This was possibly the world's first smartphone. It was a mobile phone, pager, fax machine, and PDA all rolled into one. It included a calendar, address book, clock, calculator, notepad, email, and a touchscreen with a QWERTY keyboard.[38] The IBM Simon had a stylus you used to tap the touch screen with. It featured predictive typing that would guess the next characters as you tapped. It had applications, or at least a way to deliver more features by plugging a PCMCIA 1.8 MB memory card into the phone.[39] Coinciding with the introduction of 2G systems was a trend away from the larger \\"brick\\" phones toward tiny 100ÿ200 grams (3.5ÿ7.1?oz) hand-held devices. This change was possible not only through technological improvements such as more advanced batteries and more energy-efficient electronics, but also because of the higher density of cell sites to accommodate increasing usage. The latter meant that the average distance transmission from phone to the base station shortened, leading to increased battery life while on the move.\\r\\nThe second generation introduced a new variant of communication called SMS or text messaging. It was initially available only on GSM networks but spread eventually on all digital networks. The first machine-generated SMS message was sent in the UK on 3 December 1992 followed in 1993 by the first person-to-person SMS sent in Finland. The advent of prepaid services in the late 1990s soon made SMS the communication method of choice among the young, a trend which spread across all ages.\\r\\n2G also introduced the ability to access media content on mobile phones. In 1998 the first downloadable content sold to mobile phones was the ring tone, launched by Finland's Radiolinja (now Elisa). Advertising on the mobile phone first appeared in Finland when a free daily SMS news headline service was launched in 2000, sponsored by advertising.\\r\\nMobile payments were trialed in 1998 in Finland and Sweden where a mobile phone was used to pay for a Coca-Cola vending machine and car parking. Commercial launches followed in 1999 in Norway. The first commercial payment system to mimic banks and credit cards was launched in the Philippines in 1999 simultaneously by mobile operators Globe and Smart.\\r\\nThe first full internet service on mobile phones was introduced by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in 1999.\\r\\nAs the use of 2G phones became more widespread and people began to use mobile phones in their daily lives, it became clear that demand for data (such as access to browse the internet) was growing. Further, experience from fixed broadband services showed there would also be an ever-increasing demand for greater data speeds. The 2G technology was nowhere near up to the job, so the industry began to work on the next generation of technology known as 3G. The main technological difference that distinguishes 3G technology from 2G technology is the use of packet switching rather than circuit switching for data transmission.[40] In addition, the standardization process focused on requirements more than technology (2 Mbit/s maximum data rate indoors, 384 kbit/s outdoors, for example).\\r\\nInevitably this led to many competing standards with different contenders pushing their own technologies, and the vision of a single unified worldwide standard looked far from reality. The standard 2G CDMA networks became 3G compliant with the adoption of Revision A to EV-DO, which made several additions to the protocol while retaining backwards compatibility:\\r\\nAll these were put in place to allow for low latency, low bit rate communications such as VoIP.[41]\\r\\nThe first pre-commercial trial network with 3G was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in the Tokyo region in May 2001. NTT DoCoMo launched the first commercial 3G network on 1 October 2001, using the WCDMA technology. In 2002 the first 3G networks on the rival CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology were launched by SK Telecom and KTF in South Korea, and Monet in the US. Monet has since gone bankrupt. By the end of 2002, the second WCDMA network was launched in Japan by Vodafone KK (now Softbank). European launches of 3G were in Italy and the UK by Three/Hutchison group, on WCDMA. 2003 saw a further eight commercial launches of 3G, six more on WCDMA and two more on the EV-DO standard.\\r\\nDuring the development of 3G systems, 2.5G systems such as CDMA2000 1x and GPRS were developed as extensions to existing 2G networks. These provide some of the features of 3G without fulfilling the promised high data rates or full range of multimedia services. CDMA2000-1X delivers theoretical maximum data speeds of up to 307 kbit/s. Just beyond these is the EDGE system which in theory covers the requirements for 3G system, but is so narrowly above these that any practical system would be sure to fall short.\\r\\nThe high connection speeds of 3G technology enabled a transformation in the industry: for the first time, media streaming of radio (and even television) content to 3G handsets became possible,[42] with companies such as RealNetworks[43] and Disney[44] among the early pioneers in this type of offering.\\r\\nIn the mid-2000s (decade), an evolution of 3G technology began to be implemented, namely High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA). It is an enhanced 3G (third generation) mobile telephony communications protocol in the High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) family, also coined 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G, which allows networks based on Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity. Current HSDPA deployments support down-link speeds of 1.8, 3.6, 7.2 and 14.0 Mbit/s.\\r\\nBy the end of 2007, there were 295 million subscribers on 3G networks worldwide, which reflected 9% of the total worldwide subscriber base. About two thirds of these were on the WCDMA standard and one third on the EV-DO standard. The 3G telecoms services generated over $120 billion of revenues during 2007 and at many markets the majority of new phones activated were 3G phones. In Japan and South Korea the market no longer supplies phones of the second generation.\\r\\nAlthough mobile phones had long had the ability to access data networks such as the Internet, it was not until the widespread availability of good quality 3G coverage in the mid-2000s (decade) that specialized devices appeared to access the mobile web. The first such devices, known as \\"dongles\\", plugged directly into a computer through the USB port. Another new class of device appeared subsequently, the so-called \\"compact wireless router\\" such as the Novatel MiFi, which makes 3G Internet connectivity available to multiple computers simultaneously over Wi-Fi, rather than just to a single computer via a USB plug-in.\\r\\nSuch devices became especially popular for use with laptop computers due to the added portability they bestow. Consequently, some computer manufacturers started to embed the mobile data function directly into the laptop so a dongle or MiFi wasn't needed. Instead, the SIM card could be inserted directly into the device itself to access the mobile data services. Such 3G-capable laptops became commonly known as \\"netbooks\\". Other types of data-aware devices followed in the netbook's footsteps. By the beginning of 2010, E-readers, such as the Amazon Kindle and the Nook from Barnes & Noble, had already become available with embedded wireless Internet, and Apple had announced plans for embedded wireless Internet on its iPad tablet devices later that year.\\r\\nBy 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications like streaming media.[45] Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized 4th-generation technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to 10-fold over existing 3G technologies. The first two commercially available technologies billed as 4G were the WiMAX standard (offered in the U.S. by Sprint) and the LTE standard, first offered in Scandinavia by TeliaSonera.\\r\\nOne of the main ways in which 4G differed technologically from 3G was in its elimination of circuit switching, instead employing an all-IP network. Thus, 4G ushered in a treatment of voice calls just like any other type of streaming audio media, utilizing packet switching over Internet, LAN or WAN networks via VoIP.[46]\\r\\nBefore a universal charger standard was agreed upon in the late 2000s users needed an adaptor which was often the same brand as their phone to recharge the battery.\\r\\nAs of 14?June?2007[update], all new mobile phones applying for a license in China are required to use a USB port as a power port for battery charging.[48][49] This was the first standard to use the convention of shorting D+ and D?.[50]\\r\\nIn September 2007, the Open Mobile Terminal Platform group (a forum of mobile network operators and manufacturers such as Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and LG) announced that its members had agreed on Micro-USB as the future common connector for mobile devices.[51][52]\\r\\nThe GSM Association (GSMA) followed suit on 17 February 2009,[53][53][54][55][56] and on 22 April 2009, this was further endorsed by the CTIA ÿ The Wireless Association,[57] with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) announcing on 22 October 2009 that it had also embraced the Universal Charging Solution as its \\"energy-efficient one-charger-fits-all new mobile phone solution,\\" and added: \\"Based on the Micro-USB interface, UCS chargers will also include a 4-star or higher efficiency ratingup to three times more energy-efficient than an unrated charger.\\"[58]\\r\\nIn June 2009, many of the world's largest mobile phone manufacturers signed an EC-sponsored Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), agreeing to make most data-enabled mobile phones marketed in the European Union compatible with a common External Power Supply (common EPS). The EU's common EPS specification (EN 62684:2010) references the USB Battery Charging Specification and is similar to the GSMA/OMTP and Chinese charging solutions.[59][60] In January 2011, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) released its version of the (EU's) common EPS standard as IEC 62684:2011.[61]\\r\\nAs well as the now-common cellular phone, there is also the very different approach of connecting directly from the handset to an Earth-orbiting satellite. Such mobile phones can be used in remote areas out of reach of wired networks or where construction of a cellular network is uneconomic.\\r\\nThe Inmarsat system is the oldest, originally developed in 1979 for safety of life at sea, and uses a series of satellites in geostationary orbits to cover the majority of the globe. Several smaller operators use the same approach with just one or two satellites to provide a regional service. An alternative approach is to use a series of low Earth orbit satellites much closer to Earth. This is the basis of the Iridium and Globalstar satellite phone services.","input":"When were cell phones made available to the public?"},{"output":"Ceres","context":"The following is a collection of lists of exceptional asteroids in the Solar System.

Prior to this, they are known only by their systematic name or provisional designation, such as 1950 DA.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimating the sizes of asteroids from observations is difficult due to their irregular shapes, varying albedo, and small angular diameter. For example, pure C-type asteroids are much darker than most. Asteroids with only one or two axes measured may have a falsely inflated geometric mean diameter if the unknown second or third axis is significantly smaller than the primary axis. Asteroid 16 Psyche has an IRAS diameter of 253?km, yet has a more recent and accurate geometric mean of only 186?km.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of bodies grows rapidly as the size decreases. Based on IRAS data there are about 140 main-belt asteroids with a diameter greater than 120?km.[3]  For a more complete list, see List of Solar System objects by size.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inner asteroid belt (defined as the region interior to the 3:1 Kirkwood gap at 2.50 AU) has few large asteroids. Of those in the above list, only 4 Vesta, 19 Fortuna, 6 Hebe, 7 Iris and 9 Metis  orbit there.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow are the nineteen most massive measured asteroids.[4] The masses of asteroids are calculated from perturbations they induce on the orbits of other asteroids, except for asteroids that have been visited by spacecraft or have an observable moon, where a direct mass determination is possible. Different sets of astrometric observations lead to different mass determinations; the biggest problem is accounting for the aggregate perturbations caused by all of the smaller asteroids.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n(All the data above are from Baer et al. 2011, apart from 48 Doris and 532 Herculina, which are Kochetova, 2004. The proportions assume that the total mass is 3.0G1021 kg, or 6991150000000000000?(15.0I1.0)G10?10 M?.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant uncertainties remain. For example, the uncertainty in the estimate of 31 Euphrosyne is enough for its low end to overlap with both 704 Interamnia and 511 Davida, which overlap each other and also with 532 Herculina, which overlaps with 15 Eunomia and 3 Juno. Juno barely overlaps 52 Europa, which in turn overlaps with 16 Psyche. That is, outside the top four, the order of all the asteroids is uncertain. However, none of the lesser asteroids, of which the most massive are thought to be 88 Thisbe (at 17ÿ19G1018 kg), 7 Iris, 29 Amphitrite and 48 Doris (all in the range of 15G1018 kg), overlap with Europa or Psyche, so the first 12 asteroids in the chart above are likely to be the top dozen unless a hitherto unmeasured asteroid proves to be unexpectedly massive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest asteroids with an accurately measured mass, due to the fact that they have been (and are being) studied by the probe Dawn, are 1 Ceres with a mass of 939.3I0.5G1018 kg, and 4 Vesta at 259.076I0.001G1018 kg. The third-largest asteroid with an accurately measured mass, due to the fact that it has moons, is 87 Sylvia at 14.78I0.06G1018 kg.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a more complete list, see List of Solar System objects by size. Other large asteroids such as 423 Diotima currently only have estimated masses.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly Vesta regularly attains a brightness sufficient to be visible to the naked eye. The following asteroids can all reach an apparent magnitude brighter than or equal to the +8.3 attained by Saturn's moon Titan at its brightest, which was discovered 145?years before the first asteroid was found owing to its closeness to the easily observed Saturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of the asteroids in the outer part of the asteroid belt can ever attain this brightness. Even Hygiea and Interamnia rarely reach magnitudes of above 10.0. This is due to the different distribution of spectral types within different sections of the asteroid belt being such that the highest-albedo asteroids are all concentrated closer to Mars, and much lower albedo C and D types being common in the outer belt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose asteroids with very high eccentricities will only reach their maximum magnitude on unusual occasions when their perihelion is very close to a heliocentric conjunction with Earth, or (in the case of 99942 Apophis) when the asteroid passes very close to Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Apophis will only achieve that brightness on April 13, 2029.[10][11]  It typically has an apparent magnitude of 20ÿ22.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis list contains the slowest-rotating known minor planets with a period of at least 1000 hours, or 41?2?3 days, while most bodies have rotation periods between 2 and 20 hours. Also see Potentially slow rotators for minor planets with an insufficiently accurate period (U < 2).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis list contains the fastest-rotating minor planets with a period of less than 100 seconds, or 0.027 hours. Bodies with a highly uncertain period, having a quality of less than 2, are highlighted in dark-grey. The fastest rotating bodies are all unnumbered near-Earth objects (NEOs) with a diameter of less than 100 meters (see table).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the numbered minor planets with an unambiguous period solution are (459872) 2014 EK24, a 60-meter sized stony NEO with a period of 352 seconds, as well as (335433) 2005 UW163 and (60716) 2000 GD65, two main-belt asteroids, with a diameter of 0.86 and 2.25 kilometers and a period of 1.29 and 1.95 hours, respectively (see full list).\\r\\n\\r\\nMinor planets with orbital inclinations greater than 90 (the greatest possible is 180) orbit in a retrograde direction. As of  September?2016[update], of the more than 700,000 minor planets known, there are only 95 known retrograde minor planets.[12] In comparison, there are over 1920 comets with retrograde orbits. This makes retrograde minor planets the rarest group of all. High-inclination asteroids are either Mars-crossers (possibly in the process of being ejected from the Solar System) or damocloids. Some of these are temporarily captured in retrograde resonance with the gas giants.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n^  the value given when the number of observations is multiplied by the observation arc; larger values are generally better than smaller values depending on residuals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above table lists only numbered asteroids that are also comets. Note there are several cases where a non-numbered minor planets turned out to be a comet, e.g. C/2001 OG108 (LONEOS), which was provisionally designated 2001 OG108.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn earlier times, before the modern numbering and naming rules were in effect, asteroids were sometimes given numbers and names before their orbits were precisely known. And in a few cases duplicate names were given to the same object (with modern use of computers to calculate and compare orbits with old recorded positions, this type of error no longer occurs). This led to a few cases where asteroids had to be renamed.[19]","input":"What is the biggest asteroid in the solar system?"},{"output":"19 miles","context":"Blue Springs is a city located in the U.S. state of Missouri and within Jackson County. Blue Springs is located 19 miles (31?km) east of downtown Kansas City, Missouri and is the eighth largest city in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. As of the 2010 United States Census[update][4] the population was 52,575, tying it for 10th largest city in the state of Missouri with St. Peters. In 2010, CNN/Money Magazine ranked Blue Springs 49th on its list of the 100 Best Places to Live in the United States.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlue Springs history is tied to the migration of settlers on their westward journey. Pioneers found the area to be an ideal stopover due to the abundance of cool, clean water from a spring of the Little Blue River - hence the name Blue Springs. The presence of water and a need for pioneer supplies led to the construction of a grist mill and permanent settlement at the current site of the Citys Burrus Old Mill Park, on Woods Chapel Road.\\r\\nThe Jackson County Court granted the incorporation of Blue Springs on September 7, 1880, making the City the fourth settlement in the county. An early settler, Franklin Smith, arrived in Blue Springs from Virginia in 1838 and became a leading figure in the communitys development. He established the first post office in 1845,[7] naming it after the well-known springs.\\r\\nThe settlement continued to grow near the springs until 1878, when the Chicago and Alton Railroad announced plans to build a station about one mile east of the original settlement. To take advantage of the commerce the railroad would bring, the town moved its center to the site of the new station and continued its development as a rural trading center.[8] The Chicago & Alton Hotel built in 1878, located on Main Street west of the railroad tracks is the oldest business in the City of Blue Springs.\\r\\nHistorical attractions near or in Blue Springs include: Missouri Town 1855, Fort Osage National Historic Landmark, Dillingham-Lewis House Museum, Chicago & Alton Hotel Museum, and the Lone Jack Civil War Museum.\\r\\nUntil 1965, the Blue Springs City Hall was located in a very small block building under the old water tower on the northwest corner of 11th and Walnut Streets. City Hall and the water tower were torn down not long after vacating the buildings. From 1965 to 1968, the second City Hall was a metal building located in the 200 block of 11th Street, across the street from the former Blue Springs Post Office. It also has since been torn down. In 1968 the current City Hall was built at 903 W. Main Street as the Blue Springs Municipal Building. The Blue Springs Municipal Building held the Blue Springs Police Department in the lower level and city hall functions on the main level until 1988, when the Police Department moved to a new police station at 1100 SW Smith Street. The Municipal Building was remodeled in 1989 and was renamed the Blue Springs City Hall.\\r\\nAfter the old water tower was torn down, a new water tower was built in nearly the same location. The new water tower was torn down in April 2014, to make way for an expansion of the police department building.[9]\\r\\nThe June 1911 issue of Technical World magazine published an article claiming that Blue Springs \\"boasts of possessing the world's champion marble players,\\" and published a picture of a competition.

Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack. The screenplay by James Ashmore Creelman and Ruth Rose was from an idea conceived by Cooper and Edgar Wallace. It stars Fay Wray, Bruce Cabot and Robert Armstrong, and opened in New York City on March 2, 1933, to rave reviews. It has been ranked by Rotten Tomatoes as the greatest horror film of all time[5] and the twentieth greatest film of all time.[6]\\r\\nThe film tells of a gigantic, prehistoric, island-dwelling ape called Kong who dies in an attempt to possess a beautiful young woman. King Kong is especially noted for its stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and a groundbreaking musical score by Max Steiner. In 1991, it was deemed \\"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. It has been remade twice, in 1976 and 2005, while a reboot, Kong: Skull Island, was released in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New York Harbor, filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), famous for making wildlife films in remote and exotic locations, charters Captain Englehorn's (Frank Reicher) ship Venture for his new project, but is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has reluctantly added to the script. Due to set sail that night, Denham searches the streets of New York for a suitable woman. He meets penniless Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) and convinces her to join him for what he proposes as the adventure of a lifetime. The Venture quickly gets underway and, during the voyage, the surly first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), gradually falls in love with Ann.\\r\\nAfter weeks of secrecy, Denham finally tells Englehorn and Driscoll that their destination is Skull Island, an uncharted land shown on a map in Denham's possession. Denham also cryptically alludes to some monstrous creature rumored to dwell on the island, a legendary entity known only as \\"Kong\\". When they find the island and anchor offshore, they see a native village, separated from the rest of the island by an enormous ancient stone wall. A landing party, including the filming crew and Ann, witnesses a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young maiden as the \\"bride of Kong\\". The intruders are spotted and the native chief (Noble Johnson) angrily stops the ceremony. When he sees the blonde Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the \\"golden woman\\". They rebuff him and return to the Venture.\\r\\nThat night, a band of natives kidnap Ann from the ship and lead her through a huge wooden gate in the wall. Tied to an altar, she is offered to Kong, who turns out to be an enormous gorilla-like ape. Kong carries her off into the jungle as the Venture crew, alerted to Ann's abduction, arrive. They open the gate and Denham, Driscoll and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing Ann. They soon discover that Kong is far from the only giant prehistoric creature on the island when they are charged by a Stegosaurus, which they manage to kill. After constructing a raft in order to cross a swamp, a Brontosaurus capsizes their supplies, killing several of the men. Fleeing through the jungle, they soon encounter Kong, who tries to stop them from crossing a ravine by shaking them off a fallen tree that bridges it. Only Driscoll and Denham, on opposite sides, survive.\\r\\nA Tyrannosaurus threatens Ann, but Kong kills it after a colossal battle by breaking its neck and jaw. Driscoll continues to shadow Kong and Ann while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair in a mountain cave, Ann is menaced by a snake-like Elasmosaurus, which Kong wrestles and kills. While Kong is distracted killing a Pteranodon that tried to fly away with Ann, Driscoll reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, they let go and fall unharmed into the water below. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and murderously rampages through the village. On shore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a gas bomb.\\r\\nShackled in chains of chrome steel, Kong is presented to a Broadway theatre audience as \\"Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World\\". Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, followed by an invited group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose as the audience flees in terror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her. Kong's hand smashes through the hotel room window, knocking Jack unconscious and seizing Ann. Kong rampages through the city. He wrecks a crowded elevated train and ultimately climbs the Empire State Building. At its top, he is met by four Observation Aircraft. Kong sets Ann down and battles the planes, managing to down one of them, but he finally succumbs to their gunfire and falls to his death. Ann and Jack are reunited. Denham arrives and pushes through a crowd surrounding Kong's body in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham tells him, \\"Oh, no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast.\\"\\r\\nBefore King Kong entered production, a long tradition of jungle films existed, and, whether drama or documentary, such films generally adhered to a narrative pattern that followed an explorer or scientist into the jungle to test a theory only to discover some monstrous aberration in the undergrowth (see Stark Mad). In such films, scientific knowledge could be turned topsy-turvy at any time, and it was this that provided the genre with its vitality, appeal, and endurance.[7]\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, few zoos had primate exhibits so there was popular demand to see them on film. At the turn of the 20th century, the Lumire Brothers sent film documentarians to places westerners had never seen, and Georges Mlis utilized trick photography in film fantasies that prefigured that in King Kong. Jungle films were launched in the United States in 1913 with Beasts in the Jungle, a film that mixed live actors with lions, a tiger, and other animals. The film's popularity spawned similar pictures, including a few about \\"ape men\\" and gorillas. In 1918, Elmo Lincoln starred in Tarzan of the Apes,[7] and, in 1925, The Lost World made movie history with special effects by Willis O'Brien and a crew that later would work on King Kong.[8] William S. Campbell specialized in monkey-themed films with Monkey Stuff and Jazz Monkey in 1919, with Prohibition Monkey following in 1920. King Kong producer Ernest B. Schoedsack had earlier monkey experience directing Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness in 1927 (also with Merian C. Cooper) and Rango in 1931, both of which prominently featured monkeys in authentic jungle settings. Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the hoax documentary Ingagi in 1930, advertising the film as \\"an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas.\\" Ingagi was an unabashed black exploitation film, immediately running afoul of the Hollywood code of ethics, as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas, and baby offspring that looked more ape than human.[9] The film was an immediate hit, and by some estimates it was one of the highest-grossing movies of the 1930s at over $4 million. Although Cooper never listed Ingagi among his influences for King Kong, it has long been held that RKO green-lit Kong because of the bottom-line example of Ingagi and the formula that \\"gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits\\".[10]\\r\\nMerian C. Cooper's fascination with gorillas began with his boyhood reading of Paul Du Chaillu's Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa (1861) and was furthered in 1929 by studying a tribe of baboons in Africa while filming The Four Feathers. After reading W. Douglas Burden's The Dragon Lizards of Komodo, he fashioned a scenario depicting African gorillas battling Komodo dragons intercut with artificial stand-ins for joint shots. He then narrowed the dramatis personae to one ferocious, lizard-battling gorilla (rather than a group) and included a lone woman on expedition to appease those critics who belabored him for neglecting romance in his films. A remote island would be the setting and the gorilla would be dealt a spectacular death in New York City.[11]\\r\\nCooper took his concept to Paramount Studios in the first years of the Great Depression but executives shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, David O. Selznick brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant, and, to sweeten the deal, promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing The Most Dangerous Game, a story about a big game hunter, and hired his friend and former film partner, Ernest B. Schoedsack, to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, Creation, a story about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of dinosaurs. The film employed special effects wizard Willis O'Brien.[12]\\r\\nWhen Cooper screened O'Brien's stop-motion Creation footage, he was unimpressed, but realized he could economically make his gorilla picture by scrapping the Komodo dragons and costly location shoots for O'Brien's animated dinosaurs and the studio's existing jungle set. It was at this time Cooper probably cast his gorilla as a giant named Kong, and planned to have him die at the Empire State Building. The RKO board was wary about the project, but gave its approval after Cooper organized a presentation with Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot, and O'Brien's model dinosaurs. In his executive capacity, Cooper ordered the Creation production shelved, and put its crew to work on Kong.[13]\\r\\nCooper assigned recently hired RKO screenwriter and best-selling British mystery/adventure writer Edgar Wallace the job of writing a screenplay and a novel based on his gorilla fantasy. Cooper understood the commercial appeal of Wallace's name and planned to publicize the film as being \\"based on the novel by Edgar Wallace\\". Wallace conferred with Cooper and O'Brien (who contributed, among other things, the \\"Ann's dress\\" scene) and began work on January 1, 1932. He completed a rough draft called The Beast on January 5, 1932. Cooper thought the draft needed considerable work but Wallace died on February 10, 1932, just after beginning revisions.[7][14] Despite not using any of the draft in the final production beyond the previously agreed upon plot outline, Cooper gave a screen credit to Wallace as he had promised it as a producer.\\r\\nCooper called in James Ashmore Creelman (who was working on the script of The Most Dangerous Game at the time) and the two men worked together on several drafts under the title The Eighth Wonder. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, notably his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The 'beauty and the beast' angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from Madison Square Garden to Yankee Stadium and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.[14]\\r\\nTime constraints forced Creelman to temporarily drop The Eighth Wonder and devote his time to the Game script. RKO staff writer Horace McCoy was called in to work with Cooper, and it was he who introduced the island natives, a giant wall, and the sacrificial maidens into the plot. Leon Gordon also contributed to the screenplay in a minimal capacity; both he and McCoy went uncredited in the completed film.[15] When Creelman returned to the script full-time, he hated McCoy's 'mythic elements', believing the script already had too many over-the-top concepts, but Cooper insisted on keeping them in. RKO head Selznick and his executives wanted Kong introduced earlier in the film (believing the audience would grow bored waiting for his appearance), but Cooper persuaded them that a suspenseful build-up would make Kong's entrance all the more exciting.[16]\\r\\nCooper felt Creelman's final draft was slow-paced, too full of flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition,[16] and written on a scale that would have been prohibitively expensive to film.[17] Writer Ruth Rose (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled Kong for production.[18] Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.[19]\\r\\nFay Wray played bit parts in Hollywood until cast as the lead in Erich von Stroheim's 1928 silent film, The Wedding March. She met Kong co-directors Cooper and Schoedsack when cast as Ethne Eustace in The Four Feathers in 1929. Cooper cast her in 1932 as Eve Trowbridge in The Most Dangerous Game.[20]\\r\\nAfter the RKO board approved the Kong test, Cooper decided a blonde would provide contrast to the gorilla's dark pelt. Dorothy Jordan, Jean Harlow, and Ginger Rogers were considered, but the role finally went to Wray who wore a blonde wig in the film and was inspired more by Cooper's enthusiasm than the script to accept the role. According to her autobiography, On the Other Hand, Wray recounts that Cooper had told her he planned to star her opposite the \\"tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood\\". She assumed he meant Clark Gable until he showed her a picture of Kong climbing the Empire State Building.[20]\\r\\nOn the film's 50th anniversary in 1983, one New York theater held a Fay Wray scream-alike contest in its lobby,[15] and, two days after her death on August 8, 2004, the lights of the Empire State Building were dimmed for 15 minutes in her memory.[21]\\r\\nMichigan native and veteran Broadway and silent film character actor Robert Armstrong played Wray's alcoholic brother in The Most Dangerous Game and, during filming, became a member of the Cooper-Schoedsack inner circle. He was a shoo-in as Denham when Kong was cast.[20] The film's romantic angle (rather than its jungle or animal angle) was played-up after animal films fared poorly at the box office in the early months of 1933. One exhibitor displayed a promotional still of Wray swooning in Armstrong's arms with the caption, \\"Their Hearts Stood Still...For There Stood Kong! A Love Story of Today That Spans the Ages!\\". Although the film's romantic subplot belongs to Cabot and Wray, established star Armstrong was chosen for the ad rather than the unknown Cabot.[22] Months later, Armstrong again played Carl Denham in Kong's sequel, Son of Kong (1933).[23]\\r\\nNew Mexico native Jacques De Bujac was signed by Selznick as a contract player, given the name Bruce Cabot, and met Cooper when auditioning for The Most Dangerous Game. He almost walked out of his Kong audition (mistakenly believing he was trying out as a stunt double for Joel McCrea) but was convinced otherwise and received the role of Jack Driscoll, his first starring role.[24] He was an inexperienced actor and described his participation in Kong as standing in the right place, doing what he was told, and collecting a paycheck.[25]\\r\\nGerman-born Broadway veteran and silent film director Frank Reicher was cast as Captain Englehorn of the SS Venture, Victor Wong as the ship's cook Charlie, James Flavin as Second Mate Briggs, and a host of stuntmen and bit players as the ship's crew. Noble Johnson and Steve Clemente were members of the Cooper-Schoedsack inner circle and cast as the Native Chief and the Witch Doctor respectively while Etta McDaniel played a native mother of a child she rescues from Kong's rampage. Sam Hardy was cast as a theatrical agent and Sandra Shaw (later Mrs. Gary Cooper) was cast as the New York woman Kong drops to the street from the hotel ledge.[26] Merian C. Cooper, who was shot down in World War I in an Airco DH.4 and made a prisoner of war by the Germans, and who later flew with the Kosciuszko Squadron, played the airplane pilot and Schoedsack the machine gunner in uncredited roles in the film's final scenes.[27]\\r\\nAfter the RKO board approved the production of a test reel, Marcel Delgado constructed Kong (or the \\"Giant Terror Gorilla\\" as he was then known) per designs and directions from Cooper and O'Brien on a one-inch-equals-one-foot scale to simulate a gorilla 18 feet tall.[citation needed] Four models were built: two jointed 18-inch aluminum, foam rubber, latex, and rabbit fur models (to be rotated during filming), one jointed 24-inch model of the same materials for the New York scenes, and a small model of lead and fur for the plummeting-down-the-Empire-State-Building scene.[citation needed] At least two armatures have survived - one believed to be the original made for the test footage - and are owned by Peter Jackson and Bob Burns.[28] In 2009, one sold for S121,000 ($200,000) at Christie's in London.[29]\\r\\nKong's torso was streamlined to eliminate the comical appearance of the real world gorilla's prominent belly and buttocks. His lips, eyebrows, and nose were fashioned of rubber, his eyes of glass, and his facial expressions controlled by thin, bendable wires threaded through holes drilled in his aluminum skull. During filming, Kong's rubber skin dried out quickly under studio lights, making it necessary to replace it often and completely rebuild his facial features.[30]\\r\\nA huge bust of Kong's head, neck, and upper chest was made of wood, cloth, rubber, and bearskin by Delgado, E. B. Gibson, and Fred Reefe.[citation needed] Inside the structure, metal levers, hinges, and an air compressor were operated by three men to control the mouth and facial expressions. Its fangs were 10 inches in length and its eyeballs 12 inches in diameter. The bust was moved from set to set on a flatcar. Its scale matched none of the models and, if fully realized, Kong would have stood thirty to forty feet tall.[31]\\r\\nTwo versions of Kong's right hand and arm were constructed of steel, sponge rubber, rubber, and bearskin.[citation needed] The first hand was non articulated, mounted on a crane, and operated by grips for the scene in which Kong grabs at Driscoll in the cave. The other hand and arm had articulated fingers, was mounted on a lever to elevate it, and was used in the several scenes in which Kong grasps Ann. A non articulated leg was created of materials similar to the hands, mounted on a crane, and used to stomp on Kong's victims.[32]\\r\\nThe dinosaurs were made by Delgado in the same fashion as Kong and based on Charles R. Knight's murals in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. All the armatures were manufactured in the RKO machine shop. Materials used were cotton, foam rubber, latex sheeting, and liquid latex. Football bladders were placed inside some models to simulate breathing.[citation needed] A scale of one-inch-equals-one-foot was employed and models ranged from 18 inches to 3 feet in length. Several of the models were originally built for Creation and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked havoc with the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups. He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the Venture, railway cars, and war planes were built.[34]\\r\\nKing Kong is well known for its groundbreaking use of special effects, such as stop-motion animation, matte painting, rear projection and miniatures, all of which were conceived decades before the digital age.\\r\\nThe numerous prehistoric creatures inhabiting Skull Island were brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation by Willis OBrien and his assistant animator, Buzz Gibson. The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop, because it would make the movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence. A device called the surface gauge was used in order to keep track of the stop-motion animation performance. The iconic fight between Kong and the Tyrannosaurus took seven weeks to be completed. OBriens proteg, Ray Harryhausen, who would work with him on several films and become one of the most prominent stop-motion animators in Hollywood, stated that OBriens second wife noticed that there was so much of her husband in Kong.\\r\\nThe backdrop of Skull Island seen when the Venture crew first arrive was painted on glass by matte painters Henry Hillinck, Mario Larrinaga and Byron C. Crabb. The scene was then composted with separate bird elements and rear projected behind the ship and the actors. The background of the scenes in the jungle (a miniature set) were also painted on several layers of glass to convey the illusion of deep and dense jungle foliage.\\r\\nThe most difficult task for the special effects artists to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation - to make the interaction between the humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, than running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte. The Dunning process, invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lighting, filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera. It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.\\r\\nOn the other hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer Frank D. Williams, did not require a system of colored lights and could be used for wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use bipacking, but rather an optical printer, the first such device that synchronized a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composted image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot. The optical printer would continue to be used for films until the late 1980s, when they were superseded by digital composting.\\r\\nAnother technique that was used in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen. The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and Fred Jackman, who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the Tyrannosaurus fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a Stegosaurus.\\r\\nOBrien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear-projection in miniature sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected. A fan pumped cool air to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. The scene where Kong puts Ann in the top of a tree switched from a puppet in Kong's hand to a projected footage of Ann sitting.\\r\\nThe scene where Kong fights the snake-like reptile in his lair was likely the most significant special effects achievement of the film, due to the way in which all of the elements in the sequence work together at the same time. The scene was accomplished through the use of a miniature set, stop-motion animation for Kong, background matte paintings, real water, foreground rocks with bubbling mud, smoke and two miniature rear screen projections of Driscoll and Ann.\\r\\nOver the years, some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a gorilla suit.[35][36] However, film historians are generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models.[37][38]\\r\\nKing Kong was filmed in several stages over an eight-month period. Some actors had so much time between their Kong periods that they were able to fully complete work on other films. Cabot completed Road House and Wray appeared in the horror films Dr. X and Mystery of the Wax Museum. She estimated she worked for ten weeks on Kong over its eight-month production.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn May and June 1932, Cooper directed the first live-action Kong scenes on the jungle set built for The Most Dangerous Game. Some of these scenes were incorporated into the test reel later exhibited for the RKO board. The script was still in revision when the jungle scenes were shot and much of the dialogue was improvised. The jungle set was scheduled to be struck after Game was completed, so Cooper filmed all of the other jungle scenes at this time. The last scene shot was that of Driscoll and Ann racing through the jungle to safety following their escape from Kong's lair.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn July 1932, the native village was readied while Schoedsack and his crew filmed establishing shots in the harbor of New York City. Curtiss F8C-5/O2C-1 Helldiver war planes taking off and in flight were filmed at a U.S. Naval airfield on Long Island. Views of New York City were filmed from the Empire State Building for backgrounds in the final scenes and architectural plans for the mooring mast were secured from the building's owners for a mock-up to be constructed on the Hollywood sound stage.[39]\\r\\nIn August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at San Pedro, California. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the RKO-Path lot in Culver City with the native huts recycled from Bird of Paradise (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from DeMille's The King of Kings (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for Gone With the Wind's burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the scene depicting a New York woman being dropped to her apparent death from a hotel window was filmed on the sound stage using the articulated hand. At the same time, a scene depicting poker players surprised by Kong's face peering through a window was filmed using the 'big head', although the scene was eventually dropped.[40] When filming was completed, a break was scheduled to finish construction of the interior sets and to allow screenwriter Ruth Rose time to finish the script.\\r\\nIn SeptemberÿOctober 1932, Schoedsack returned to the sound stage after completing the native village shoots in Culver City. The decks and cabins of the Venture were constructed and all the live-action shipboard scenes were then filmed. The New York scenes were filmed, including the scene of Ann being plucked from the streets by Denham, and the diner scene. Following completion of the interior scenes, Schoedsack returned to San Pedro and spent a day on a tramp steamer to film the scene of Driscoll punching Ann, and various atmospheric harbor scenes. The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles was rented for one day to film the scenes where Kong is displayed in chains and the backstage theater scenes following his escape.[41] Principal photography wrapped at the end of October 1932 with the filming of the climax wherein Driscoll rescues Ann at the top of the Empire State Building. Schoedsack's work was completed and he headed to Syria to film outdoor scenes for Arabia, a project that was never completed.[42]\\r\\nIn December 1932 ÿ January 1933, the actors were called back to film a number of optical effects shots which were mostly rear-screen projections.[citation needed] Technical problems inherent in the process made filming difficult and time-consuming. Wray spent most of a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree to witness the battle between Kong and a Tyrannosaurus. She was sore for days after. Many of the scenes featuring Wray in the articulated hand were filmed at this time.[citation needed] In December, Cooper re shot the scene of the female New Yorker falling to her death. Stunt doubles were filmed for the water scenes depicting Driscoll and Ann escaping from Kong. A portion of the jungle set was reconstructed to film Denham snagging his sleeve on a branch during the pursuit scene. Originally, Denham ducked behind a bush to escape danger, but this was later considered cowardly and the scene was re shot. The final scene was originally staged on the top of the Empire State Building, but Cooper was dissatisfied and re shot the scene with Kong lying dead in the street with the crowd gathered about him.[citation needed]\\r\\nKing Kong was settled upon as the title, and the film cut from 125 to 100 minutes, with scenes that slowed the pace or diverted attention from Kong deleted. Infamously, the deleted scene was what later became known as the \\"Spider Pit Sequence\\", where a number of sailors from the Venture survived a fall into a ravine, only to be eaten alive by various large spiders, insects and other creatures. In a studio memo, Merian C. Cooper said that he cut the scene out himself because it \\"stopped the story\\". Aside from some still photographs and pre-production artwork, no trace of it has ever been found. Decades later, Peter Jackson would incorporate a re-imagining of this sequence for his 2005 King Kong remake, and he also shot another version of the scene for fun using stop-motion animation, which was included among the bonus features of the two-disc DVD of the 1933 original.[43]\\r\\nMurray Spivack provided the sound effects for the film. Kong's roar was created by mixing the recorded roars of zoo lions and tigers, subsequently played backwards slowly. Spivak himself provided Kong's \\"love grunts\\" by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed. For the huge ape's footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with plungers wrapped in foam attached to his own feet, while the sounds of his chest beats were recorded by Spivak hitting his assistant (who had a microphone held to his back) on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an air compressor for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with puma screams. Bird squawks were used for the Pteranodon. Spivak also provided the numerous screams of the various sailors. Fay Wray herself provided all of her character's screams in a single recording session.[44][45]\\r\\nFor budget reasons, RKO decided not to have an original film score composed, instead instructing composer Max Steiner to simply reuse music from other films. Cooper thought the film deserved an original score and paid Steiner $50,000 to compose it. Steiner completed the score in six weeks and recorded it with a 46-piece orchestra. The studio later reimbursed Cooper.[46] The score was unlike any that came before and marked a significant change in the history of film music. King Kong's score was the first feature-length musical score written for an American \\"talkie\\" film, the first major Hollywood film to have a thematic score rather than background music, the first to mark the use of a 46-piece orchestra, and the first to be recorded on three separate tracks (sound effects, dialogue, and music). Steiner used a number of new film scoring techniques, such as drawing upon opera conventions for his use of leitmotifs.[47]\\r\\nKing Kong opened at the 6,200-seat Radio City Music Hall in New York City and the 3,700-seat RKO Roxy across the street on Thursday, March 2, 1933. The film was preceded by a stage show called Jungle Rhythms. Crowds lined up around the block on opening day, tickets were priced at $.35 to $.75, and, in its first four days, every one of its ten-shows-a-day were sold out?ÿ setting an all-time attendance record for an indoor event. Over the four-day period, the film grossed $89,931.[48]\\r\\nThe film had its official world premiere on March 23, 1933 at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. The 'big head bust' was placed in the theater's forecourt and a seventeen-act show preceded the film with The Dance of the Sacred Ape performed by a troupe of African American dancers the highpoint. Kong cast and crew attended and Wray thought her on-screen screams distracting and excessive. The film opened nationwide on April 10, 1933, and worldwide on Easter Day in London, England.[48]\\r\\nVariety thought the film was a powerful adventure.[49] The New York Times gave readers an enthusiastic account of the plot and thought the film a fascinating adventure.[50] John Mosher of The New Yorker called it \\"ridiculous\\", but wrote that there were \\"many scenes in this picture that are certainly diverting\\".[51] The New York World-Telegram said it was \\"one of the very best of all the screen thrillers, done with all the cinema's slickest camera tricks\\".[52] The Chicago Tribune called it \\"one of the most original, thrilling and mammoth novelties to emerge from a movie studio.\\"[53]\\r\\nOn February 3, 2002, Roger Ebert included King Kong in his \\"Great Movies\\" list, writing that \\"In modern times the movie has aged, as critic James Berardinelli observes, and 'advances in technology and acting have dated aspects of the production.' Yes, but in the very artificiality of some of the special effects, there is a creepiness that isn't there in today's slick, flawless, computer-aided images.... Even allowing for its slow start, wooden acting and wall-to-wall screaming, there is something ageless and primeval about \\"King Kong\\" that still somehow works.\\"[54] King Kong holds an average score of 98% based on 54 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.[55]\\r\\nIn the 19th and early twentieth century, people of African descent were commonly visually represented as ape-like, a metaphor that fitted racist stereotypes, further bolstered by the emergence of scientific racism. Early blockbuster films frequently mirrored racial tensions. While King Kong is often compared to the story of Beauty and the Beast, many film scholars have argued that the film was a racist cautionary tale about interracial romance, in which the film's \\"carrier of blackness is not a human being, but an ape\\".[56] Cooper and Schoedsack rejected any allegorical interpretations, insisting in interviews that the film's story contained no hidden meanings.[57]\\r\\nThe film was a box office success making about $2 million in rentals on its initial release, with an opening weekend estimated at $90,000. Receipts fell by up to 50% in the second week of the film's release because of the national \\"bank holiday\\" called in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first days in office;[58] the film still did nicely. During the film's first run it made a profit of $650,000.[3] It was re-released in 1938, 1942, 1946, 1952 and 1956. After the 1952 re-release, Variety estimated the film had made $4 million in cumulative domestic rentals for that year.[59]\\r\\nKong did not receive any Academy Awards nominations. Selznick wanted to nominate O'Brien and his crew for a special award in visual effects but the Academy declined. Such a category did not exist at the time and would not exist until 1938. Sidney Saunders and Fred Jackman received a special achievement award for the development of the translucent acetate/cellulose rear screen?ÿ the only Kong-related award.[60]\\r\\nThe film has since received some significant honors. In 1975, Kong was named one of the 50 best American films by the American Film Institute, and, in 1991, the film was deemed \\"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 1998, the AFI ranked the film #43 on its list of the 100 greatest movies of all time.[61]\\r\\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\\r\\nKing Kong was re-released in 1938, 1942, 1946, 1952 and 1956, to great box office success. Stricter decency rules had been put into effect in Hollywood since its 1933 premiere and each time it was censored further, with several scenes, being either trimmed or excised altogether.\\r\\nThese scenes were as follows:[62]\\r\\nAfter the 1956 re-release, the film was sold to television (first being broadcast March 5, 1956).[63]\\r\\nRKO had failed to preserve copies of film's negative or release prints with the excised footage, and the cut scenes were considered lost for years. In 1969, a 16mm print, including the censored footage, was found in Philadelphia. The cut scenes were added to the film, restoring it to its original theatrical running time of 100 minutes. This version was re-released to art houses by Janus Films in 1970.[62]\\r\\nOver the next two decades, Universal Studios carried out further photochemical restoration on King Kong. This was based on a 1942 release print, with missing censor cuts taken from a 1937 print, which \\"contained heavy vertical scratches from projection.\\"[64] An original release print located in the UK in the 1980s was found to contain the cut scenes in better quality.\\r\\nAfter a 6-year worldwide search for the best surviving materials, a further, fully digital, restoration utilizing 4K resolution scanning was completed by Warner Bros. in 2005.[65] This restoration also had a 4-minute overture added, bringing the overall running time to 104 minutes. King Kong was also, somewhat controversially, colorized in the late 1980s for television.[66]\\r\\nIn 1984, King Kong was one of the first films to be released on LaserDisc by the Criterion Collection, and was the very first movie to have an audio commentary track included. Criterion's audio commentary was by film historian Ron Haver; in 1985 Image Entertainment released another LaserDisc, this time with a commentary by film historian and soundtrack producer Paul Mandell. Neither of these commentaries has since resurfaced on any other format.\\r\\nKing Kong had numerous VHS and LaserDisc releases of varying quality prior to receiving an official studio release on DVD. Those included a Turner 60th anniversary edition in 1993 featuring a front cover which had the sound effect of Kong roaring when his chest was pressed. It also included the colorized version of the film and a 25-minute documentary, It Was Beauty Killed the Beast (1992). The documentary is also available on two different UK King Kong DVDs, while the colorized version is available on DVD in the UK and Italy.[67] Warner Home Video re-released the black and white version on VHS with the 25-minute documentary included under the Warner Bros. Classics label in 1999.\\r\\nIn 2005 Warner Bros. released their digital restoration of King Kong in a US 2-disc Special Edition DVD, coinciding with the theatrical release of Peter Jackson's remake. It had numerous extra features, including a new, third audio commentary by visual effects artists Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston, with archival excerpts from actress Fay Wray and producer/director Merian C. Cooper. Warners issued identical DVDs in 2006 in Australia and New Zealand, followed by a US digibook-packaged Blu-ray in 2010.[68] In 2014 the Blu-ray was repackaged with three unrelated films in a 4 Film Favorites: Colossal Monster Collection.\\r\\nAt present, Universal holds worldwide rights to Kong's home video releases outside of the US, Australia and New Zealand. All Universal's releases only contain their earlier, 100 minute, pre-2005 restoration.[65]\\r\\nThe 1933 King Kong film and character inspired imitations and installments. Son of Kong, a direct sequel to the 1933 film was released nine months after the first film's release. In the early 1960s, RKO had licensed the King Kong character to Japanese studio Toho and produced two King Kong films, King Kong vs. Godzilla and King Kong Escapes, both directed by Ishir Honda.\\r\\nIn 1976, Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis released his version of King Kong, a modern remake of the 1933 film, which was followed by a sequel in 1986 titled King Kong Lives. In 2005, Universal Pictures released another remake of King Kong, directed by Peter Jackson. Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. released a Kong reboot film titled Kong: Skull Island in 2017 which was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts.\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nBibliography","input":"What kind of fur was used in the 1933 film king kong?"},{"output":"2008 model year","context":"The Nissan Rogue is a compact crossover SUV produced by the Japanese automaker Nissan. It made its debut in October 2007 for the 2008 model year.[1] The current model, the second generation launched in 2013, is the North American version of the Nissan X-Trail. It is currently Nissan's best-selling vehicle in the United States.[2][3]\\r\\nThe Rogue is powered by a 170?hp (127?kW; 172?PS), 2.5?L four-cylinder QR25DE engine mated to a standard continuously variable transmission,[4] and comes standard with front-wheel-drive. The Rogue costs less than Nissan's Murano crossover SUV, but at 105.8?cu?ft (3.00?m3) vs. 108.1?cu?ft (3.06?m3)[5] offers only slightly less passenger volume than its V6-powered sibling, and a nearly equal cargo area of 39.3?cu?ft (1,110?L) vs. 39.6?cu?ft (1,120?L).\\r\\nThe first generation Rogue remained in production for the 2013ÿ2015 model years as the Rogue Select.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Rogue is manufactured at the Nissan Smyrna assembly plant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nissan Rogue made its debut at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on January 7, 2007.

Since the production capacity allowed for the first generation to be built in conjunction with the 2nd generation, it allowed for a lower entry price to Rogue customers as well as fleet sales. It went on sale in January 2014 as a 2014 model year vehicle and was continued through 2015.

Since its adoption, the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non-symmetrical modifications to their vehicles, the Rogue being one of them. Another Small Overlap Test was conducted on a number of vehicles including a 2014 Rogue, but was conducted on the passenger side instead. Based on this test, the Rogue would have received a \\"Marginal\\" rating if the IIHS were to provide ratings for passenger-side protection. The crash test's intrusion was 10 inches further into the vehicle on the passenger's side than on the driver's side and completely tore off the structural door hinge pillar on the passenger side.[34]\\r\\nThe Rogue was redesigned for the 2014 model year. The redesigned Rogue shares no ratings with the previous design, built since the 2008 model year and given a new name for 2014-15, the Rogue Select. Starting with the 2014 year, the Rogue was awarded Top Safety Pick+ by IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety).[35]\\r\\nNissan vehicles built 2014 to 2017 were put under a recall as the occupant classification sensor (OCS) would think that an adult in the passenger seat is a child. They recalled over 6 million vehicles for either reprogramming or replacing.\\r\\nThe Rogue was facelifted for MY 2017, with restyled headlights and taillights, and LED daytime running lights standard on all trim levels.\\r\\nA hybrid Rogue debuted January 2017, with limited availability for the 2017 model year. The hybrid features regenerative braking, pure drive hybrid emblems, energy monitor, hybrid battery status, under-floor storage area replacing Divide-N-Hide@ Cargo System, a 2.0 Liter 4 cylinder gasoline engine (power: 141?hp and torque: 141?lb-ft) and Xtronic CVT combined with an electric motor (power: 40?hp) and Lithium-Ion battery, for a combined power of 176?hp. The Lithium-Ion battery is located below the thick flooring of the under-floor cargo storage area. The Rogue Hybrid will be available in 2 trim levels SV and SL, but the Rogue Hybrid will not be available with Third Row Seating (Family Package) and Divide-N-Hide@ Cargo System due to the Lithium-Ion battery.[36]\\r\\nIn 2007 the Rogue was featured on the television series Heroes, and in 2014, Nissan became the exclusive automotive partner for the launch of Apple's iTunes Radio, with the campaign theme \\"Make the Ordinary Extraordinary.\\"[37]\\r\\nA special edition model known as the \\"2017 Nissan Rogue: Rogue One Star Wars Limited Edition\\" inspired by the 2016 film Rogue One was released for the 2017 model year.

The Spuds MacKenzie mascot and campaign were created by a 23-year-old art director, Jon Moore. At the time he was working at Needham, Harper & Steers, a Chicago, Illinois, advertising agency. The dog first showed up in a Bud Light Super Bowl XXI ad in 1987.[1] During the height of his popularity, large amounts of Spuds merchandise was available, such as plush toys and t-shirts where the dog was seen surfing a wave or Hanging Twenty.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dog, a Bull Terrier, was not without its share of controversy. Shortly after Spuds' rise to fame it was learned that the dog, who was portrayed as male in the commercials, was actually female.[3]  The ads were also the subject of attacks and calls for censorship by temperance-oriented groups. Soon after the ads were first aired in 1987, Senator Strom Thurmond began his own media campaign, claiming that the beer maker was using Spuds to appeal to children for the purpose of getting them interested in their product at an early age.[4]  By Christmas 1987, more legal action resulted from Budweiser's use of ads featuring Spuds dressed as Santa, which is illegal in states such as Ohio.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, along with Mothers Against Drunk Driving, alleged that Anheuser-Busch was pitching the dog to children. Although the Federal Trade Commission found no evidence to support that allegation, Anheuser-Busch decided to retire Spuds in 1989, claiming that the character's image had started to overshadow the product.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character appeared in Bud Light's advertisement in Super Bowl LI as a ghost helping a man named Brian reunite with his friends in an homage to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.

Kerr Reservoir, also known as Bugg's Island Lake[1]) is a reservoir along the border of the U.S. states of North Carolina and Virginia. It is impounded by the John H. Kerr Dam, constructed between 1947 and 1952 to produce electricity and to provide flood control. Kerr Lake is owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers, and is the largest reservoir in Virginia. It is located in parts of Vance, Granville, and Warren counties in North Carolina, and Mecklenburg, Charlotte, and Halifax counties in Virginia. At its maximum capacity, it is one of the largest reservoirs in the Southeastern United States, covering approximately 50,000 acres (200?km2) and bordered by over 850 miles (1,370?km) of shoreline. The lake is named for Congressman John H. Kerr of North Carolina, who supported the original creation of the lake.\\r\\nThe lake is an impoundment of the Roanoke River (also called the Staunton River in Virginia). The Dan River and several smaller creeks also feed the lake. The lake is upstream of Lake Gaston. Just downstream from the John H. Kerr Dam, and visible from the viewing platform below the dam at Tailrace Park, lies Buggs Island, named for Samuel Bugg, an early settler. North Carolinians know this body of water as Kerr Lake, while Virginians know it as Buggs Island Lake or Buggs Island Reservoir.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe large lake is widely popular with both North Carolinians and Virginians for fishing and recreational purposes. For fishing, the lake has an abundance of large-mouth bass, striped bass (the only certified lake in Virginia to have a naturally reproducing population), crappie, catfish and bluegill. Camping is also a popular activity, with many campsites (run by the Army Corps of Engineers, North Carolina State Parks and Virginia State Parks) lining the shore including Kimball Point, North Bend Park, County Line, Hibernia, and others. Campsites for both tents and RVs are available. Jet-skiing and water-tubing occur often on the lake. Recreational motor boating and sailing also occur on the lake, with three privately operated marinas available: Steele Creek and Satterwhite Point in North Carolina, and Clarksville in Virginia. These marinas have rental slips for sail and motor boats, with additional amenities including fuel docks, marina stores, and some organized yacht clubs.

An extreme case is the Vedic Sanskrit of the Rigveda: the earliest parts of this text may date to c. 1500 BC,[1] while the oldest known manuscript dates to the 11th century AD, a gap of over 2,500 years. Similarly the oldest Avestan texts, the Gathas, are believed to have been composed before 1000 BC, but the oldest Avestan manuscripts date from the 13th century AD.[2]\\r\\nBecause of the way languages change gradually, it is usually impossible to pinpoint when a given language began to be spoken.

Strictly speaking, true nomads follow an irregular pattern of movement, in contrast with transhumance where seasonal pastures are fixed.[1] However this distinction is often not observed and the term nomad used for bothin historical cases the regularity of movements is often unknown in any case. The herded livestock include cattle, yaks, sheep, goats, reindeer, horses, donkeys or camels, or mixtures of species. Nomadic pastoralism is commonly practised in regions with little arable land, typically in the developing world, especially in the steppe lands north of the agricultural zone of Eurasia.[2] Of the estimated 30ÿ40 million nomadic pastoralists worldwide, most are found in central Asia and the Sahel region of West Africa. Increasing numbers of stock may lead to overgrazing of the area and desertification if lands are not allowed to fully recover between one grazing period and the next. Increased enclosure and fencing of land has reduced the amount of land available for this practice. There is substantive uncertainty over the extent to which the various causes for degradation affect grassland. Different causes have been identified which include overgrazing, mining, agricultural reclamation, pests and rodents, soil properties, tectonic activity, and climate change.[3] Simultaneously, it is maintained that some, such as overgrazing and overstocking, may be overstated while others, such as climate change, mining and agricultural reclamation, may be under reported. In this context, there is also uncertainty as to the long term effect of human behavior on the grassland as compared to non-biotic factors.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nomadic pastoralism was a result of the Neolithic revolution. During the revolution, humans began domesticating animals and plants for food and started forming cities. Nomadism generally has existed in symbiosis with such settled cultures trading animal products (meat, hides, wool, cheeses and other animal products) for manufactured items not produced by the nomadic herders. Henri Fleisch tentatively suggested the Shepherd Neolithic industry of Lebanon may date to the Epipaleolithic and that it may have been used by one of the first cultures of nomadic shepherds in the Beqaa valley.[5][6] Andrew Sherratt demonstrates that \\"early farming populations used livestock mainly for meat, and that other applications were explored as agriculturalists adapted to new conditions, especially in the semiarid zone.\\"[7]\\r\\nIn the past it was asserted that pastoral nomads left no presence archaeologically but this has now been challenged,[8] and was clearly not so for many ancient Eurasian nomads, who have left very rich kurgan burial sites. Pastoral nomadic sites are identified based on their location outside the zone of agriculture, the absence of grains or grain-processing equipment, limited and characteristic architecture, a predominance of sheep and goat bones, and by ethnographic analogy to modern pastoral nomadic peoples[9] Juris Zahrins has proposed that pastoral nomadism began as a cultural lifestyle in the wake of the 6200 BC climatic crisis when Harifian pottery making hunter-gatherers in the Sinai fused with Pre-Pottery Neolithic B agriculturalists to produce the Munhata[10] culture, a nomadic lifestyle based on animal domestication, developing into the Yarmoukian[11] and thence into a circum-Arabian nomadic pastoral complex, and spreading Proto-Semitic languages.[12]\\r\\nOften traditional nomadic groups settle into a regular seasonal pattern of transhumance. An example of a normal nomadic cycle in the northern hemisphere is:\\r\\nThe movements in this example are about 180 to 200?km. Camps are established in the same place each year; often semi-permanent shelters are built in at least one place on this migration route.\\r\\nIn sub-regions such as Chad, the nomadic pastoralist cycle is as follows:\\r\\nIn Chad, the sturdy villages are called hill, the less sturdy villages are called dankhout and the tents ferik.[14]\\r\\nDavid Christian (historian) made these observations.[15] The agriculturist lives from domesticated plants and the pastoralist lives from domesticated animals. Since animals are higher on the food chain, pastoralism supports a thinner population than agriculture. Pastoralism predominates where low rainfall makes farming impractical. Full pastoralism required the Secondary products revolution when animals began to be used for wool, milk, riding and traction as well as meat. Where grass is poor herds must be moved, which leads to nomadism. Some peoples are fully nomadic while others live in sheltered winter camps and lead their herds into the steppe in summer. Some nomads travel long distances, usually north in summer and south in winter. Near mountains, herds are led uphill in summer and downhill in winter (transhumance). Pastoralists often trade with or raid their agrarian neighbors.\\r\\nChristian distinguished Inner Eurasia which was pastoral with a few hunter-gatherers in the far north from Outer Eurasia ÿ a crescent of agrarian civilizations from Europe through India to China. High civilization is based on agriculture where tax-paying peasants support landed aristocrats, kings, cities, literacy and scholars. Pastoral societies are less developed and more egalitarian. One tribe would often dominate its neighbors, but these empires usually broke up after a hundred years or so. The heartland of pastoralism is the Eurasian steppe. In the center of Eurasia pastoralism extended south to Iran and surrounded agrarian oasis cities. When pastoral and agrarian societies went to war, horse-borne mobility counterbalanced greater numbers. Attempts by agrarian civilizations to conquer the steppe usually failed until the last few centuries. Pastoralists frequently raided and sometimes collected regular tribute from their farming neighbors. Especially in north China[16] and Iran, they would sometimes conquer agricultural societies, but these dynasties were usually short-lived and broke up when the nomads became civilized and lost their warlike virtues.\\r\\nNomadic pastoralism was historically widespread throughout less fertile regions of Earth. It is found in areas of low rainfall such as the Arabian Peninsula inhabited by Bedouins, as well as Northeast Africa inhabited by Somalis (where camel, sheep and goat nomadic pastoralism is especially common).[17] Nomadic transhumance is also common in areas of harsh climate, such as Northern Europe and Russia inhabited by the indigenous Sami people, Nenets people and Chukchis. There are an estimated 30-40 million nomads in the world.[18] Pastoral nomads and semi-nomadic pastoralists form a significant but declining minority in such countries as Saudi Arabia (probably less than 3%), Iran (4%), and Afghanistan (at most 10%). They comprise less than 2% of the population in the countries of North Africa except Libya and Mauritania.[19]\\r\\nThe Eurasian steppe has been largely populated by nomads since early prehistoric times, with a succession of peoples known by the names given to them by surrounding literate societies, including the Scythians, Saka and Yuezhi.\\r\\nThe Mongols in what is now Mongolia, Russia and China, and the Tatars or Turkic people of Eastern Europe and Central Asia were nomadic people who practiced nomadic transhumance on harsh Asian steppes. Some remnants of these populations are nomadic to this day. In Mongolia, about 40% of the population continues to live a traditional nomadic lifestyle.[20] In China, it is estimated that a little over five million herders are dispersed over the pastoral counties, and more than 11 million over the semi-pastoral counties. This brings the total of the (semi)nomadic herder population to over 16 million, in general living in remote, scattered and resource-poor communities.[21]\\r\\nIn the Middle Hills and Himalaya of Nepal, people living above about 2,000 m practise transhumance and nomadic pastoralism because settled agriculture becomes less productive due to steep slopes, cooler temperatures and limited irrigation possibilities. Distances between summer and winter pasture may be short, for example in the vicinity of Pokhara where a valley at about 800 meters elevation is less than 20?km. from alpine pastures just below the Annapurna Himalaya, or distances may be 100?km or more. For example, in Rapti zone some 100?km west of Pokhara the Kham Magar move their herds between winter pastures just north of India and summer pastures on the southern slopes of Dhaulagiri Himalaya. In far western Nepal, ethnic Tibetans living in Dolpo and other valleys north among the high Himalaya moved their herds north to winter on the plains of the upper Brahmaputra basin in Tibet proper, until this practice was prohibited after China took over Tibet in 1950-51.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe nomadic Sami people, an indigenous people of northern Finland, Sweden, Norway, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia, practise a form of nomadic transhumance based on reindeer. In the 14th and 15th century, when reindeer population was sufficiently reduced that Sami could not subsist on hunting alone, some Sami, organized along family lines, became reindeer herders. Each family has traditional territories on which they herd, arriving at roughly the same time each season. Only a small fraction of Sami have subsisted on reindeer herding over the past century; as the most colorful part of the population, they are well known. But as elsewhere in Europe, transhumance is dying out.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Mesta was an association of sheep owners, (Spanish nobility and religious orders) that had an important economic and political role in medieval Castile. To preserve the rights of way of its transhumant herds through ca?adas, the Mesta acted against small peasants.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Chad, nomadic pastoralists include the Zaghawa, Kreda, and Mimi. Farther north in Egypt and western Libya, the Bedouins also practice pastoralism.[citation needed]\\r\\nSometimes nomadic pastoralists move their herds across international borders in search of new grazing terrain or for trade. This cross-border activity can occasionally lead to tensions with national governments as this activity is often informal and beyond their control and regulation. In East Africa, for example, over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels and the unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure).[22] This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration.[22] However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, governments are unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.[22]\\r\\nThere have been initiatives seeking to promote cross-border trade and also document it, in order to both stimulate regional growth and food security, but also to allow the effective vaccination of livestock.[22] Initiatives include Regional Resilience Enhancement Against Drought (RREAD), the Enhanced Livelihoods in Mandera Triangle/Enhanced Livelihoods in Southern Ethiopia (ELMT/ELSE) as part of the Regional Enhanced Livelihoods in Pastoral Areas (RELPA) programme in East Africa, and the Regional Livelihoods Advocacy Project (REGLAP) funded by the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO).[22]","input":"Why do nomadic herders move their livestock from place to place?"},{"output":"multinational beverage corporation","context":"The Coca-Cola Company is an American multinational beverage corporation, and manufacturer, retailer, and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups.[2] The company is best known for its flagship product Coca-Cola, invented in 1886 by pharmacist John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia.[3] The Coca-Cola formula and brand were bought in 1889 by Asa Griggs Candler (December 30, 1851 ÿ March 12, 1929), who incorporated The Coca-Cola Company in 1892.

Of these, beverages bearing the trademark \\"Coca-Cola\\" or \\"Coke\\" accounted for approximately 78% of the company's total gallon sales.[21] According to the 2007 Annual Report, Coca-Cola had gallon sales distributed as follows: 43% in the United States, 37% in Mexico, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Japan, and the People's Republic of China, and 20% spread throughout the rest of the world.[citation needed] The figure in 2010 showed that they sold 1.6?billion drinks every day.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2010, it was announced that Coca-Cola had become the first brand to top S1?billion in annual UK grocery sales.[22] In 2017, Coke sales were down 11% from a year ago due to consumer tastes shifting away from sugary drinks and due to health risks associated with artificial sweeteners in Diet drinks.[23]\\r\\nSince the 1920s, Coca-Cola has been a publicly traded company.[24] One share of stock purchased in 1919 for $40, with all dividends reinvested, would be worth $9.8 million in 2012, a 10.7% annual increase, adjusted for inflation.[25] In 1987, Coca-Cola once again became one of the 30 stocks which makes up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is commonly referenced as a proxy for stock market performance; it had previously been a Dow stock from 1932 to 1935.[26] Coca-Cola has paid a dividend, increasing each year for 49 years.[27][28] Stock is available from a direct purchase program, through Computershare Trust Company, but unlike many programs, has investment fees.[29]\\r\\nThe following are key management as of May 2017 (excluding VP positions and regional leaders):[30]\\r\\nThe following are all directors as of November 2016:[30]\\r\\nIn general, The Coca-Cola Company and its subsidiaries only produce syrup concentrate, which is then sold to various bottlers throughout the world who hold a local Coca-Cola franchise. Coca-Cola bottlers, who hold territorially exclusive contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise the resulting Coca-Cola product to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants, and food service distributors. Outside the United States, these bottlers also control the fountain business.[citation needed]\\r\\nSince the early 1980s, the company has actively encouraged the consolidation of bottlers, with the company often owning a share of these \\"anchor bottlers\\".[31]\\r\\nThe company's largest bottlers outside North America are:[32]\\r\\nIn the United States, the company bypasses bottlers and is responsible for the manufacture and sale of fountain syrups directly to authorized fountain wholesalers and some fountain retailers.[34]\\r\\nAfter purchasing the North American assets of Coca-Cola Enterprises, as of 2014 the company directly owns 100% of Coca-Cola Refreshments, the anchor bottler of Coca-Cola products in North America, representing about 90% of Canada and 80% of the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther major bottlers in the United States are:\\r\\nIn September 2015, the company announced the sale of several production plants and territories to Swire, Consolidated, and United, and creation of the Coca-Cola National Product Supply System which controls 95% of the territory in the United States.[35]\\r\\nAfter Martin Luther King, Jr. won the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, plans for an interracial celebratory dinner in still-segregated Atlanta were not initially well supported by the city's business elite until Coca-Cola intervened.[36]\\r\\nJ. Paul Austin, the chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola, and Mayor Ivan Allen summoned key Atlanta business leaders to the Commerce Club's eighteenth floor dining room, where Austin told them flatly, 'It is embarrassing for Coca-Cola to be located in a city that refuses to honor its Nobel Prize winner. We are an international business. The Coca-Cola Company does not need Atlanta. You all need to decide whether Atlanta needs the Coca-Cola Company.' Within two hours of the end of that meeting, every ticket to the dinner was sold.\\r\\nOn April 4, 1968, former Coca-Cola president Robert W. Woodruff was meeting in the White House with President Lyndon B. Johnson when the news was brought to them of King's assassination in Memphis, Tennessee. Woodruff immediately arranged to have King's body flown to Atlanta aboard the company's corporate jet and to pay all funeral expenses. He also arranged to provide free Coca-Cola throughout Atlanta on the day of the funeral to help ensure calm.\\r\\nThroughout 2012, Coca-Cola contributed $1,700,500 to a $46?million political campaign known as \\"The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers\\".[38] This organization was set up to oppose a citizen's initiative, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients.[39]\\r\\nIn 2012, Coca-Cola was listed as a partner of the (RED) campaign, together with other brands such as Nike, Girl, American Express, and Converse. The campaign's mission is to prevent the transmission of the HIV virus from mother to child by 2015 (the campaign's byline is \\"Fighting for an AIDS Free Generation\\").[40]\\r\\nSince the early 2000s, the criticisms over the use of Coca-Cola products as well as the company itself, escalated with concerns over health effects, environmental issues, animal testing, economic business practices and employee issues. The Coca-Cola Company has been faced with multiple lawsuits concerning these various criticisms.\\r\\nCoca-Cola advertising has \\"been among the most prolific in marketing history\\", with a notable and major impact on popular culture and society as a whole.\\r\\nThe logo, bottle design, and brand image are internationally recognizable. Their product is ranked the number one soft drink, repeatedly, internationally, and has notoriety as the first soft drink consumed by astronauts in space. Coca-Cola employs a diverse range of integrated marketing communications to advertise through direct marketing, web based media, social media, and sales promotions (Stringer, 2015).[41]\\r\\nThe company carefully considers all touch points a consumer (or prospective consumer) has with the brand as potential delivery channels for the brand's message, and makes use of all relevant communication systems. This well established, long-standing, consistent approach has created a longing for the product that by far \\"superseded the desire for that typically associated with a drink to quench one's thirst\\" (Dudovskiy, 2015).[42]\\r\\nThey have exclusive vendor company partnerships, which eliminates competition, e.g. cinemas and restaurants only serving Coca-Cola over Pepsi. At sponsored sporting events, they again eliminate competition by attaining sole sale rights as well as VIP sales opportunities to important clients, for example, baseball fields.\\r\\nThe company also markets via mobile marketing in text messages, e.g. viral marketing campaigns (Stringer, 2015).[41]\\r\\nThey set the industry benchmark as the brand so universally recognized that audience building is unnecessary. Their fan engagement spans 86 million globally across social media channels. They deliver a consistently unified message whether it be through new products, online interaction, and social, cultural, or sporting events (Stringer, 2015).[41]\\r\\nIn the retail setting, direct store beverage delivery trucks (mobile advertising) as well as point of sale coolers and vending machines have bright red logo blazoned branding. In terms of food service, Coca-Cola is a food pairing suggestion that is now ingrained as a food match, e.g., for popcorn, burgers, fries, and hot dog combos (Stringer, 2015).[41]\\r\\nThe Coca-Cola Company offers more than 350 brands in over 200 countries, aside from its namesake Coca-Cola beverage.\\r\\nCoca-Cola bought Columbia Pictures in 1981 owing to the low monetary value of the studio. The film company was the first and only studio ever owned by Coca-Cola. During its ownership of the studio, the studio released many popular films including Ghostbusters, Stripes, The Karate Kid, and some others. However, after the 1987 film Ishtar, Columbia was sold to Tokyo-based Sony.\\r\\nCoca-Cola operates a soft drink themed tourist attraction in Atlanta, Georgia; the World of Coca-Cola is a multi-storied exhibition. It features flavor sampling and a history museum, with locations in Las Vegas, Nevada and Lake Buena Vista, Florida.[43][44]\\r\\nTab was Coca-Cola's first attempt to develop a diet soft drink, using saccharin as a sugar substitute. Introduced in 1963, the product is still sold today, although its sales have dwindled since the introduction of Diet Coke. The Tab soft drink is difficult to locate in recent times, due to its de facto replacement by Diet Coke.[45]\\r\\nThe Coca-Cola Company also produces a number of other soft drinks including Fanta (introduced circa 1941) and Sprite. Fanta's origins date back to World War II during a trade embargo against Germany on cola syrup, making it impossible to sell Coca-Cola in Germany. Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola's German office during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, made from products only available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta.[46] The drink proved to be a hit, and when Coke took over again after the war, it adopted the Fanta brand as well. Fanta was originally an orange flavored soft drink which can come in plastic bottles or cans. It has become available in many different flavors now such as grape, peach, grapefruit, apple, pineapple, and strawberry.\\r\\nIn 1961, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite, a lemon-lime soft drink, and another of the company's bestsellers and its response to 7 Up.\\r\\nCoca-Cola South Africa also released Valpre Bottled \\"still\\" and \\"sparkling\\" water.\\r\\nIn 1969, the company released Simba, which was a take on Mountain Dew, and had packaging that was African desert themed, replete with an African Lion as the symbol of the brand. The tagline was \\"Simba ÿ It Cures the African Thirst.\\"\\r\\nAlso in 1969, the company released a line of products under the name of Santiba, which was targeted for mixing cocktails and party usage, products including Quinine water and Ginger Ale. Like the above-mentioned Simba, the Santiba line of products was short lived in the marketplace.\\r\\nNo longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavour dispenser introduced by Coca-Cola and Siemens in 1988. Intended for use in offices with five to fifty people,[47] its refrigerated compartment held three individual one-litre plastic containers of soda syrup and a CO2 tank. Like a soda fountain, it mixed syrup in a 1:5 ratio with carbonated water. In North America, Coca-Cola discontinued spare BreakMate parts in 2007 and stopped distributing the syrup in 2010.[48]\\r\\nDuring the 1990s, the company responded to the growing consumer interest in healthy beverages by introducing several new non-carbonated beverage brands. These included Minute Maid Juices to Go, Powerade sports beverage, flavored tea Nestea (in a joint venture with Nestl), Fruitopia fruit drink, and Dasani water, among others. In 2001, Minute Maid division launched the Simply Orange brand of juices including orange juice. 2016, Coca-Cola India]] introduced Vio (flavoured milk) to enter into the value-added dairy category, the product lays the foundation for Coca-Cola's new segment after carbonated beverages: water and juices.[49]\\r\\nIn 2004, perhaps in response to the burgeoning popularity of low-carbohydrate diets such as the Atkins diet, Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed C2 Cola. C2 contains a mix of high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, sucralose, and Acesulfame potassium. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with less than half of the food energy and carbohydrates of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.\\r\\nStarting in 2009, The Coca-Cola Company invested in Innocent Drinks, first with a minor stake, increasing to 90% in the first quarter of 2013.[50]\\r\\nIt was in May 2014 when Finley, a sparkling fruit-flavoured drink, was launched in France. It was launched in other countries later,[51] including Belgium and Luxembourg in September. The drink had first been developed to start by Coca-Cola in 2001 in Belgium.[52] The drink is targeted for adults, and is low in sugar with four flavors in 2014.[51]\\r\\nCoca-Cola is the best-selling soft drink in most countries, and was recognized as the number one global brand in 2010.[53] While the Middle East is one of the only regions in the world where Coca-Cola is not the number one soda drink, Coca-Cola nonetheless holds almost 25% marketshare (to Pepsi's 75%) and had double-digit growth in 2003.[54] Similarly, in Scotland, where the locally produced Irn-Bru was once more popular, 2005 figures show that both Coca-Cola and Diet Coke now outsell Irn-Bru.[55] In Peru, the native Inca Kola has been more popular than Coca-Cola, which prompted Coca-Cola to enter in negotiations with the soft drink's company and buy 50% of its stakes. In Japan, the best selling soft drink is not cola, as (canned) tea and coffee are more popular.[56] As such, The Coca-Cola Company's best selling brand there is not Coca-Cola, but Georgia.[57] In May 2016, The Coca-Cola Company temporarily halted production of its signature drink in Venezuela due to sugar shortages.[58] Since then, The Coca-Cola Company has since been using \\"minimum inventories of raw material\\" to make their signature drinks at two production plants in Venezuela.[59]\\r\\nOn July 6, 2006, a Coca-Cola employee and two other people were arrested and charged with trying to sell trade secrets information to the soft drink maker's competitor, PepsiCo for $1.5?million. The recipe for Coca-Cola, perhaps the company's most closely guarded secret, was never in jeopardy. Instead, the information was related to a new beverage in development. Coca-Cola executives verified that the documents were valid and proprietary. At least one glass vial containing a sample of a new drink was offered for sale, court documents said. The conspiracy was revealed by PepsiCo, which notified the authorities when they were approached by the conspirators.[60]\\r\\nThe company announced a new \\"negative calorie\\" green tea drink, Enviga, in 2006, along with trying coffee retail concepts Far Coast and Chaqwa.\\r\\nOn May 25, 2007, Coca-Cola announced it would purchase Glaceau, a maker of flavored vitamin-enhanced drinks (vitamin water), flavored waters, and Burn energy drinks, for $4.1?billion in cash.[61]\\r\\nOn September 3, 2008, Coca-Cola announced its intention to make cash offers to purchase China Huiyuan Juice Group Limited (which has a 42% share of the Chinese pure fruit juice market[62]) for US$2.4bn (HK$12.20 per share).[63] China's ministry of commerce blocked the deal on March 18, 2009, arguing that the deal would hurt small local juice companies, could have pushed up juice market prices, and limited consumers' choices.[64]\\r\\nIn October 2009, Coca-Cola revealed its new 90-calorie mini can that holds 7.5 fluid ounces.[65] The mini can is often sold in 8 packs. Despite costing nearly 30 percent more per ounce, the mini cans have been met with positive sales figures.[66]\\r\\nIn November 2011, Coca-Cola revealed a seasonal design for their regular Coke cans as part of a partnership with the World Wildlife Fund. However it was withdrawn only a month after release due to consumer complaints about the similar look to the silver cans commonly used for Diet Coke. There were also complaints about deviating from traditional red as the color of Coca-Cola cans previously.[67]\\r\\nIt was announced on August 14, 2014, that Coca-Cola Co is making a cash payment of $2.15?billion for a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp to expand its market for energy drinks. Coke's ownership in Full Throttle and Burn will be transferred to Monster. In return, Monster will transfer its ownership in Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Iced Tea to Coke. Muhtar Kent, Coke's chief executive officer, stated that the company has the option to increase its stake to 25 percent but cannot exceed that percentage in the next four years.[68][69]\\r\\nCoca-Cola's advertising expenses accounted for US$3.256?billion in 2011.[70]\\r\\nCoca-Cola sponsored the English Football League from the beginning of the 2004ÿ05 season (beginning August 2004) to the start of 2010/11 season, when the Football League replaced it with NPower.[citation needed] Along with this, Coca-Cola sponsored the Coca-Cola Football Camp, that took place in Pretoria, South Africa during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, during which hundreds of teenagers from around the world were able to come together and share their love of the game, partly due to Best Buy's efforts through their @15 program.[71]\\r\\nOther major sponsorships include the AFL; NHRA; NASCAR; the PGA Tour; NCAA Championships; the Olympic Games; the NRL; the FIFA World Cups; and the UEFA European Championships.[citation needed] Each Fall, Coca-Cola is the sponsor of the TOUR Championship by Coca-Cola held at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta, GA. The TOUR Championship is the season ending tournament of the PGA TOUR.[citation needed] In the Philippines, it has a team in the Philippine Basketball Association, the Powerade Tigers.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe company sponsored the popular Fox singing-competition series American Idol from 2002 until 2014.[72]\\r\\nCoca-Cola is a sponsor of the nightly talk show on PBS, Charlie Rose in the US.[73]\\r\\nCoca-Cola are also executive producers of Coke Studio (Pakistan). There are various adaptations of Coke Studio such as Coke Studio (India) and Coke Studio (Middle East).\\r\\nWhile not necessarily having naming rights to anything in all locations, the company does sponsor and provide beverages in many theme parks, usually in an exclusive capacity. This includes the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts,[a] Merlin Entertainment, Universal Parks & Resorts, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, and SeaWorld Entertainment which are six of the nine largest theme park operators worldwide (it is unknown whether OCT Parks China, the Chimelong Group, or Fantawild, the fourth, seventh, and eighth largest theme park operators respectively, use Coca-Cola).[76]\\r\\nThe company also directly sponsors, with naming rights, the Coca-Cola London Eye and the Coca-Cola Orlando Eye.[77][78]\\r\\nThe company also operates \\"Coca-Cola\\" visitor centers in Israel, Belgium and Turkey.[79][80][81]","input":"What type of industry is the coca cola company?"},{"output":"flagship of the Earth Observing System","context":"Terra (EOS AM-1) is a multi-national NASA scientific research satellite in a Sun-synchronous orbit around the Earth.[1] It is the flagship of the Earth Observing System (EOS).

She was the last remaining survivor of the sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912.[1] At 3 months old, she was also the youngest passenger aboard.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDean was born in Branscombe, England, to Bertram Frank Dean (1886ÿ1912) and Georgette Eva Light (1879ÿ1975). She had an older brother, Bertram Vere Dean, born 21 May 1910. She never married and had no children.[3] Her father died on the Titanic; her mother died on 16 September 1975, aged 96; and her brother died on 14 April 1992, age 81, the 80th anniversary of the iceberg collision.\\r\\nDean's parents decided to leave the United Kingdom and emigrate to Wichita, Kansas, where her father had relatives, and his cousin owned a tobacco shop that he was going to co-own.[4] They were not supposed to be aboard the Titanic, but due to a coal strike, they were transferred onto it and boarded it as third-class passengers at Southampton, England. Dean was barely three months old when she boarded the ship. Her father felt its collision with the iceberg on the night of 14 April 1912, and after investigating, returned to his cabin, telling his wife to dress the children and go up on deck. Dean, her mother, and her brother were placed in Lifeboat 10 and were among the first third-class passengers to escape.[i] Her father, however, did not survive, and his body, if recovered, was never identified.\\r\\nAt first, Dean's mother wanted to continue on to Kansas to fulfil her husband's wish of a new life in the United States. However, after losing him and being left with two small children for whom to care, they returned to Britain aboard the RMS?Adriatic. While aboard the ship, Dean attracted considerable attention. An article in the Daily Mirror dated 12 May 1912 described the ordeal:\\r\\nMillvina and Bertram were raised mostly on pension funds and educated in Southampton schools, including The Gregg School. It was not until she was eight years old, and her mother was planning to remarry, that Dean was told she had been a passenger on the Titanic.\\r\\nDean worked for the British government during the Second World War and later as a purchaser for a local engineering firm. Other careers she held were as a cartographer, a secretary, and an assistant to a tobacconist.\\r\\nIt was not until Dean was in her seventies that she became involved in Titanic-related events. Over the years, she participated in numerous conventions, exhibitions, documentaries, radio and television interviews, and personal correspondence. In 1998, she travelled to the United States to participate in a Titanic convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, and another in 1999 in Montreal. She had also been scheduled to appear at a commemoration of the 94th anniversary of the sinking in 2006, but a broken hip prevented her appearance.[6] She also appeared in the History special Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn October 2007, Dean became the last Titanic survivor following the death of Barbara West Dainton, who died at age 96 in England.[7]\\r\\nIn December 2007, Dean criticised the BBC and its television programme Doctor Who for including an episode with a starship \\"cruise liner\\" called the Titanic, that was similar in appearance to the historical liner. Speaking from her nursing home, she said: \\"The Titanic was a tragedy which tore so many families apart. I lost my father and he lies on that wreck. I think it is disrespectful to make entertainment of such a tragedy.\\"[8] A spokeswoman for the show said: \\"No offence was intended. 'Voyage of the Damned' is set on a spaceship called The Titanic and not a boat.\\"[8]\\r\\nIn April 2008, Dean had accepted an invitation to speak in Southampton at an event commemorating the 96th anniversary of the sinking, but ill health resulting from a respiratory infection forced her to cancel.[9]\\r\\nIn December 2008, at age 96, Dean was forced to sell several of her family's possessions to pay for her private medical care following a broken hip. These included a letter sent to her mother from the Titanic Relief Fund, and a suitcase given to her and her mother in New York following the sinking. Their sale raised approximately S32,000. In February 2009, she announced that she would be selling several more items to pay for her increasing medical costs which she said exceeded S3,000 a month.[10]\\r\\n97-year-old Dean died of pneumonia on the morning of 31 May 2009, 97 years and seven weeks after the Titanic sailed, at a care home in Ashurst, Hampshire.[2][11] She was cremated, and on 24 October 2009, her ashes were scattered from a launch at the docks in Southampton where the Titanic set sail.[12]\\r\\nIn response to the escalating cost of Dean's healthcare, The Millvina Fund was set up in April 2009 by the Belfast, British, and International Titanic Societies with the exclusive aim of taking care of her nursing home bills. It was given a boost by the Irish author and campaigning journalist, Don Mullan, at the opening of his worldwide Nokia photographic exhibition, A Thousand Reasons for Living, (featuring a portrait of Dean) in Dublin on 22 April 2009.[13] Mullan introduced an additional portrait of Dean's hands, as she signed a card for a Titanic autograph collector, which he produced as a limited edition of 100 copies. He made the edition available at ?500 each and then challenged the director and stars of the film Titanic (1997) - James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet - singer Celine Dion, and the corporations Sony Music, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount Pictures to match him euro-for-euro to support her with her bills.[14][15] DiCaprio and Winslet led the way with a joint contribution of US$20,000. Cameron and Dion donated US$10,000 each.","input":"When did the last remaining survivor of the titanic die?"},{"output":"controls accommodation for viewing objects at varying distances and regulates the flow of aqueous humour into Schlemm's canal","context":"short ciliary\\r\\nFrom oculomotor nerve\\r\\nThrough ciliary ganglion\\r\\nThe ciliary muscle /?s?li.??ri/ is a ring of smooth muscle[2][3] in the eye's middle layer (vascular layer) that controls accommodation for viewing objects at varying distances and regulates the flow of aqueous humour into Schlemm's canal. It changes the shape of the lens within the eye, not the size of the pupil which is carried out by the sphincter pupillae muscle and dilator pupillae.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ciliary muscle develops from mesenchyme within the choroid and is considered a cranial neural crest derivative.[4]\\r\\nThe ciliary muscle receives parasympathetic fibers from the short ciliary nerves that arise from the ciliary ganglion. The sympathetic postganglionic fibers are part of cranial nerve V (Nasociliary nerve of the trigeminal).[5] The postganglionic sympathetic innervation arises from the superior cervical ganglia[6]\\r\\nPresynaptic parasympathetic signals that originate in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus are carried by cranial nerve III (the oculomotor nerve) and travel through the ciliary ganglion via the postganglionic parasympathetics fibers which travel in the short ciliary nerves and supply the ciliary body and iris. Parasympathetic activation of the M3 muscarinic receptors causes ciliary muscle contraction, the effect of contraction is to decrease the diameter of the ring of ciliary muscle (causing constriction of the pupil and accommodation). The zonule fibers relax and the lens becomes more spherical, increasing its power to refract light for near vision.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe parasympathetic tone is dominant when a higher degree of accommodation of the lens is required, such as reading a book.[7]\\r\\nThe ciliary fibers have circular (Ivanoff),[8] longitudinal (meridional) and radial orientations.[9]\\r\\nAccording to Hermann von Helmholtz's theory, the circular ciliary muscle fibers affect zonular fibers in the eye (fibers that suspend the lens in position during accommodation), enabling changes in lens shape for light focusing. When the ciliary muscle contracts, it pulls itself forward and moves the frontal region toward the axis of the eye. This releases the tension on the lens caused by the zonular fibers (fibers that hold or flatten the lens). This release of tension of the zonular fibers causes the lens to become more spherical, adapting to short range focus. Conversely, relaxation of the ciliary muscle causes the zonular fibers to become taut, flattening the lens, increasing the focal distance,[10] increasing long range focus. Although Helmholtz's theory has been widely accepted since 1855, its mechanism still remains controversial. Alternative theories of accommodation have been proposed by others, including L. Johnson, M. Tscherning, and especially Ronald A. Schachar.[2]\\r\\nContraction and relaxation of the longitudinal fibers, which insert into the trabecular meshwork in the anterior chamber of the eye, cause an increase and decrease in the meshwork pore size, respectively, facilitating and impeding aqueous humour flow into the canal of Schlemm.[11]\\r\\nOpen-angle glaucoma (OAG) and closed-angle glaucoma (CAG) may be treated by muscarinic receptor agonists (e.g., pilocarpine), which cause rapid miosis and contraction of the ciliary muscles, opening the trabecular meshwork, facilitating drainage of the aqueous humour into the canal of Schlemm and ultimately decreasing intraocular pressure.[12]\\r\\nThe word ciliary had its origins around 1685ÿ1695.[13] The term cilia originated a few years later in 1705ÿ1715, and is the Neo-Latin plural of cilium meaning eyelash. In Latin, cilia means upper eyelid and is perhaps a back formation from supercilium, meaning eyebrow. The suffix -ary originally occurred in loanwords from Middle English (-arie), Old French (-er, -eer, -ier, -aire, -er), and Latin (-rius); it can generally mean \\"pertaining to, connected with\\", \\"contributing to\\", and \\"for the purpose of\\".[14] Taken together, cili(a)-ary pertains to various anatomical structures in and around the eye, namely the ciliary body and annular suspension of the lens of the eye.[15]\\r\\nThe arteries of the choroid and iris.

The Fleet consisted of two Royal Navy vessels, three store ships and six convict transports, carrying between 1,000 and 1,500 convicts, marines, seamen, civil officers and free people (accounts differ on the numbers), and a vast quantity of stores. From England, the Fleet sailed southwest to Rio de Janeiro, then east to Cape Town and via the Great Southern Ocean to Botany Bay, arriving over the period of 18 to 20 January 1788, taking 250 to 252 days from departure to final arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvicts were originally transported to the Thirteen Colonies in North America, but after the American War of Independence ended in 1783, the newly formed United States refused to accept further convicts.[1] On 6 December 1785, Orders in Council were issued in London for the establishment of a penal colony in New South Wales, on land claimed for Britain by explorer James Cook in his first voyage to the Pacific in 1770.[2][3]\\r\\nThe First Fleet was commanded by Commodore Arthur Phillip, who was given instructions authorising him to make regulations and land grants in the colony.[4] The ships arrived at Botany Bay between 18 January and 20 January 1788:[5] HMS Supply arrived on 18 January, Alexander, Scarborough and Friendship arrived on 19 January, and the remaining ships on 20 January.[6][7]\\r\\nThe cost to Britain of outfitting and despatching the Fleet was S84,000[8] (about S9.6 million as of 2015).[9]\\r\\nThe First Fleet included two Royal Navy escort ships, the ten-gun sixth-rate vessel HMS?Sirius under the command of Captain John Hunter, and the armed tender HMS?Supply commanded by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball.\\r\\nRopes, crockery, agricultural equipment and a miscellany of other stores were needed. Items transported included tools, agricultural implements, seeds, spirits, medical supplies, bandages, surgical instruments, handcuffs, leg irons and a prefabricated wooden frame for the colony's first Government House.[12] The party had to rely on its own provisions to survive until it could make use of local materials, assuming suitable supplies existed, and grow its own food and raise livestock.\\r\\nScale models of all the ships are on display at the Museum of Sydney. The models were built by ship makers Lynne and Laurie Hadley, after researching the original plans, drawings and British archives. The replicas of the Supply, Charlotte, Scarborough, Friendship, Prince of Wales, Lady Penrhyn, Borrowdale, Alexander, Sirius?(1786), Fishburn and Golden Grove are made from Western Red or Syrian Cedar.[13]\\r\\nNine Sydney harbour ferries built in the mid-1980s are named after First Fleet vessels. The unused names are Lady Penrhyn and Prince of Wales.\\r\\nThe people of the fleet included seamen, marines and their families, government officials, and a large number of convicts, including women and children. The majority were British, but there were also African, American and French convicts on board.[14][15] The convicts had committed a variety of crimes, including theft, perjury, fraud, assault, and robbery, for which they had variously been sentenced to penal transportation for 7 years, 14 years, or the term of their natural life.[16][17]\\r\\nThe six convict transports each had a detachment of marines on board. Most of the families of the marines traveled aboard the Prince of Wales.[18] A number of people on the First Fleet kept diaries and journals of their experiences, including the surgeons. There are twelve known journals in existence as well as some letters.[19]\\r\\nThe exact number of people directly associated with the First Fleet will likely never be established, as accounts of the event vary slightly. A total of 1,420 people have been identified as embarking on the First Fleet in 1787, and 1,373 are believed to have landed at Sydney Cove in January 1788. In her biographical dictionary of the First Fleet, Mollie Gillen gives the following statistics:[20]\\r\\nWhile the names of all crew members of Sirius and Supply are known, the six transports and three storeships may have carried as many as 110 more seamen than have been identified ÿ no complete musters have survived for these ships. The total number of persons embarking on the First Fleet would, therefore, be approximately 1,530 with about 1,483 reaching Sydney Cove.\\r\\nOther sources indicate that the passengers consisted of 10 civil officers, 212 marines, including officers, 28 wives and 17 children of the marines, 81 free people, 504 male convicts and 192 female convicts; making the total number of free people 348 and the total number of prisoners 696, coming to a grand total of 1,044 people.\\r\\nAccording to the first census of 1788 as reported by Governor Phillip to Lord Sydney, the white population of the colony was 1,030 and the colony also consisted of 7 horses, 29 sheep, 74 swine, 6 rabbits, and 7 cattle.[21]\\r\\nThe following statistics were provided by Governor Phillip:[22]\\r\\nDavid Collins' book An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales gives the following details:[23]\\r\\nThe Alexander, of 453 tons, had on board 192 male convicts; 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 29 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThe Scarborough, of 418 tons, had on board 205 male convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 26 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThe Charlotte, of 346 tons, had on board 89 male and 20 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 3 corporals, 1 drummer, and 35 privates, with the principal surgeon of the colony.\\r\\nThe Lady Penrhyn, of 338 tons, had on board 101 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, and 3 privates, with a person acting as a surgeon's mate.\\r\\nThe Prince of Wales, of 334 tons, had on board 2 male and 50 female convicts; 2 lieutenants, 3 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 24 privates, with the surveyor-general of the colony.\\r\\nThe Friendship,  of 228 tons, had on board 76 male and 21 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 3 corporals, 1 drummer, and 36 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThere were on board, beside these, 28 women, 8 male and 6 female children, belonging to the soldiers of the detachment, together with 6 male and 7 female children belonging to the convicts.\\r\\nThe Fishburn store-ship was of 378 tons; the Borrowdale of 272 tons; and the Golden Grove of 331 tons. Golden Grove carried the chaplain for the colony, with his wife and a servant.\\r\\nNot only these store-ships, but the men of war and transports were laden with provisions, implements of agriculture, camp equipage, clothing for the convicts, baggage, etc.\\r\\nThe Sirius carried as supernumeraries, the major commandant of the corps of marines embarked in the transports* [*This officer was also lieutenant-governor of the colony], the adjutant and quarter-master, the judge-advocate of the settlement, and the commissary; with one sergeant, three drummers, seven privates, four women, and a few artificers.\\r\\nThe chief surgeon for the First Fleet, John White, reported a total of 48 deaths and 28 births during the voyage. The deaths during the voyage included one marine, one marine's wife, one marine's child, 36 male convicts, four female convicts, and five children of convicts.[24]\\r\\nThe First Fleet left Portsmouth, England on 13 May 1787.[25] The journey began with fine weather, and thus the convicts were allowed on deck.[26] The Fleet was accompanied by the armed frigate Hyena until it left English waters.[27] On 20 May 1787, one convict on the Scarborough reported a planned mutiny; those allegedly involved were flogged and two were transferred to Prince of Wales.[27] In general, however, most accounts of the voyage agree that the convicts were well behaved.[27] On 3 June 1787, the fleet anchored at Santa Cruz at Tenerife.[25] Here, fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. Phillip and the chief officers were entertained by the local governor, while one convict tried unsuccessfully to escape.[28] On 10 June they set sail to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro,[25] taking advantage of favourable trade winds and ocean currents.\\r\\nThe weather became increasingly hot and humid as the Fleet sailed through the tropics. Vermin, such as rats, and parasites such as bedbugs, lice, cockroaches and fleas, tormented the convicts, officers and marines. Bilges became foul and the smell, especially below the closed hatches, was over-powering.[29] While Phillip gave orders that the bilge-water was to be pumped out daily and the bilges cleaned, these orders were not followed on the Alexander and a number of convicts fell sick and died.[29] Tropical rainstorms meant that the convicts could not exercise on deck as they had no change of clothes and no method of drying wet clothing.[29] Consequently, they were kept below in the foul, cramped holds. On the female transports, promiscuity between the convicts, the crew and marines was rampant, despite punishments for some of the men involved.[29] In the doldrums, Phillip was forced to ration the water to three pints a day.[29]\\r\\nThe Fleet reached Rio de Janeiro on 5 August and stayed for a month.[25] The ships were cleaned and water taken on board, repairs were made, and Phillip ordered large quantities of food.[26] The women convicts' clothing had become infested with lice and was burnt. As additional clothing for the female convicts had not arrived before the Fleet left England,[26] the women were issued with new clothes made from rice sacks. While the convicts remained below deck, the officers explored the city and were entertained by its inhabitants.[30] A convict and a marine were punished for passing forged quarter-dollars made from old buckles and pewter spoons.\\r\\nThe Fleet left Rio de Janeiro on 4 September to run before the westerlies to the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa, which it reached on 13 October.[31] This was the last port of call, so the main task was to stock up on plants, seeds and livestock for their arrival in Australia.[32] The livestock taken on board from the Cape of Good Hope destined for the new colony included two bulls, seven cows, one stallion, three mares, 44 sheep, 32 pigs, four goats and \\"a very large quantity of poultry of every kind\\".[33] Women convicts on the Friendship were moved to other transports to make room for livestock purchased there. The convicts were provided with fresh beef and mutton, bread and vegetables, to build up their strength for the journey and maintain their health.[32] The Dutch colony of Cape Town was the last outpost of European settlement which the fleet members would see for years, perhaps for the rest of their lives. \\"Before them stretched the awesome, lonely void of the Indian and Southern Oceans, and beyond that lay nothing they could imagine.\\"[34]\\r\\nAssisted by the gales in the \\"Roaring Forties\\" latitudes below the 40th parallel, the heavily laden transports surged through the violent seas. In the last two months of the voyage, the Fleet faced challenging conditions, spending some days becalmed and on others covering significant distances; the Friendship travelled 166 miles one day, while a seaman was blown from the Prince of Wales at night and drowned.[35] Water was rationed as supplies ran low, and the supply of other goods including wine ran out altogether on some vessels.[35] Van Diemen's Land was sighted from the Friendship on 4 January 1788.[35] A freak storm struck as they began to head north around the island, damaging the sails and masts of some of the ships.\\r\\nOn 25 November, Phillip had transferred to the Supply. With Alexander, Friendship and Scarborough, the fastest ships in the Fleet, which were carrying most of the male convicts, the Supply hastened ahead to prepare for the arrival of the rest. Phillip intended to select a suitable location, find good water, clear the ground, and perhaps even have some huts and other structures built before the others arrived. This was a planned move, discussed by the Home Office and the Admiralty prior to the Fleet's departure.[36] However, this \\"flying squadron\\" reached Botany Bay only hours before the rest of the Fleet, so no preparatory work was possible.[37] Supply reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788; the three fastest transports in the advance group arrived on 19 January; slower ships, including Sirius, arrived on 20 January.[38]\\r\\nThis was one of the world's greatest sea voyages ÿ eleven vessels carrying about 1,487 people and stores[33] had travelled for 252 days for more than 15,000 miles (24,000?km) without losing a ship. Forty-eight people died on the journey, a death rate of just over three per cent.\\r\\nIt was soon realised that Botany Bay did not live up to the glowing account that the explorer Captain James Cook had provided.[39] The bay was open and unprotected, the water was too shallow to allow the ships to anchor close to the shore, fresh water was scarce, and the soil was poor.[40] First contact was made with the local indigenous people, the Eora, who seemed curious but suspicious of the newcomers. The area was studded with enormously strong trees. When the convicts tried to cut them down, their tools broke and the tree trunks had to be blasted out of the ground with gunpowder. The primitive huts built for the officers and officials quickly collapsed in rainstorms. The marines had a habit of getting drunk and not guarding the convicts properly, whilst their commander, Major Robert Ross, drove Phillip to despair with his arrogant and lazy attitude. Crucially, Phillip worried that his fledgling colony was exposed to attack from Aborigines or foreign powers. Although his initial instructions were to establish the colony at Botany Bay, he was authorised to establish the colony elsewhere if necessary.[41]\\r\\nOn 21 January, Phillip and a party which included John Hunter, departed the Bay in three small boats to explore other bays to the north.[43] Phillip discovered that Port Jackson, about 12 kilometres to the north, was an excellent site for a colony with sheltered anchorages, fresh water and fertile soil.[43] Cook had seen and named the harbour, but had not entered it.[43] Phillip's impressions of the harbour were recorded in a letter he sent to England later: \\"the finest harbour in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security ...\\". The party returned to Botany Bay on 23 January.[43]\\r\\nOn the morning of 24 January, the party was startled when two French ships were seen just outside Botany Bay. This was a scientific expedition led by Jean-Fran?ois de La Prouse. The French had expected to find a thriving colony where they could repair ships and restock supplies, not a newly arrived fleet of convicts considerably more poorly provisioned than themselves.[44] There was some cordial contact between the French and British officers, but Phillip and La Prouse never met. The French ships remained until 10 March before setting sail on their return voyage. They were not seen again and were later discovered to have been shipwrecked off the coast of Vanikoro in the present-day Solomon Islands.[45]\\r\\nOn 26 January 1788, the Fleet weighed anchor and sailed to Port Jackson.[25] The site selected for the anchorage had deep water close to the shore, was sheltered, and had a small stream flowing into it. Phillip named it Sydney Cove, after Lord Sydney the British Home Secretary.[43] This date is celebrated as Australia Day, marking the beginning of British settlement.[46] The British flag was planted and formal possession taken. This was done by Phillip and some officers and marines from the Supply, with the remainder of Supply's crew and the convicts observing from on board ship. The remaining ships of the Fleet did not arrive at Sydney Cove until later that day.[47]\\r\\nThe First Fleet encountered indigenous Australians when they landed at Botany Bay. The Cadigal people of the Botany Bay area witnessed the Fleet arrive and six days later the two ships of French explorer La Prouse sailed into the bay.[48] When the Fleet moved to Sydney Cove seeking better conditions for establishing the colony, they encountered the Eora people, including the Bidjigal clan. A number of the First Fleet journals record encounters with Aboriginal people.[49]\\r\\nAlthough the official policy of the British Government was to establish friendly relations with Aboriginal people,[41] and Arthur Phillip ordered that the Aboriginal people should be well treated, it was not long before conflict began. The colonists did not sign treaties with the original inhabitants of the land.[50] Between 1790 and 1810, Pemulwuy of the Bidjigal clan led the local people in a series of attacks against the British colonisers.[51]\\r\\nThe ships of the First Fleet mostly did not remain in the colony. Some returned to England, while others left for other ports. Some remained at the service of the Governor of the colony for some months: some of these were sent to Norfolk Island where a second penal colony was established.\\r\\n1788\\r\\n1789\\r\\n1790:\\r\\nOn 26 January 1842, the Colonial Government in Sydney awarded a life pension of 1 shilling a day to three surviving members of the First Fleet. The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser reported, on Saturday 29 January 1842: \\"The Government have ordered a pension of one shilling per diem to be paid to the survivors of those who came by the first vessel into the Colony. The number of these really 'old hands' is now reduced to three, of whom, two are now in the Benevolent Asylum, and the other is a fine hale old fellow, who can do a day's work with more spirit than many of the young fellows lately arrived in the Colony.\\"[53] The names of the three recipients are not given.\\r\\nWilliam Hubbard: Hubbard was convicted in the Kingston Assizes in Surrey, England, on 24 March 1784 for theft.[54] He was transported to Australia on the Scarborough in the First Fleet. He married Mary Goulding on 19 December 1790 in Rose Hill. In 1803 he received a land grant of 70 acres at Mulgrave Place. He died on 18 May 1843 at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum. His age was given as 76 when he was buried at Christ Church St. Lawrence, Sydney on 22 May 1843.\\r\\nJohn McCarthy: McCarthy was a Marine who sailed on the Friendship.[55] McCarthy was born in Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland, circa Christmas 1745. He first served in the colony of New South Wales, then at Norfolk Island where he took up a land grant of 60 acres (Lot 110). He married the first fleet convict Ann Beardsley on Norfolk Island in November 1791 after his discharge a month earlier. In 1808, on the close of Norfolk Island settlement, he resettled in Van Diemen's Land and later took a land grant (80 acres at Melville) in lieu of the one forfeited on Norfolk Island. The last few years of his life were spent at the home of his granddaughter and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. William H. Budd, at a place called Kinlochewe Inn near Donnybrook, Victoria. McCarthy died on 24 July 1846,[56] six months past his 100 birthday.\\r\\nJohn Limeburner: The South Australian Register reported, in an article dated Wednesday 3 November 1847: \\"John Limeburner, the oldest colonist in Sydney, died in September last, at the advanced age of 104 years. He helped to pitch the first tent in Sydney, and remembered the first display of the British flag there, which was hoisted on a swamp oak-tree, then growing on a spot now occupied as the Water-Police Court. He was the last of those called the 'first-fleeters' (arrivals by the first convict ships) and, notwithstanding his great age, retained his faculties to the last.\\"[57] John Limeburner was a convict on the Charlotte. He was convicted on 9 July 1785 at New Sarum, Wiltshire of theft of a waistcoat, a shirt and stockings.[58] He married Elizabeth Ireland in 1790 at Rosehill and together they establish a 50-acre farm at Prospect.[59] He died at Ashfield in September 1847 and is buried at St John's, Ashfield.\\r\\nJohn Jones: Jones was a Marine on the First Fleet and sailed on the Alexander. He is listed in the N.S.W. 1828 Census as aged 82 and living at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum.[60] He is said to have died at the Benevolent Asylum in 1848.[61]\\r\\nSamuel King: King was a scribbler (a worker in a scribbling mill[62]) before he became a Marine. He was a Marine with the First Fleet on board the flagship Sirius?(1786).[63] He shipped to Norfolk Island on Golden Grove in September 1788, where he lived with Mary Rolt, a convict who arrived with the First Fleet on the Prince of Wales. He received a grant of 60 acres (Lot No. 13) at Cascade Stream in 1791. Mary Rolt returned to England on the Britannia in October 1796. King was resettled in Van Diemen's Land, boarding the City of Edinburgh on 3 September 1808, and landed in Hobart on 3 October.[64] He married Elizabeth Thackery on 28 January 1810. He died on 21 October 1849 at 86 years of age and was buried in the Wesleyan cemetery at Lawitta Road, Back River.\\r\\nJohn Small: Convicted 14 March 1785 at the Devon Lent Assizes held at Exeter for Robbery King's Highway. Sentenced to hang, reprieved to 7 years transportation. Arrived on the Charlotte in First Fleet 1788. Certificate of freedom 1792. Land Grant 1794, 30 acre \\"Small's Farm\\" at Eastern Farms (Ryde). Married October 1788 Mary Parker also a First Fleet convict who arrived on Lady Penrhyn. John Small died on 2 October 1850 at age of 90 years.[65][66]\\r\\nElizabeth Thackery: Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" King (ne Thackery) was tried and convicted of theft on 4 May 1786 at Manchester Quarter Sessions, and sentenced to seven years transportation. She sailed on the Friendship, but was transferred to the Charlotte at the Cape of Good Hope. She was shipped to Norfolk Island on the Sirius?(1786) in 1790 and lived there with James Dodding. In August 1800 she bought 10 acres of land from Samuel King at Cascade Stream. Elizabeth and James were relocated to Van Diemen's Land in December 1807[67] but parted company sometime afterwards. On 28 January 1810 Elizabeth married \\"First Fleeter\\" Private Samuel King (above) and lived with him until his death in 1849. Betty King died in New Norfolk, Tasmania on 7 August 1856, aged 89 years. She is buried in the churchyard of the Methodist Chapel, Lawitta Road, Back River, next to her husband, and the marked grave bears a First Fleet plaque. She was one of the first British women to land in Australia and was the last \\"First Fleeter\\" to die.\\r\\nHistorians have disagreed over whether those aboard the First Fleet were responsible for introducing smallpox to Australia's indigenous population, and if so, whether this was the consequence of deliberate action.\\r\\nIn 1914, J.?H.?L. Cumpston, director of the Australian Quarantine Service put forward the hypothesis that smallpox arrived with British settlers.[68] Some researchers have argued that any such release may have been a deliberate attempt to decimate the indigenous population.[69][70] Others have suggested that live smallpox virus may have been introduced accidentally, when Aboriginal people came into contact with variolous matter brought by the First Fleet for use in anti-smallpox inoculations.[71][72][73] Hypothetical scenarios for such an action might have included: an act of revenge by an aggrieved individual, a response to attacks by indigenous people,[74] or part of an orchestrated assault by the New South Wales Marine Corps, intended to clear the path for colonial expansion.[75][76]\\r\\nOther historians have disputed the idea that there was a deliberate release of smallpox virus and/or suggest that it arrived with visitors to Australia other than the First Fleet.[77][78][79][80][81] In 2002, historian Judy Campbell suggested that smallpox had arrived in Australia through contact with fishermen from Makassar in Indonesia, where smallpox was endemic.[79][82] In 2011, Macknight stated: The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Indonesian] trepangers ... and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.[83]\\r\\nThere is a third theory, that the 1789 epidemic was not smallpox but chickenpox ÿ to which indigenous Australians also had no inherited resistance ÿ that happened to be affecting, or was carried by, members of the First Fleet.[84][85] This theory has also been disputed.[86][87]\\r\\nAfter Ray Collins, a stonemason, completed years of research into the First Fleet, he sought approval from about nine councils to construct a commemorative garden in recognition of these immigrants. Liverpool Plains Shire Council was ultimately the only council to accept his offer to supply the materials and construct the garden free of charge. The site chosen was a disused caravan park on the banks of Quirindi Creek at Wallabadah, New South Wales. In September 2002 Collins commenced work on the project. Additional support was later provided by Neil McGarry in the form of some signs and the council contributed $28,000 for pathways and fencing. Collins hand-chiseled the names of all those who came to Australia on the eleven ships in 1788 on stone tablets along the garden pathways. The stories of those who arrived on the ships, their life, and first encounters with the Australian country are presented throughout the garden.[88] On 26 January 2005, the First Fleet Garden was opened as the major memorial to the First Fleet immigrants. Previously the only other specific memorial to the First Fleeters was an obelisk at Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales.[89] The surrounding area has a barbecue, tables, and amenities.","input":"When was the first fleet sent to australia?"},{"output":"Delta Nu","context":"Legally Blonde is a 2001 American comedy film based on the novel of the same name by Amanda Brown.

Elle is taken to an expensive restaurant by her boyfriend, the governor's son, Warner Huntington III. She expects Warner to propose marriage, but he breaks up with her instead, reasoning that she is not serious enough for his political aspirations. Her sorority sisters encourage her to pursue him. After reading a magazine article about Warner's brother getting engaged to a socialite, Elle decides to enroll into law school in order to win back Warner. After much effort, Elle scores a 179 out of 180 on the Law School Admission Test. Her score, combined with her 4.0 GPA, admissions essay video, and strong extracurricular activities, gains her admission into Harvard Law School, where Warner has enrolled.\\r\\nUpon arriving at Harvard, Elle's SoCal personality is in complete contrast to her East Coast classmates' personalities, who refuse to take her seriously. She soon encounters Warner and asks him to meet her later after her first class. Elle struggles to keep up with the reading and is unprepared for a lecture, which causes strict Professor Stromwell, as well as another student Vivian Kensington, to berate her and force her out of the class. Outside in the courtyard, Elle meets Emmett, an associate at Harvard who gives her advice on handling each of her professors. She then meets up with Warner but discovers he's engaged to Vivian, the girl who humiliated her in Stromwell's class. Leaving in a huff, Elle finds the nearest salon to ease her anger and meets Paulette, a beautician who befriends her as she herself recollects all the times a man has rejected her. Paulettes dog Rufus has been confiscated from her and is now in the hands of her ex. Elle tearfully tells Paulette her situation and Paulette encourages her to \\"steal the bastard back.\\"\\r\\nElle tries to blend in with the others, even making an effort to join Warner and his friends in a study group but was unsuccessful. She overhears Vivian inviting people to a party and tells Elle that it was a \\"costume party\\" and says that she can come. Elle arrives to the party in a Playboy bunny suit but sees that the party is not a costume party. Elle tells Warner that she intends to apply for Professor Callahan's prestigious internship, but Warner tells her that she is not smart enough and is wasting her time. Elle realizes that Warner will never take her back and finds motivation to prove herself. She does this by helping Paulette reclaim her dog from her ex Dewey Newcomb, stating that their long relationship counts as a common-law marriage, and Paulette should be allowed to keep her dog.\\r\\nAfter several months of dramatic improvement, Elle, along with Warner, Vivian and another student Enid Wexler, is given a surprise internship at Callahan's law office. Callahan is defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, who is one of Elle's role models and a former member of her sorority. Accused of murdering her wealthy husband, Brooke is unwilling to produce an alibi. She later tells Elle that she was having liposuction at the time of her husband's murder but refused to tell Callahan and the media for fearing it will destroy her career. Discussing the trial, the defending team tries to persuade Elle to reveal Brooke's alibi, which she refuses to do. Warner attempts to convince her, saying if she shares the alibi that Callahan might hire her as a summer associate and to not worry about Brooke and to think about herself. Vivian overhearing this is disgusted with Warner's lack of empathy and ethical stance as a means to get ahead.\\r\\nElle and Emmett get assigned by Callahan to meet the murder victim's ex-wife at a spa to question her about Brooke. The ex-wife claims that Brooke was a bad stepmother to her daughter Chutney and that Brooke had her eye on the family's pool cleaner, but Elle doesn't believe her. As Elle returns to her dorm-room, she encounters one of her kind, but awkward, classmates attempting to ask a girl on a date. The girl says no and humiliates him. Elle interrupts and feigns having an amazing sexual encounter together in a successful effort to make him seem more desirable. Vivian approaches Elle's dorm to compliment her integrity during the trial. Clearly disturbed by Warner's behavior earlier, she continues to bond with Elle while they make fun of Warner's privileged upbringing and reveals that Warner was put on the wait list when he first applied to Harvard and his father \\"had to make a call,\\" much to Elle's surprise.\\r\\nBack at the salon, the UPS delivery man catches Paulettes eye, and Paulette is speechless, not knowing how to communicate with him because shes that attracted to him. Elle asks Paulette if this was their first time actually talking to each other, and while Paulette is still speechless, Elle decides to teach her, along with the rest of the salon, a technique she learned to captivate boys, called the Bend and Snap. Soon Elle is seen teaching the entire salon the Bend and Snap in a hilarious montage, and when Paulette meets eyes with the UPS guy again, she tries the new move on him and ends up breaking his nose in the process.\\r\\nAt the trial, Enrique Salvatore, the pool cleaner and the prosecution's main witness, says that he was having an affair with Brooke and that they were planning to run off with her husband's money. Elle deduces that Enrique is gay because he knew the designer brand of the shoes she was wearing, and points out to Emmett that gay men normally know designers and that straight men don't. Brooke recalls that he had once left a 'Cher' tape in the pool house. Armed with this knowledge, Emmett, after cross examination, redirects and then tricks Enrique into outing himself by admitting he has a boyfriend named Chuck; while attempting to deny the revelation, Chuck himself stands up and effeminately shouts \\"You Bitch!\\" before storming out of the courtroom. In an uproar, the judge calls for order and dismisses Enrique while the trial resumes.\\r\\nApparently impressed, Callahan asks Elle to meet him in his office later that evening. In his office that evening, Callahan makes a pass at Elle while offering to \\"discuss the future of her career.\\" Vivian, approaching the office, saw Callahan trying to seduce Elle, and assuming that Elle was willing and had been relying on her attractiveness to succeed. Vivian storms out of Callahan's office, telling Elle that the only reason Elle has gotten this far is because of her attractiveness. Despondent, Elle decides to quit the internship.\\r\\nAs she was preparing to move back to California, Elle stops at the salon to say goodbye to Paulette. She tells her that, despite other people not taking her seriously, the internship made her feel confident about herself but that Callahan only gave it to her because he wanted to have sex with her. As she was about to drop out of law school and leave, Professor Stromwell, who happened to be at the salon, reassures and motivates her to want to stay. Later on, Emmett explains to Brooke how Callahan's behavior caused Elle to quit her internship, and Vivian now regrets her judgment of Elle. Brooke happily fires Callahan as she enters the courtroom and reveals Elle as his replacement for her defense. Despite her law student status, Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court ruling 3.03 allows Elle to legally appear on a defendant's behalf under the supervision of a licensed attorney. Callahan refuses to sponsor her, but Emmett immediately accepts to supervise instead. Nervous at first, Elle cross-examines Brooke's step-daughter Chutney. Chutney claims she did not hear the gun shot because she was upstairs taking a shower at the time of the apparent murder. Elle catches Chutney in a lie when she says she had gotten a perm done less than 24 hours prior to the incident. Elle confidently lures Chutney to expose her faulty alibi and correctly points out that applying water and shampoo to the hair within the 24 hour period deactivates the ammonium thioglycolate used in perming hair. She continues to cross-examine Chutney on how anyone who had sustained as many as 30+ perm treatments in their life would be \\"well aware of this rule\\". Now in a panic, Chutney tears up and unwittingly reveals that she intended to shoot Brooke but accidentally shot and killed her father by mistake, thinking it was Brooke that entered the house.\\r\\nElle had won her first case and all the charges against Brooke are dismissed. Chutney is taken into custody. Warner approaches Elle and tells her that he loves her and tries to convince her to take him back. She rejects his advances and mocks him by repeating his earlier line that she wasn't serious enough for him, and cuts her ties with him. Two years later, Elle graduates from Harvard and gives the graduation speech. Vivian broke off her engagement to Warner and is now Elle's best friend. Warner has graduated with no honors, no girlfriend, and no job offers. Paulette ended up marrying the UPS guy, and they are expecting their first child together, a girl they plan to name after Elle. Emmett has started his own firm and he and Elle have been dating since the trial, and he plans to propose to her later that night.\\r\\nPrincipal photography took place from 10 October until 19 December 2000\\r\\nAlthough the film is set at Harvard University, it was filmed at the University of Southern California,[6] University of California, Los Angeles,[7] California Institute of Technology, and Rose City High School in Pasadena, California. The graduation scene was filmed at Dulwich College in London, England, since Witherspoon was in that city filming The Importance of Being Earnest.

While company headquarters remain in Louisiana, a second restaurant support office was opened in Plano, Texas in 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nTodd Graves first started dreaming of his very own restaurant in the early 1990s. Craig Silvey, an initial partner in Todd's plan, was enrolled in a business plan writing course at LSU at the time. They wrote the business plan and Silvey turned it in, for which Silvey received a \\"B-\\".[1] Although the business plan was rejected numerous times by potential investors, Graves set out to earn the money he needed to start the restaurant, first by working in refineries in California, then by fishing for sockeye salmon in Alaska. He and Silvey then obtained an SBA loan, which they used to open the first restaurant in Baton Rouge at the intersection of Highland Road and State Street near the LSU campus. They even drew on the help of friends and family for some of the work on Cane's 1, and many of these names are carved in the restaurant woodwork. Originally, the small restaurant competed against a similarly themed drive-in called Bailey's Chicken Fingers on the opposite end of the campus. By 1999, however, it was able to prove itself the more successful business: it forced Bailey's out of business, becoming the only chicken-finger focused restaurant in the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mid-1999, Silvey sold his stake to Graves to focus on completing an MBA at Wake Forest University and work in Silicon Valley. Later, Graves asked Silvey to return as vice president of finance and information technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2008, the chain had grown to over 50 locations. Most of the locations are in Louisiana, particularly in the Baton Rouge area. The first location outside of Baton Rouge was opened in 2001 in Lafayettesince then, new restaurants have been opened in 23 other states, in addition to all eight metropolitan areas of Louisiana. Graves plans to continue expansion of the chain throughout the United States and internationally, one each in Kuwait (opened September 2015) & Bahrain (opened September 2016), plus three in Saudi Arabia (first had opened February 2017), Lebanon (opened December 2017) & United Arab Emirates (opened in March 2018). Today there are over 380 stores in 24 states.[2] Tennessee opened one in Knoxville in September 2014. California has 11 West Coast stores, most of them in Orange County: the first opened in late October 2015 in Costa Mesa; the second in early December in Aliso Viejo; the third in early March 2016 in Orange; the fourth had opened in mid-June in Laguna Hills; the fifth opened in mid-February 2018 in La Habra, the state's 8th. There are two Los Angeles County stores: one in Downey (opened August 2016) and another in Lakewood (opened March 2018) which are the state's 4th & 9th, respectively. There is currently one under construction being built in the city of Pico Rivera, which will open in early 2019. Riverside County opened the state's 6th store in Riverside in October 2017. San Bernardino County's two stores are in San Bernardino, which opened in mid-January 2018, the state's 7th; the other is in Ontario, opened in early July, the state's 11th. San Diego County's lone store is in Santee, opened in May, the state's 10th; another is set to open in Vista, in mid-July. Besides Pico Rivera, 3 others are planned to open later in the year: Menifee, Temecula & Upland.[citation needed] Kansas has 4 stores: one in Lawrence (opened May 2016); Overland Park (opened October 2016); Shawnee (opened August 2017) & Manhattan (opened June 2018). Iowa has two stores: one in Council Bluffs (opened October 2016) and another in West Des Moines (opened May 2018). Illinois has 6 stores, all but one in Cook County: they opened its very first in North Riverside, a Chicago suburb in late January 2017; the second opened in mid-February in Oak Lawn; the third opened in Naperville in late April; the 4th had opened in Harwood Heights in late September; the 5th had opened in Evergreen Park in late October; the Windy City itself opened one near Loyola campus in March 2018, the state's 6th. New Mexico's first location opened in Las Cruces in mid-February, the chain's 24th state; and will plan to open more in Albuquerque & Santa Fe in the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Panda Restaurant Group, led by mogul Andrew Cherng, the chain plans to add restaurants in Alaska & Hawaii later in the year.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2009, the company opened a second restaurant support office in Plano, Texas.[4]\\r\\nIn June 2011 it opened its 100th restaurant in Laurel, Mississippi. In February 2013 it opened its 150th location in San Antonio, Texas. The milestone 250th location opened in December 2015 in Lake Jackson, Texas. By November 2016 Houston, Texas hosted the milestone 300th restaurant's opening, on Rice & Westpark Tollway; and in late October 2017 Stillwater, Oklahoma was the site of the milestone 350th store.\\r\\n\\r\\nCEO Graves and the chain have given more than 25 percent of their profits back to the communities where restaurants operate with an emphasis on schools, food banks, active lifestyles, canine assistance and business and entrepreneur organizations.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nGraves and Silvey, who both worked as salmon fishermen in Alaska to raise money to open the first Raising Cane's restaurant, were going to name the chain Sockeye's Chicken Fingers, after the Sockeye salmon they fished for. They were later convinced to name it after Graves's dog, a yellow Labrador, \\"Raising Cane,\\" called \\"Cane\\" for short. \\"Raising Cane I\\" died of old age, Raising Cane II died on 11 September 2016, and the most recent mascot for the restaurant, Raising Cane III, was announced by Graves on 27 January 2018. [6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Raising Cane's was established in Baton Rouge, Louisiana at the North Gates of Louisiana State University, at the intersection of East State Street and Highland Road. When remodeling the building, Graves discovered a hand painted sign featuring the logo from a previous business, Wolf's Bakery, under the cracking plaster on the south interior wall. It is a takeoff on the one for the bakery. The remains are still visible and intact on the wall inside the restaurant.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaising Cane's offers a limited menu consisting of four main combos: \\"The Box Combo,\\" \\"The 3-Finger Combo,\\" \\"The Caniac Combo\\" and \\"The Sandwich Combo.\\" It also includes a Kid's Meal and several sizes of bulk chicken items called Tailgates.

It is also known as Nek Chand's Rock Garden after its founder Nek Chand, a government official who started the garden secretly in his spare time in 1957. Today it is spread over an area of 40 acres (161874.25?m2). It is completely built of industrial and home waste and thrown-away items.[1][2]\\r\\nIt is near Sukhna Lake.[3] It consists of man-made interlinked waterfalls and many other sculptures that have been made of scrap and other kinds of wastes (bottles, glasses, bangles, tiles, ceramic pots, sinks, electrical waste,brokenpipes, etc.) which are placed in walled paths.[citation needed][4]\\r\\nIn his spare time, Nek Chand started collecting materials from demolition sites around the city. He recycled these materials into his own vision of the divine kingdom of Sukrani, choosing a gorge in a forest near Sukhna Lake for his work. The gorge had been designated as a land conservancy, a forest buffer established in 1902 that nothing could be built on. Chands work was illegal, but he was able to hide it for 18 years before it was discovered by the authorities in 1975. By this time, it had grown into a 12-acre (49,000?m2) complex of interlinked courtyards, each filled with hundreds of pottery-covered concrete sculptures of dancers, musicians, and animals.[5]\\r\\nHis work was in danger of being demolished, but he was able to get public opinion on his side. In 1976 the park was inaugurated as a public space. Nek Chand was given a salary, a title (\\"Sub-Divisional Engineer, Rock Garden\\"), and 50 laborers so that he could concentrate full-time on his work. It appeared on an Indian stamp in 1983.[6] The Rock Garden is still made out of recycled materials. With the governments help, Chand was able to set up collection centers around the city for waste, especially rags and broken ceramics.[7][8]\\r\\nWhen Chand left the country on a lecture tour in 1996, the city withdrew its funding, and vandals attacked the park.

It has been defined as \\"the art of directing the simultaneous performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture.\\"[1] The primary duties of the conductor are to interpret the score created by a composer in a manner which is reflective of the specific indications within that score, set the tempo, ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and to \\"shape\\" the phrasing where appropriate.[2] To convey their ideas and interpretation, conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a baton, and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers.[3] A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.[3]\\r\\nThe conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score, which contains the musical notation for all the instruments or voices. Since the mid-19th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of classical music history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In Baroque music from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist (see concertmaster), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in art music, but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a \\"count in\\"). However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.\\r\\nConductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their scores, to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,[4] planning a concert season, hearing auditions and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. Orchestras, choirs, concert bands and other sizable musical ensembles such as big bands are usually led by conductors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal conductor of an orchestra or opera company is sometimes referred to as a music director or chief conductor, or by the German words Kapellmeister or Dirigent. Conductors of choirs or choruses are sometimes referred to as choral director, chorus master, or choirmaster, particularly for choirs associated with an orchestra. Conductors of concert bands, military bands, marching bands and other bands may hold the title of band director, bandmaster, or drum major. Respected senior conductors are sometimes referred to by the Italian word, maestro (\\"master\\" as in \\"one who has mastered the art\\").\\r\\nAn early form of conducting is cheironomy, the use of hand gestures to indicate melodic shape. This has been practiced at least as far back as the Middle Ages. In the Christian church, the person giving these symbols held a staff to signify his role, and it seems that as music became rhythmically more complex, the staff was moved up and down to indicate the beat, acting as an early form of baton.\\r\\nIn the 17th century, other devices to indicate the passing of time came into use. Rolled up sheets of paper, smaller sticks and unadorned hands are all shown in pictures from this period. The large staff was responsible for the death of Jean-Baptiste Lully, who injured his foot with one while conducting a Te Deum for the King's recovery from illness. The wound became gangrenous and Lully refused amputation, whereupon the gangrene spread to his leg and he died two months later.[5]\\r\\nIn instrumental music throughout the 18th century, a member of the ensemble usually acted as the conductor. This was sometimes the concertmaster, who could use his bow as a baton, or a lutenist who would move the neck of his instrument in time with the beat. It was common to conduct from the harpsichord in pieces that had a basso continuo part. In opera performances, there were sometimes two conductors ÿ the keyboard player was in charge of the singers, and the principal violinist or leader was in charge of the orchestra.\\r\\nBy the early 19th century (ca. 1820), it became the norm to have a dedicated conductor, who did not also play an instrument during the performance. While some orchestras protested the introduction of the conductor, since they were used to having a concertmaster or keyboard player act as leader, eventually the role of a conductor was established. The size of the usual orchestra expanded during this period, and the use of a baton became more common, as it was easier to see than bare hands or rolled-up paper. Among the earliest notable conductors were Louis Spohr, Carl Maria von Weber, Louis-Antoine Jullien and Felix Mendelssohn, all of whom were also composers. Mendelssohn is claimed to have been the first conductor to utilize a wooden baton to keep time, a practice still generally in use in the 2010s. Prominent conductors who did not or do not use a baton include Pierre Boulez, Kurt Masur, James Conlon, Yuri Temirkanov,[6] Leopold Stokowski, Vasily Safonov, Eugene Ormandy (for a period), and Dimitri Mitropoulos.[7]\\r\\nThe composers Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner attained greatness as conductors, and they wrote two of the earliest essays dedicated to the subject. Berlioz is considered the first virtuoso conductor. Wagner was largely responsible for shaping the conductor's role as one who imposes his own view of a piece onto the performance rather than one who is just responsible for ensuring entries are made at the right time and that there is a unified beat. Predecessors who focused on conducting include Fran?ois Habeneck, who founded the Orchestre de la Socit des concerts du Conservatoire in 1828, though Berlioz was later to be alarmed at Habeneck's loose standards of rehearsal. Pianist and composer Franz Liszt was also a conductor.\\r\\nWagner's one-time champion Hans von Blow (1830ÿ1894) was particularly celebrated as a conductor, although he also maintained his initial career as a pianist, an instrument on which he was regarded as among the greatest performers (he was a prized piano student of Franz Liszt, whose daughter Cosima he married ÿ although she was to abandon him for Wagner. Liszt was a major figure in the history of conducting, who attained remarkable performances).\\r\\nBlow raised the technical standards of conducting to an unprecedented level through such innovations as separate, detailed rehearsals of different sections of the orchestra (\\"sectional rehearsal\\"). In his posts as head of (sequentially) the Bavarian State Opera, Meiningen Court Orchestra, and Berlin Philharmonic he brought a level of nuance and subtlety to orchestral performance previously heard only in solo instrumental playing, and in doing so made a profound impression on young artists like Richard Strauss, who at the age of 20 served as his assistant, and Felix Weingartner, who came to disapprove of his interpretations but was deeply impressed by his orchestral standards. Composer Gustav Mahler was also a noted conductor.\\r\\nThe next generation of conductors brought technical standards to new levels; perhaps most notable was the Hungarian-born Arthur Nikisch (1855ÿ1922), who succeeded Blow as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1895. He had previously served as head of the Leipzig Opera, Boston Symphony Orchestra, and Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, and was to serve as music director of the London Symphony Orchestra. Nikisch premiered important works by Anton Bruckner and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who greatly admired his work; Johannes Brahms, after hearing him conduct his Fourth Symphony, said it was \\"quite exemplary, it's impossible to hear it any better.\\"\\r\\nNikisch took the London Symphony Orchestra on tour through the United States in April 1912, the first American tour by a European orchestra. He also made one of the earliest recordings of a complete symphony: the Beethoven Fifth with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1913. Nikisch was also the first conductor to have his art captured on film ÿ alas, silently. The film confirms reports that he made particularly mesmerizing use of eye contact and expression to communicate with an orchestra; such later conductors as Fritz Reiner stated that this aspect of his technique had a strong influence on their own.\\r\\nConductors of the generations after Nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence of their arts. Two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often treated, somewhat inaccurately, as interpretive antipodes. They were the Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini (1867ÿ1957) and the German conductor Wilhelm Furtw?ngler (1886ÿ1954). Toscanini played in orchestras under Giuseppe Verdi and made his debut conducting Aida in 1886, filling in at the last minute for an indisposed conductor. He is to this day regarded by such authorities as James Levine as the greatest of all Verdi conductors. But Toscanini's repertory was wide, and it was in his interpretations of the German symphonists Beethoven and Brahms that he was particularly renowned and influential, favoring stricter and faster tempi than a conductor like Blow or, before him, Wagner. Still, his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest, and he was particularly gifted at revealing detail and getting orchestras to play in a singing manner.\\r\\nFurtw?ngler, whom many regard as the greatest interpreter of Wagner (although Toscanini was also admired in this composer) and Bruckner, conducted Beethoven and Brahms with a good deal of inflection of tempo ÿ but generally in a manner that revealed the structure and direction of the music particularly clearly. He was an accomplished composer as well as performer, and a disciple of the theorist Heinrich Schenker, who emphasized concern for underlying long-range harmonic tensions and resolutions in a piece, a strength of Furtw?ngler's conducting. Along with his interest in the large-scale, Furtw?ngler also shaped the details of the piece in a particularly compelling and expressive manner.\\r\\nThe two men had very different techniques: Toscanini's was Italianate, with a long, large baton and clear beats (often not using his left hand); Furtw?ngler beat time with less apparent precision, because he wanted a more rounded sound (although it is a myth that his technique was vague; many musicians have attested that he was easy to follow in his own way). In any event, their examples illustrate a larger point about conducting technique in the first half of the 20th century: it was not standardized. Great and influential conductors of the middle 20th century like Leopold Stokowski (1882ÿ1977), Otto Klemperer (1885ÿ1973), Herbert von Karajan (1908ÿ1989) and Leonard Bernstein (1918ÿ1990) ÿ incidentally, the first American conductor to attain greatness and international fame ÿ had widely varied techniques.\\r\\nKarajan and Bernstein formed another apparent antipode in the 1960sÿ80s, Karajan as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic (1955ÿ89) and Bernstein as, for part of that period, music director of the New York Philharmonic (1957ÿ69), and later frequent guest conductor in Europe. Karajan's technique was highly controlled, and eventually he conducted with his eyes often closed; Bernstein's technique was demonstrative, with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements. Karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet, while Bernstein was known at times to leap into the air at a great climax. As the music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, Karajan cultivated warm, blended beauty of tone, which has sometimes been criticized as too uniformly applied; by contrast, in Bernstein's only appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1979 ÿ performing Mahler's Symphony No. 9 ÿ he tried to get the orchestra to produce an \\"ugly\\" tone in a certain passage in which he believed it suited the expressive meaning of the music (the first horn player refused, and finally agreed to let an understudy play instead of himself).\\r\\nBoth Karajan and Bernstein made extensive use of advances in media to convey their art, but in tellingly different ways. Bernstein hosted major prime-time national television series to educate and reach out to children and the public at large about classical music; Karajan made a series of films late in his life, but in them, he did not talk. Both made numerous recordings, but their attitudes toward recording differed: Karajan frequently made new studio recordings to take advantage of advances in recording technique, which fascinated him ÿ he played a role in setting the specifications of the compact disc ÿ but Bernstein, in his post-New York days, came to insist on (for the most part) live concert recordings, believing that music-making did not come to life in a studio without an audience.\\r\\nIn the last third of the 20th century, conducting technique ÿ particularly with the right hand and the baton ÿ became increasingly standardized. Conductors like Willem Mengelberg in Amsterdam until the end of World War II had had extensive rehearsal time to mold orchestras very precisely, and thus could have idiosyncratic techniques; modern conductors, who spend less time with any given orchestra, must get results with much less rehearsal time. A more standardized technique allows communication to be much more rapid. Nonetheless, conductors' techniques still show a great deal of variety, particularly with the use of the left hand, facial and eye expression, and body language.\\r\\nWomen conductors were almost unheard of in the ranks of leading orchestral conductors through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, but today, artists like Hortense von Gelmini?(de),[8] Marin Alsop and Simone Young have broken the gender barrier. Alsop was appointed music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in 2007 ÿ the first woman ever appointed to head a major US orchestra ÿ and also of the Orquestra Sinf?nica do Estado de S?o Paulo in 2012, and Alsop was the first woman to conduct on the last night of The Proms. Young scored similar firsts when she became head of the Hamburg State Opera and Philharmoniker Hamburg in 2005; she is also the first woman conductor to record the Ring Cycle of Richard Wagner. The Guardian called conducting \\"one of the last glass ceilings in the music industry\\".[9] A 2013 article stated that in France, out of 574 concerts only 17 were conducted by women and no women conducted at the National Opra in Paris.[10] \\"Bachtrack reported that, in a list of the world's 150 top conductors that year, only five were women.\\"[11]\\r\\nWhile Mexico has produced several major international conductors, Alondra de la Parra has become the first Mexican-born woman to attain distinction in the profession. Similarly, Asian origin has become unremarkable, because of the international successes of conductors from the Far East such as Seiji Ozawa, who was the Boston Symphony Orchestra's music director from 1973 until 2002 after holding similar posts in San Francisco and Toronto, and Myung-Whun Chung, who has held major posts in Germany and France and now is bringing the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra to international attention. There is still under-representation of artists of black origin in the conducting profession, but there have been notable exceptions, such as Henry Lewis, Dean Dixon, James DePreist, Paul Freeman, and Michael Morgan. For more information on black conductors, see Black conductors. According to a 2004 article in The Guardian, \\"black conductors are rare in the classical music world and even in symphony orchestras it is unusual to see more than one or two black musicians.\\"[12]\\r\\nConducting is a means of communicating artistic directions to performers during a performance. Although there are many formal rules on how to conduct correctly, others are subjective, and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication of the conductor. The primary responsibilities of the conductor are to unify performers, set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats, listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble, and to control the interpretation and pacing of the music. Communication is non-verbal during a performance, however in rehearsal frequent interruptions allow directions as to how the music should be played. During rehearsals, the conductor may stop the playing of a piece to request changes in the phrasing or request a change in the timbre of a certain section. In amateur orchestras, the rehearsals are often stopped to draw the musicians' attentions to performance errors or transposition mistakes.\\r\\nConducting requires an understanding of the elements of musical expression (tempo, dynamics, articulation) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble. The ability to communicate nuances of phrasing and expression through gestures is also beneficial. Conducting gestures are preferably prepared beforehand by the conductor while studying the score, but may sometimes be spontaneous.\\r\\nA distinction is sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting. Typically, orchestral conductors use a baton more often than choral conductors. The grip of the baton varies from conductor to conductor.\\r\\nAt the beginning of a piece of music, the conductor raises his or her hands (or hand if he or she only uses a single hand) to indicate that the piece is about to begin. This is a signal for the orchestra members to ready their instruments to be played or for the choristers to be ready and watching. The conductor then looks at the different sections of the orchestra (winds, strings, etc.) or choir to ensure that all the orchestra members are ready to play and choir members are ready. In some choral works, the conductor may signal to a pianist or organist to play a note or chord so that the choir members can determine their starting notes. Then the conductor gives one or more preparatory beats to commence the music. The preparatory beat before the orchestra or choir begins is the upbeat. The beat of the music is typically indicated with the conductor's right hand, with or without a baton. The hand traces a shape in the air in every bar (measure) depending on the time signature, indicating each beat with a change from downward to upward motion.[13] The images show the most common beat patterns, as seen from the conductor's point of view.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe downbeat indicates the first beat of the bar, and the upbeat indicates the beat before the first note of the piece and the last beat of the bar. The instant at which the beat occurs is called the ictus (plural: icts or ictuses), and is usually indicated by a sudden (though not necessarily large) click of the wrist or change in baton direction. In some instances, \\"ictus\\" is also used to refer to a horizontal plane in which all the ictuses are physically located, such as the top of a music stand where a baton is tapped at each ictus. The gesture leading up to the ictus is called the \\"preparation\\", and the continuous flow of steady beats is called the \\"takt\\" (the German word for bar, measure and beat).\\r\\nIf the tempo is slow or slowing, or if the time signature is compound, a conductor will sometimes indicate \\"subdivisions\\" of the beats. The conductor can do this by adding a smaller movement in the same direction as the movement for the beat that it belongs to.\\r\\nChanges to the tempo are indicated by changing the speed of the beat. To carry out and to control a rallentando (slowing down the pace of the music), a conductor may introduce beat subdivisions.\\r\\nWhile some conductors use both hands to indicate the beat, with the left hand mirroring the right, formal education discourages such an approach. The second hand can be used for cueing the entrances of individual players or sections, and to aid indications of dynamics, phrasing, expression, and other elements.\\r\\nDuring an instrumental solo section (or, in an opera orchestra during a vocalist's unaccompanied solo), some conductors stop counting out all the subdivisions and simply tap the baton down once per bar, to aid performers who are counting bars of rests.\\r\\nThere is a difference between the \\"textbook\\" definition of where the ictus of a downbeat occurs and the actual performance practice in professional orchestras. With an abrupt, loud sforzando chord, a professional orchestra will often play slightly after the striking of the ictus point of the baton stroke.\\r\\nDynamics are indicated in various ways. The dynamic may be communicated by the size of the conducting movements, larger shapes representing louder sounds. Changes in dynamic may be signalled with the hand that is not being used to indicate the beat: an upward motion (usually palm-up) indicates a crescendo; a downward motion (usually palm-down) indicates a diminuendo. Changing the size of conducting movements frequently results in changes in the character of the music depending upon the circumstances.\\r\\nDynamics can be fine-tuned using various gestures: showing one's palm to the performers or leaning away from them may demonstrate a decrease in volume. To adjust the overall balance of the various instruments or voices, these signals can be combined or directed toward a particular section or performer.\\r\\nThe indication of entries, when a performer or section should begin playing (perhaps after a long period of rests), is called \\"cueing\\". A cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment of the coming ictus, so that all the players or singers affected by the cue can begin playing simultaneously. Cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time. Cueing is also helpful in the case of a pedal point with string players, when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period; a cue is important to indicate when they should change to a new note. Cueing is achieved by \\"engaging\\" the players before their entry (by looking at them) and executing a clear preparation gesture, often directed toward the specific players. An inhalation, which may or may not be a semi-audible \\"sniff\\" from the conductor, is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors. Mere eye contact or a look in the general direction of the players may be sufficient in many instances, as when more than one section of the ensemble enters at the same time. Larger musical events may warrant the use of a larger or more emphatic cue designed to encourage emotion and energy.\\r\\nArticulation may be indicated by the character of the ictus, ranging from short and sharp for staccato, to long and fluid for legato. Many conductors change the tension of the hands: strained muscles and rigid movements may correspond to marcato, while relaxed hands and soft movements may correspond to legato or espressivo. Phrasing may be indicated by wide overhead arcs or by a smooth hand motion either forwards or side-to-side. A held note is often indicated by a hand held flat with palm up. The end of a note, called a \\"cutoff\\" or \\"release\\", may be indicated by a circular motion, the closing of the palm, or the pinching of finger and thumb. A release is usually preceded by a preparation and concluded with a complete stillness.\\r\\nConductors aim to maintain eye contact with the ensemble as much as possible, encouraging eye contact in return and increasing the dialogue between players/singers and conductor. Facial expressions may also be important to demonstrate the character of the music or to encourage the players.\\r\\nIn some cases, such as where there has been little rehearsal time to prepare a piece, a conductor may discreetly indicate how the bars of music will be beat immediately before the start of the movement by holding up their fingers in front of their chest (so only the performers can see). For example, in a 4\\r\\n4 piece that the conductor will beat \\"in two\\" (two ictus points or beats per bar, as if it were 2\\r\\n2), the conductor would hold up two fingers in front of his or her chest.\\r\\nIn most cases, there is a short pause between movements of a symphony, concerto or dance suite. This brief pause gives orchestra or choir members time to turn the pages of their part and ready themselves for the start of the next movement. String players may apply rosin or wipe sweat off their hands with a handkerchief. Reed players may take this time to change to a new reed. In some cases, woodwind or brass players will use the pause to switch to a different instrument (e.g., from trumpet to cornet or from clarinet to E? clarinet). If the conductor wishes to immediately begin one movement after another for musical reasons, this is called attacca. The conductor will instruct the orchestra members and choristers to write the term in their parts, so that they will be ready to go immediately to the next movement.\\r\\nThe roles of a conductor vary a great deal between different conducting positions and different ensembles. In some cases, a conductor will also be the musical director of the symphony, choosing the program for the entire season, including concerts by guest conductors, concerto soloists, pop concerts, and so on. A senior conductor may attend some or all of the auditions for new members of the orchestra, to ensure that the candidates have the playing style and tone that the conductor prefers and that candidates meet the highest performance standards. Some choral conductors are hired to prepare a choir for several weeks which will subsequently be directed by another conductor. The choral conductor is usually acknowledged for their preparatory work in the concert program.\\r\\nSome conductors may have a significant public relations role, giving interviews to the local news channel and appearing on television talk shows to promote the upcoming season or particular concerts. On the other hand, a conductor hired to guest conduct a single concert may only have the responsibility of rehearsing the orchestra for several pieces and conducting one or two concerts. While a handful of conductors have become well-known celebrities, such as Leonard Bernstein, most are only known within the Classical music scene.\\r\\nClassical choral and instrumental conducting have established comprehensive systems of instruction and training. Aspiring conductors can study at colleges, conservatories, and universities. Conservatories, which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur conducting experience. Universities offer a range of conducting programs, including courses in conducting as part of bachelor's degrees, a small number of Master of Music degrees in conducting, and an even smaller number of Doctor of Musical Arts degrees in conducting.\\r\\nAs well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and training festivals, which give students the opportunity to conduct a wide range of music. Aspiring conductors need to obtain a broad education about the history of music, including the major periods of classical music and regarding music theory. Many conductors learn to play a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the pipe organ, a skill that helps them to be able to analyze symphonies and try out their interpretations before they have access to an orchestra to conduct. Many conductors get experience playing in an orchestra or singing in a choir, an experience which gives them good insights into how orchestras and choirs are conducted and rehearsed.\\r\\nIn 2014, orchestra conductors typically hold a master's degree in music and choir conductors in the US typically hold a bachelor's degree in music.[14] Bachelor's degrees (referred to as B.Mus. or B.M) are four-year programs that include conducting lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Students do not usually specialize in conducting at the B.Mus. stage; instead, they usually develop general music skills such as singing, playing an orchestral instrument, performing in a choir, playing in orchestra, and playing a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the organ.\\r\\nAnother topic that conducting students study is the languages used in Classical music opera. Orchestral conductors are expected to be able to rehearse and lead choirs in works for orchestra and choir. As such, orchestral conductors need to know the major languages used in choral writing (including French, Italian and Latin, among others) and they must understand the correct diction of these languages in a choral singing context. The opposite is also true: a choral conductor will be expected to rehearse and lead a string orchestra or full orchestra when performing works for choir and orchestra. As such, a choral conductor needs to know how to rehearse and lead instrument sections.\\r\\nMaster of music degrees (M.mus.) in conducting consist of private conducting lessons, ensemble experience, coaching, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two conducted concerts. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an M.Mus. or M.M.) is often the required minimum credential for people who wish to become a professor of conducting.\\r\\nDoctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in conducting provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination and conducting audition are required. Students perform a number of conducted concerts, including a combination lecture-conducted concert with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework. Students must typically maintain a minimum B average. A DMA in conducting is a terminal degree, and as such, it qualifies the holder to teach in colleges, universities and conservatories. In addition to academic study, another part of the training pathway for many conductors is conducting amateur orchestras, such as youth orchestras, school orchestras and community orchestras.\\r\\nA small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting. These individuals often have achieved renown as an instrumental or vocal performer, and they have often undertaken a great deal of training in their area of expertise (instrumental performance or singing). Another way that a small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting is by learning on the job by conducting amateur orchestras, school orchestras, and community orchestras (or the equivalent choral ensembles).\\r\\nThe average salary of conductors in the US in 2014 was $48,180. A 3% growth rate is forecast for conducting jobs from 2014 to 2024, a slower than average growth rate.[14]","input":"What is the conductor of a choir called?"},{"output":"the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding","context":"An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist of wire wound into a coil. A current through the wire creates a magnetic field which is concentrated in the hole in the center of the coil. The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet.\\r\\nThe main advantage of an electromagnet over a permanent magnet is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding. However, unlike a permanent magnet that needs no power, an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field.\\r\\nElectromagnets are widely used as components of other electrical devices, such as motors, generators, electromechanical solenoids, relays, loudspeakers, hard disks, MRI machines, scientific instruments, and magnetic separation equipment. Electromagnets are also employed in industry for picking up and moving heavy iron objects such as scrap iron and steel.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDanish scientist Hans Christian ?rsted discovered in 1820 that electric currents create magnetic fields. British scientist William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet in 1824.[3][4] His first electromagnet was a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron that was wrapped with about 18 turns of bare copper wire (insulated wire didn't exist yet). The iron was varnished to insulate it from the windings. When a current was passed through the coil, the iron became magnetized and attracted other pieces of iron; when the current was stopped, it lost magnetization. Sturgeon displayed its power by showing that although it only weighed seven ounces (roughly 200 grams), it could lift nine pounds (roughly 4 kilos) when the current of a single-cell battery was applied. However, Sturgeon's magnets were weak because the uninsulated wire he used could only be wrapped in a single spaced out layer around the core, limiting the number of turns.\\r\\nBeginning in 1830, US scientist Joseph Henry systematically improved and popularized the electromagnet.[5][6] By using wire insulated by silk thread, and inspired by Schweigger's use of multiple turns of wire to make a galvanometer,[7] he was able to wind multiple layers of wire on cores, creating powerful magnets with thousands of turns of wire, including one that could support 2,063?lb (936?kg). The first major use for electromagnets was in telegraph sounders.\\r\\nThe magnetic domain theory of how ferromagnetic cores work was first proposed in 1906 by French physicist Pierre-Ernest Weiss, and the detailed modern quantum mechanical theory of ferromagnetism was worked out in the 1920s by Werner Heisenberg, Lev Landau, Felix Bloch and others.\\r\\nA portative electromagnet is one designed to just hold material in place; an example is a lifting magnet. A tractive electromagnet applies a force and moves something.[8]\\r\\nElectromagnets are very widely used in electric and electromechanical devices, including:\\r\\nA common tractive electromagnet is a uniformly-wound solenoid and plunger. The solenoid is a coil of wire, and the plunger is made of a material such as soft iron. Applying a current to the solenoid applies a force to the plunger and may make it move. The plunger stops moving when the forces upon it are balanced. For example, the forces are balanced when the plunger is centered in the solenoid.\\r\\nThe maximum uniform pull happens when one end of the plunger is at the middle of the solenoid. An approximation for the force F is[8]\\r\\nwhere C is a proportionality constant, A is the cross-sectional area of the plunger, n is the number of turns in the solenoid, I is the current through the solenoid wire, and l is the length of the solenoid. For units using inches, pounds force, and amperes with long, slender, solenoids, the value of C is around 0.009 to 0.010?psi (maximum pull pounds per square inch of plunger cross-sectional area).[9] For example, a 12-inch long coil (l=12 in) with a long plunger of 1-square inch cross section (A=1 in2) and 11,200 ampere-turns (n I=11,200 Aturn) had a maximum pull of 8.75 pounds (corresponding to C=0.0094 psi).[10]\\r\\nThe maximum pull is increased when a magnetic stop is inserted into the solenoid. The stop becomes a magnet that will attract the plunger; it adds little to the solenoid pull when the plunger is far away but dramatically increases the pull when they are close. An approximation for the pull P is[11]\\r\\nHere la is the distance between the end of the stop and the end of the plunger. The additional constant C1 for units of inches, pounds, and amperes with slender solenoids is about 2660. The second term within the bracket represents the same force as the stop-less solenoid above; the first term represents the attraction between the stop and the plunger.\\r\\nSome improvements can be made on the basic design. The ends of the stop and plunger are often conical. For example, the plunger may have a pointed end that fits into a matching recess in the stop. The shape makes the solenoid's pull more uniform as a function of separation. Another improvement is to add a magnetic return path around the outside of the solenoid (an \\"iron-clad solenoid\\").[12][13] The magnetic return path, just as the stop, has little impact until the air gap is small.\\r\\nAn electric current flowing in a wire creates a magnetic field around the wire, due to Ampere's law (see drawing below). To concentrate the magnetic field, in an electromagnet the wire is wound into a coil with many turns of wire lying side by side.[2] The magnetic field of all the turns of wire passes through the center of the coil, creating a strong magnetic field there.[2] A coil forming the shape of a straight tube (a helix) is called a solenoid.[1][2]\\r\\nThe direction of the magnetic field through a coil of wire can be found from a form of the right-hand rule.[14][15] If the fingers of the right hand are curled around the coil in the direction of current flow (conventional current, flow of positive charge) through the windings, the thumb points in the direction of the field inside the coil. The side of the magnet that the field lines emerge from is defined to be the north pole.\\r\\nMuch stronger magnetic fields can be produced if a \\"magnetic core\\" of a soft ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) material, such as iron, is placed inside the coil.[1][2][16][17] A core can increase the magnetic field to thousands of times the strength of the field of the coil alone, due to the high magnetic permeability  of the material.[1][2] This is called a ferromagnetic-core or iron-core electromagnet. However, not all electromagnets use cores, and the very strongest electromagnets, such as superconducting and the very high current electromagnets, cannot use them due to saturation.\\r\\nFor definitions of the variables below, see box at end of article.\\r\\nThe magnetic field of electromagnets in the general case is given by Ampere's Law:\\r\\nwhich says that the integral of the magnetizing field H around any closed loop of the field is equal to the sum of the current flowing through the loop. Another equation used, that gives the magnetic field due to each small segment of current, is the BiotÿSavart law. Computing the magnetic field and force exerted by ferromagnetic materials is difficult for two reasons. First, because the strength of the field varies from point to point in a complicated way, particularly outside the core and in air gaps, where fringing fields and leakage flux must be considered. Second, because the magnetic field B and force are nonlinear functions of the current, depending on the nonlinear relation between B and H for the particular core material used. For precise calculations, computer programs that can produce a model of the magnetic field using the finite element method are employed.\\r\\nThe material of a magnetic core (often made of iron or steel) is composed of small regions called magnetic domains that act like tiny magnets (see ferromagnetism). Before the current in the electromagnet is turned on, the domains in the iron core point in random directions, so their tiny magnetic fields cancel each other out, and the iron has no large-scale magnetic field. When a current is passed through the wire wrapped around the iron, its magnetic field penetrates the iron, and causes the domains to turn, aligning parallel to the magnetic field, so their tiny magnetic fields add to the wire's field, creating a large magnetic field that extends into the space around the magnet. The effect of the core is to concentrate the field, and the magnetic field passes through the core more easily than it would pass through air.\\r\\nThe larger the current passed through the wire coil, the more the domains align, and the stronger the magnetic field is. Finally, all the domains are lined up, and further increases in current only cause slight increases in the magnetic field: this phenomenon is called saturation.\\r\\nWhen the current in the coil is turned off, in the magnetically soft materials that are nearly always used as cores, most of the domains lose alignment and return to a random state and the field disappears. However, some of the alignment persists, because the domains have difficulty turning their direction of magnetization, leaving the core a weak permanent magnet. This phenomenon is called hysteresis and the remaining magnetic field is called remanent magnetism. The residual magnetization of the core can be removed by degaussing. In alternating current electromagnets, such as are used in motors, the core's magnetization is constantly reversed, and the remanence contributes to the motor's losses.\\r\\nIn many practical applications of electromagnets, such as motors, generators, transformers, lifting magnets, and loudspeakers, the iron core is in the form of a loop or magnetic circuit, possibly broken by a few narrow air gaps.[2] This is because the magnetic field lines are in the form of closed loops. Iron presents much less \\"resistance\\" (reluctance) to the magnetic field than air, so a stronger field can be obtained if most of the magnetic field's path is within the core.[2]\\r\\nSince most of the magnetic field is confined within the outlines of the core loop, this allows a simplification of the mathematical analysis.[2] See the drawing at right. A common simplifying assumption satisfied by many electromagnets, which will be used in this section, is that the magnetic field strength B is constant around the magnetic circuit (within the core and air gaps) and zero outside it. Most of the magnetic field will be concentrated in the core material (C). Within the core the magnetic field (B) will be approximately uniform across any cross section, so if in addition the core has roughly constant area throughout its length, the field in the core will be constant.[2] This just leaves the air gaps (G), if any, between core sections. In the gaps the magnetic field lines are no longer confined by the core, so they 'bulge' out beyond the outlines of the core before curving back to enter the next piece of core material, reducing the field strength in the gap.[2] The bulges (BF) are called fringing fields.[2] However, as long as the length of the gap is smaller than the cross section dimensions of the core, the field in the gap will be approximately the same as in the core. In addition, some of the magnetic field lines (BL) will take 'short cuts' and not pass through the entire core circuit, and thus will not contribute to the force exerted by the magnet. This also includes field lines that encircle the wire windings but do not enter the core. This is called leakage flux. Therefore, the equations in this section are valid for electromagnets for which:\\r\\nThe main nonlinear feature of ferromagnetic materials is that the B field saturates at a certain value,[2] which is around 1.6 to 2 teslas (T) for most high permeability core steels.[18][19][20] The B field increases quickly with increasing current up to that value, but above that value the field levels off and becomes almost constant, regardless of how much current is sent through the windings.[2] So the maximum strength of the magnetic field possible from an iron core electromagnet is limited to around 1.6 to 2 T.[18][20]\\r\\nThe magnetic field created by an electromagnet is proportional to both the number of turns in the winding, N, and the current in the wire, I, hence this product, NI, in ampere-turns, is given the name magnetomotive force. For an electromagnet with a single magnetic circuit, of which length Lcore of the magnetic field path is in the core material and length Lgap is in air gaps, Ampere's Law reduces to:[2][21][22]\\r\\nThis is a nonlinear equation, because the permeability of the core, , varies with the magnetic field B. For an exact solution, the value of  at the B value used must be obtained from the core material hysteresis curve.[2] If B is unknown, the equation must be solved by numerical methods. However, if the magnetomotive force is well above saturation, so the core material is in saturation, the magnetic field will be approximately the saturation value Bsat for the material, and won't vary much with changes in NI. For a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap) most core materials saturate at a magnetomotive force of roughly 800 ampere-turns per meter of flux path.\\r\\nFor most core materials, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2000\\r\\n?\\r\\n6000\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mu _{r}=\\\\mu /\\\\mu _{0}\\\\approx 2000-6000\\\\,}\\r\\n\\r\\n.[22] So in equation (1) above, the second term dominates. Therefore, in magnetic circuits with an air gap, the strength of the magnetic field B depends strongly on the length of the air gap, and the length of the flux path in the core doesn't matter much. Given an air gap of 1mm, a magnetomotive force of about 796 Ampere-turns is required to produce a magnetic field of 1T.\\r\\nThe force exerted by an electromagnet on a section of core material is:\\r\\nThe force equation can be derived from the energy stored in a magnetic field. Energy is force times distance. Rearranging terms yields the equation above.\\r\\nThe 1.6 T limit on the field[18][20] mentioned above sets a limit on the maximum force per unit core area, or pressure, an iron-core electromagnet can exert; roughly:\\r\\nIn more intuitive units it's useful to remember that at 1T the magnetic pressure is approximately 4 atmospheres, or kg/cm2.\\r\\nGiven a core geometry, the B field needed for a given force can be calculated from (2); if it comes out to much more than 1.6 T, a larger core must be used.\\r\\nFor a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap), such as would be found in an electromagnet lifting a piece of iron bridged across its poles, equation (1) becomes:\\r\\nSubstituting into (2), the force is:\\r\\nIt can be seen that to maximize the force, a core with a short flux path L and a wide cross-sectional area A is preferred (this also applies to magnets with an air gap). To achieve this, in applications like lifting magnets (see photo above) and loudspeakers a flat cylindrical design is often used. The winding is wrapped around a short wide cylindrical core that forms one pole, and a thick metal housing that wraps around the outside of the windings forms the other part of the magnetic circuit, bringing the magnetic field to the front to form the other pole.\\r\\nThe above methods are applicable to electromagnets with a magnetic circuit and do not apply when a large part of the magnetic field path is outside the core. An example would be a magnet with a straight cylindrical core like the one shown at the top of this article. For electromagnets (or permanent magnets) with well defined 'poles' where the field lines emerge from the core, the force between two electromagnets can be found using the 'Gilbert model' which assumes the magnetic field is produced by fictitious 'magnetic charges' on the surface of the poles, with pole strength m and units of Ampere-turn meter. Magnetic pole strength of electromagnets can be found from:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nN\\r\\nI\\r\\nA\\r\\n\\r\\nL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle m={\\\\frac {NIA}{L}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe force between two poles is:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nF\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle F={\\\\frac {\\\\mu _{0}m_{1}m_{2}}{4\\\\pi r^{2}}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis model doesn't give the correct magnetic field inside the core and thus gives incorrect results if the pole of one magnet gets too close to another magnet.\\r\\nThere are several side effects which occur in electromagnets which must be provided for in their design. These generally become more significant in larger electromagnets.\\r\\nThe only power consumed in a stationary DC electromagnet that is under constant current and beyond the influence of other EM fields is due to the resistance of the windings, and is dissipated as heat. Some large electromagnets require cooling water circulating through pipes in the windings to carry off the waste heat.\\r\\nSince the magnetic field is proportional to the product NI, the number of turns in the windings N and the current I can be chosen to minimize heat losses, as long as their product is constant. Since the power dissipation, P = I2R, increases with the square of the current but only increases approximately linearly with the number of windings, the power lost in the windings can be minimized by reducing I and increasing the number of turns N proportionally, or using thicker wire to reduce the resistance. For example, halving I and doubling N halves the power loss, as does doubling the area of the wire. In either case, increasing the amount of wire reduces the ohmic losses. For this reason, electromagnets often have a significant thickness of windings.\\r\\nHowever, the limit to increasing N or lowering the resistance is that the windings take up more room between the magnet's core pieces. If the area available for the windings is filled up, more turns require going to a smaller diameter of wire, which has higher resistance, which cancels the advantage of using more turns. So in large magnets there is a minimum amount of heat loss that can't be reduced. This increases with the square of the magnetic flux B2.\\r\\nAn electromagnet has significant inductance, and resists changes in the current through its windings. Any sudden changes in the winding current cause large voltage spikes across the windings. This is because when the current through the magnet is increased, such as when it is turned on, energy from the circuit must be stored in the magnetic field. When it is turned off the energy in the field is returned to the circuit.\\r\\nIf an ordinary switch is used to control the winding current, this can cause sparks at the terminals of the switch. This doesn't occur when the magnet is switched on, because the limited supply voltage causes the current through the magnet and the field energy to increase slowly, but when it is switched off, the energy in the magnetic field is suddenly returned to the circuit, causing a large voltage spike and an arc across the switch contacts, which can damage them. With small electromagnets a capacitor is sometimes used across the contacts, which reduces arcing by temporarily storing the current. More often a diode is used to prevent voltage spikes by providing a path for the current to recirculate through the winding until the energy is dissipated as heat. The diode is connected across the winding, oriented so it is reverse-biased during steady state operation and doesn't conduct. When the supply voltage is removed, the voltage spike forward-biases the diode and the reactive current continues to flow through the winding, through the diode and back into the winding. A diode used in this way is called a freewheeling diode or flyback diode.\\r\\nLarge electromagnets are usually powered by variable current electronic power supplies, controlled by a microprocessor, which prevent voltage spikes by accomplishing current changes slowly, in gentle ramps. It may take several minutes to energize or deenergize a large magnet.\\r\\nIn powerful electromagnets, the magnetic field exerts a force on each turn of the windings, due to the Lorentz force \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nq\\r\\n\\r\\nv\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle q\\\\mathbf {v} \\\\times \\\\mathbf {B} \\\\,}\\r\\n\\r\\n acting on the moving charges within the wire. The Lorentz force is perpendicular to both the axis of the wire and the magnetic field. It can be visualized as a pressure between the magnetic field lines, pushing them apart. It has two effects on an electromagnet's windings:\\r\\nThe Lorentz forces increase with B2. In large electromagnets the windings must be firmly clamped in place, to prevent motion on power-up and power-down from causing metal fatigue in the windings. In the Bitter design, below, used in very high field research magnets, the windings are constructed as flat disks to resist the radial forces, and clamped in an axial direction to resist the axial ones.\\r\\nIn alternating current (AC) electromagnets, used in transformers, inductors, and AC motors and generators, the magnetic field is constantly changing. This causes energy losses in their magnetic cores that is dissipated as heat in the core. The losses stem from two processes:\\r\\nThe energy loss per cycle of the AC current is constant for each of these processes, so the power loss increases linearly with frequency.\\r\\nWhen a magnetic field higher than the ferromagnetic limit of 1.6 T is needed, superconducting electromagnets can be used. Instead of using ferromagnetic materials, these use superconducting windings cooled with liquid helium, which conduct current without electrical resistance. These allow enormous currents to flow, which generate intense magnetic fields. Superconducting magnets are limited by the field strength at which the winding material ceases to be superconducting. Current designs are limited to 10ÿ20 T, with the current (2009) record of 33.8 T.[23] The necessary refrigeration equipment and cryostat make them much more expensive than ordinary electromagnets. However, in high power applications this can be offset by lower operating costs, since after startup no power is required for the windings, since no energy is lost to ohmic heating. They are used in particle accelerators and MRI machines.\\r\\nBoth iron-core and superconducting electromagnets have limits to the field they can produce. Therefore, the most powerful man-made magnetic fields have been generated by air-core nonsuperconducting electromagnets of a design invented by Francis Bitter in 1933, called Bitter electromagnets.[24] Instead of wire windings, a Bitter magnet consists of a solenoid made of a stack of conducting disks, arranged so that the current moves in a helical path through them, with a hole through the center where the maximum field is created. This design has the mechanical strength to withstand the extreme Lorentz forces of the field, which increase with B2. The disks are pierced with holes through which cooling water passes to carry away the heat caused by the high current. The strongest continuous field achieved solely with a resistive magnet is 37.5 T as of 31?March?2014[update], produced by a Bitter electromagnet at the Radboud University High Field Magnet Laboratory in Nijmegen, Holland.[25] The previous record was 35 T.[23] The strongest continuous magnetic field overall, 45 T,[24] was achieved in June 2000 with a hybrid device consisting of a Bitter magnet inside a superconducting magnet.\\r\\nThe factor limiting the strength of electromagnets is the inability to dissipate the enormous waste heat, so more powerful fields, up to 100 T,[23] have been obtained from resistive magnets by sending brief pulses of high current through them; the inactive period after each pulse allows the heat produced during the pulse to be removed, before the next pulse. The most powerful manmade magnetic fields[26] have been created by using explosives to compress the magnetic field inside an electromagnet as it is pulsed; these are called explosively pumped flux compression generators. The implosion compresses the magnetic field to values of around 1000 T[24] for a few microseconds. While this method may seem very destructive, it is possible to redirect the brunt of the blast radially outwards so that neither the experiment nor the magnetic structure are harmed. These devices are known as destructive pulsed electromagnets.[27] They are used in physics and materials science research to study the properties of materials at high magnetic fields.","input":"What advantage does an electromagnet have over a permanent magnet?"},{"output":"seven","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Super Bowl is the annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL). The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand,[1] usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums.[2] Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in four such contests.

The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances: 1972ÿ1974. The Denver Broncos (3ÿ5) and Patriots have each lost a record five Super Bowls. The Minnesota Vikings (0ÿ4) and the Bills have lost four. The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises: the Green Bay Packers (1966ÿ1967), the Miami Dolphins (1972ÿ1973), the Pittsburgh Steelers (1974ÿ1975 and 1978ÿ1979, the only team to accomplish this feat twice), the San Francisco 49ers (1988ÿ1989), the Dallas Cowboys (1992ÿ1993), the Denver Broncos (1997ÿ1998), and the New England Patriots (2003ÿ2004).

The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens, who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position. Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl, including franchise relocations and renaming: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1964) and Lions (1957) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumbers in parentheses in the table are Super Bowl appearances as of the date of that Super Bowl and are used as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven franchises have won consecutive Super Bowls, one of which (Pittsburgh) has accomplished it twice:\\r\\n\\r\\nNo franchise has yet won three Super Bowls in a row, although several have come close:\\r\\n\\r\\nThree franchises have lost consecutive Super Bowls:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the sortable table below, teams are ordered first by number of appearances, then by number of wins, and finally by number of years since last appearing in a Super Bowl.

For a complex multicellular eukaryote, A. thaliana has a relatively small genome of approximately 135 megabase pairs (Mbp).[8] It was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, and is a popular tool for understanding the molecular biology of many plant traits, including flower development and light sensing.\\r\\n\\r\\nArabidopsis thaliana is an annual (rarely biennial) plant, usually growing to 20ÿ25?cm tall.[6] The leaves form a rosette at the base of the plant, with a few leaves also on the flowering stem. The basal leaves are green to slightly purplish in color, 1.5ÿ5?cm long and 2ÿ10?mm broad, with an entire to coarsely serrated margin; the stem leaves are smaller and unstalked, usually with an entire margin. Leaves are covered with small, unicellular hairs (called trichomes). The flowers are 3?mm in diameter, arranged in a corymb; their structure is that of the typical Brassicaceae. The fruit is a siliqua 5ÿ20?mm long, containing 20ÿ30 seeds.[9][10][11][12] Roots are simple in structure, with a single primary root that grows vertically downward, later producing smaller lateral roots. These roots form interactions with rhizosphere bacteria such as Bacillus megaterium.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nA. thaliana can complete its entire lifecycle in six weeks. The central stem that produces flowers grows after about three weeks, and the flowers naturally self-pollinate. In the lab, A. thaliana may be grown in Petri plates, pots, or hydroponics, under fluorescent lights or in a greenhouse.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plant was first described in 1577 in the Harz Mountains by Johannes Thal?(de) (1542ÿ1583), a physician from Nordhausen, Thringen, Germany, who called it Pilosella siliquosa. In 1753, Carl Linnaeus renamed the plant Arabis thaliana in honor of Thal.  In 1842, the German botanist Gustav Heynhold erected the new genus Arabidopsis and placed the plant in that genus. The genus name, Arabidopsis, comes from Greek, meaning \\"resembling Arabis\\" (the genus in which Linnaeus had initially placed it).\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of natural inbred accessions of A. thaliana have been collected from throughout its natural and introduced range.[15] These accessions exhibit considerable genetic and phenotypic variation which can be used to study the adaptation of this species to different environments.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nA. thaliana is native to Europe, Asia, Africa. It also appears to be native in tropical afroalpine ecosystems.[16] It has been introduced and naturalized worldwide.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nA. thaliana readily grows and often pioneers rocky, sandy and calcareous soils. It is generally considered a weed, due to its widespread distribution in agricultural fields, roadside, railway lines, waste ground and other disturbed habitat.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most Brassicaceae species, A. thaliana is edible by humans as a salad or cooked, but it does not enjoy a widespread use as a spring vegetable.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nBotanists and biologists began to research A. thaliana in the early 1900s, and the first systematic description of mutants was done around 1945.[19] A. thaliana is now widely used for studying plant sciences, including genetics, evolution, population genetics, and plant development.[20][21][22] Although A. thaliana has little direct significance for agriculture, it has several traits that make it a useful model for understanding the genetic, cellular, and molecular biology of flowering plants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first mutant in A. thaliana was documented in 1873 by Alexander Braun, describing a double flower phenotype (the mutated gene was likely Agamous, cloned and characterized in 1990).[23] However, not until 1943 did Friedrich Laibach (who had published the chromosome number in 1907) propose A. thaliana as a model organism.[24] His student, Erna Reinholz, published her thesis on A. thaliana in 1945, describing the first collection of A. thaliana mutants that they generated using X-ray mutagenesis. Laibach continued his important contributions to A. thaliana research by collecting a large number of accessions (often questionably referred to as 'ecotypes'). With the help of Albert Kranz, these were organised into a large collection of 750 natural accessions of A. thaliana from around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1950s and 1960s,  John Langridge and George Rdei played an important role in establishing A. thaliana as a useful organism for biological laboratory experiments. Rdei wrote several scholarly reviews instrumental in introducing the model to the scientific community. The start of the A. thaliana research community dates to a newsletter called Arabidopsis Information Service (AIS), established in 1964. The first International Arabidopsis Conference was held in 1965, in G?ttingen, Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, A. thaliana started to become widely used in plant research laboratories around the world. It was one of several candidates that included maize, petunia, and tobacco.[24] The latter two were attractive, since they were easily transformable with the then-current technologies, while maize was a well-established genetic model for plant biology. 1986 was a breakthrough year for A. thaliana as a model plant, in which T-DNA-mediated transformation and the first cloned A. thaliana gene were described.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe small size of its genome, and the fact that it is diploid, makes Arabidopsis thaliana useful for genetic mapping and sequencing  with about 135 mega base pairs[27] and five chromosomes, A. thaliana has one of the smallest genomes among plants.[8] It was long thought to have the smallest genome of all flowering plants,[28] but that title is now considered to belong to plants in the genus Genlisea, order Lamiales, with Genlisea tuberosa, a carnivorous plant, showing a genome size of approximately 61?Mbp.[29] It was the first plant genome to be sequenced, completed in 2000 by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative.[30] The most up-to-date version of the A. thaliana genome is maintained by the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR).[31] Much work has been done to assign functions to its 27,000 genes and the 35,000 proteins they encode.[32] Post-genomic research, such as metabolomics, has also provided useful insights to the metabolism of this species and how environmental perturbations [33] can affect metabolic processes.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrichome formation is initiated by the GLABROUS1 protein. Knockouts of the corresponding gene lead to glabrous plants. This phenotype has already been used in gene editing experiments and might be of interest as visual marker for plant research to improve gene editing methods such as CRISPR/Cas9.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetic transformation of A. thaliana is routine, utilizing Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transfer DNA into the plant genome. The current protocol, termed \\"floral dip\\", involves simply dipping flowers into a solution containing Agrobacterium carrying a plasmid of interest and a detergent.[37][38] This method avoids the need for tissue culture or plant regeneration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A. thaliana gene knockout collections are a unique resource for plant biology made possible by the availability of high-throughput transformation and funding for genomics resources.  The site of T-DNA insertions has been determined for over 300,000 independent transgenic lines, with the information and seeds accessible through online T-DNA databases.  Through these collections, insertional mutants are available for most genes in A. thaliana.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacterized accessions and mutant lines of A. thaliana serve as experimental material in laboratory studies. The most commonly used background lines are Ler (Landsberg erecta), and Col, or Columbia.[39] Other background lines less-often cited in the scientific literature are Ws, or Wassilewskija, C24, Cvi, or Cape Verde Islands, Nossen, etc. (see for ex.[40]) Sets of closely related accessions named Col-0, Col-1, etc., have been obtained and characterized; in general, mutant lines are available through stock centers, of which best-known are the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center-NASC[39] and the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center-ABRC in Ohio, USA.[41]\\r\\nThe Col-0 accession was selected by Rdei from within a (nonirradiated) population of seeds designated 'Landsberg' which he received from Laibach.[42] Columbia (named for the location of Rdei's former institution, the University of Missouri-Columbia) was the reference accession sequenced in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative. The Ler (Landsberg erecta) line was selected by Rdei (because of its short stature) from a Landsberg population he had mutagenized with X-rays. As the Ler collection of mutants is derived from this initial line, Ler-0 does not correspond to the Landsberg accessions, which designated La-0, La-1, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, scientists at Purdue University proposed that A. thaliana possessed an alternative to previously known mechanisms of DNA repair, producing an unusual pattern of inheritance. However, the phenomenon observed (reversion of mutant copies of the HOTHEAD gene to a wild-type state) was later suggested to be an artifact because the mutants show increased outcrossing due to organ fusion.[43][44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plant's small size and rapid lifecycle are also advantageous for research. Having specialized as a spring ephemeral, it has been used to found several laboratory strains that take about six weeks from germination to mature seed. The small size of the plant is convenient for cultivation in a small space, and it produces many seeds. Further, the selfing nature of this plant assists genetic experiments. Also, as an individual plant can produce several thousand seeds; each of the above criteria leads to A. thaliana being valued as a genetic model organism.\\r\\n\\r\\nA. thaliana has been extensively studied as a model for flower development. The developing flower has four basic organs: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels (which go on to form pistils). These organs are arranged in a series of whorls: four sepals on the outer whorl, followed by four petals inside this, six stamens, and a central carpel region. Homeotic mutations in A. thaliana result in the change of one organ to another  in the case of the agamous mutation, for example, stamens become petals and carpels are replaced with a new flower, resulting in a recursively repeated sepal-petal-petal pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\nObservations of homeotic mutations led to the formulation of the ABC model of flower development by E. Coen and E. Meyerowitz.[46] According to this model, floral organ identity genes are divided into three classes: class A genes (which affect sepals and petals), class B genes (which affect petals and stamens), and class C genes (which affect stamens and carpels). These genes code for transcription factors that combine to cause tissue specification in their respective regions during development. Although developed through study of A. thaliana flowers, this model is generally applicable to other flowering plants.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies of A. thaliana have provided considerable insights with regards to the genetics of leaf morphogenesis, particularly in dicotyledon-type plants.[47][48] Much of the understanding has come from analyzing mutants in leaf development, some of which were identified in the 1960s, but were not analysed with genetic and molecular techniques until the mid-1990s. A. thaliana leaves are well suited to studies of leaf development because they are relatively simple and stable.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing A. thaliana, the genetics behind leaf shape development have become more clear and have been broken down into three stages: The initiation of the leaf primordium, the establishment of dorsiventrality, and the development of a marginal meristem. Leaf primordia are initiated by the suppression of the genes and proteins of the class I KNOX family (such as SHOOT APICAL MERISTEMLESS). These class I KNOX proteins directly suppress gibberellin biosynthesis in the leaf primordium. Many genetic factors were found to be involved in the suppression of these class I KNOX genes in leaf primordia (such as ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1, BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1, SAWTOOTH1, etc.). Thus, with this suppression, the levels of gibberellin increase and leaf primordium initiates growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe establishment of leaf dorsiventrality is important since the dorsal (adaxial) surface of the leaf is different from the ventral (abaxial) surface.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nA. thaliana is well suited for light microscopy analysis. Young seedlings on the whole, and their roots in particular, are relatively translucent. This, together with their small size, facilitates live cell imaging using both fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy.[50] By wet-mounting seedlings in water or in culture media, plants may be imaged uninvasively, obviating the need for fixation and sectioning and allowing time-lapse measurements.[51] Fluorescent protein constructs can be introduced through transformation. The developmental stage of each cell can be inferred from its location in the plant or by using fluorescent protein markers, allowing detailed developmental analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photoreceptors phytochromes A, B, C, D, and E mediate red light-based phototropic response. Understanding the function of these receptors has helped plant biologists understand the signalling cascades that regulate photoperiodism, germination, de-etiolation, and shade avoidance in plants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UVR8 protein detects UV-B light and mediates response to this DNA damaging wavelength.\\r\\n\\r\\nA. thaliana was used extensively in the study of the genetic basis of phototropism, chloroplast alignment, and stomatal aperture and other blue light-influenced processes.[52] These traits respond to blue light, which is perceived by the phototropin light receptors. Arabidopsis has also been important in understanding the functions of another blue light receptor, cryptochrome, which is especially important for light entrainment to control the plants' circadian rhythms.[53] When the onset of darkness is unusually early, A. thaliana reduces its metabolism of starch by an amount that effectively requires division.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nLight responses were even found in roots, previously thought to be largely insensitive to light. While the gravitropic response of A. thaliana root organs is their predominant tropic response, specimens treated with mutagens and selected for the absence of gravitropic action showed negative phototropic response to blue or white light, and positive response to red light, indicating that the roots also show positive phototropism.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, Dr. Janet Braam of Rice University genetically engineered A. thaliana to glow in the dark when touched.  The effect was visible to ultrasensitive cameras.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple efforts, including the Glowing Plant project, have sought to use A. thaliana to increase plant luminescence intensity towards commercially viable levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to understand how plants achieve resistance to protect the world's food production, as well as the agriculture industry.  Many model systems have been developed to better understand interactions between plants and bacterial, fungal, oomycete, viral, and nematode pathogens.  Arabidopsis thaliana has been a powerful tool for the study of the subdicipline of  plant pathology, that is, the interaction between plants and disease-causing pathogens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of A. thaliana has led to many breakthroughs in the advancement of knowledge of how plants manifest plant disease resistance.  The reason most plants are resistant to most pathogens is through nonhost resistance. This is, not all pathogens will infect all plants.  An example where A. thaliana was used to determine the genes responsible for nonhost resistance is Blumeria graminis, the causal agent of powdery mildew of grasses.  A. thaliana mutants were developed using the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate and screened to identify mutants with increased infection by B. graminis.[57][58][59]  The mutants with higher infection rates are referred to as PEN mutants due to the ability of B. graminis to penetrate A. thaliana to begin the disease process.  The PEN genes were later mapped to identify the genes responsible for nonhost resistance to B. graminis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, when a plant is exposed to a pathogen, or nonpathogenic microbe, there is an initial response, known as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI), because the plant detects conserved motifs known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).[60] These PAMPs are detected by specialized receptors in the host known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the plant cell surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best-characterized PRR in A. thaliana is FLS2 (Flagellin-Sensing2), which recognizes bacterial flagellin,[61][62] a specialized organelle used by microorganisms for the purpose of motility, as well as the ligand flg22, which comprises the 22 amino acids recognized by FLS2.  Discovery of FLS2 was facilitated by the identification of an A. thaliana ecotype, Ws-0, that was unable to detect flg22, leading to the identification of the gene encoding FLS2.  FLS2 shows striking similarity to rice XA21, the first PRR isolated in 1995\\r\\n\\r\\nA second PRR, EF-Tu receptor (EFR), identified in A. thaliana, recognizes the bacterial EF-Tu protein, the prokaryotic elongation factor used in protein synthesis, as well as the laboratory-used  ligand elf18.[63]  Using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, a technique that takes advantage of the natural process by which Agrobacterium transfers genes into host plants, the EFR gene was transformed into Nicotiana benthamiana, tobacco plant that does not recognize EF-Tu, thereby permitting recognition of bacterial EF-Tu[64] thereby confirming EFR as the receptor of EF-Tu.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth FLS2 and EFR use similar signal transduction pathways to initiate PTI.  A. thaliana has been instrumental in dissecting these pathways to better understand the regulation of immune responses, the most notable one being the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) cascade.  Downstream responses of PTI include callose deposition, the oxidative burst, and transcription of defense-related genes.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nPTI is able to combat pathogens in a nonspecific manner.  A stronger and more specific response in plants is that of effector-triggered immunity (ETI).  ETI is dependent upon the recognition of pathogen effectors, proteins secreted by the pathogen that alter functions in the host,  by plant resistance genes (R-genes), often described as a gene-for-gene relationship.  This recognition may occur directly or indirectly via a guardee protein in a hypothesis known as the guard hypothesis.  The first R-gene cloned in A. thaliana was RPS2 (resistance to Pseudomonas syringe 2), which is responsible for recognition of the effector avrRpt2.[66]  The bacterial effector avrRpt2 is delivered into A. thaliana via the Type III secretion system of P. syringae pv tomato strain DC3000.  Recognition of avrRpt2 by RPS2 occurs via the guardee protein RIN4, which is cleaved .  Recognition of a pathogen effector leads to a dramatic immune response known as the hypersensitive response, in which the infected plant cells undergo cell death to prevent the spread of the pathogen.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nSystemic acquired resistance (SAR) is another example of resistance that is better understood in plants because of research done in A. thaliana.  Benzothiadiazol (BTH), a salicylic acid (SA) analog, has been used historically as an antifungal compound in crop plants.  BTH, as well as SA, has been shown to induce SAR in plants.  The initiation of the SAR pathway was first demonstrated in A. thaliana in which increased SA levels are recognized by nonexpresser of PR genes 1 (NPR1)[68]  due to redox change in the cytosol, resulting in the reduction of NPR1.  NPR1, which usually exists in a multiplex (oligomeric) state, becomes monomeric (a single unit) upon reduction.[69]  When NPR1 becomes monomeric, it translocates to the nucleus, were it interacts with many TGA transcription factors, and is able to induce pathogen-related genes such as PR1.[70] Another example of SAR would be the research done with transgenic tobacco plants, which express bacterial salicylate hydroxylase, nahG gene, requires the accumulation of SA for its expression [71]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlants are affected by multiple pathogens throughout their lifetime. In response to the presence of pathogens, plants have evolved receptors on the cell surface to detect and respond to pathogens.[72] Arabidopsis Thaliana is a model organism used to determine specific defense mechanisms of plant-pathogen resistance.[73] These plants have special receptors on their cell surfaces that allow for detection of pathogens and initiate mechanisms to inhibit pathogen growth.[73] They contain two receptors, FLS2 (bacterial flagellin receptor) and EF-Tu (bacterial EF-Tu protein), which use signal transduction pathways to initiate the disease response pathway.[73] The pathway leads to the recognition of the pathogen causing the infected cells to undergo cell death to stop the spread of the pathogen.[73] Plants with FLS2 and EF-Tu receptors have shown to have increased fitness in the population.[71] This has led to the belief that plant-pathogen resistance is an evolutionary mechanism that has built up over generations to respond to dynamic environments, such as increased predation and extreme temperatures.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nA. thaliana has also been used to study systemic acquired resistance (SAR).[74]\\r\\nThis pathway utilizes Benzothiadiazol, a chemical inducer, to induce transcription factors, mRNA, of SAR genes. This accumulation of transcription factors leads to inhibition of pathogen-related genes.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlant-pathogen interactions are important for understanding of how plants have evolved to combat different types of pathogens that may affect them.[71]  Variation in resistance of plants across populations is due to variation in environmental factors. Plants that have evolved resistance, whether it be the general variation or the SAR variation, have been able to live longer and hold off necrosis of their tissue (premature death of cells), which leads to better adaptation and fitness for populations that are in rapidly changing environments.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nOngoing research on Arabidopsis thaliana is being performed on the International Space Station by the European Space Agency.

However, these meioses can provide the adaptive benefit of recombinational repair of DNA damages during formation of germ cells at each generation.[80]  Such a benefit may have been sufficient to allow the long-term persistence of meioses even when followed by self-fertilization. A physical mechanism for self-pollination in A. thaliana is through pre-anthesis autogamy, such that fertilisation takes place largely before flower opening.","input":"Why is arabidopsis thaliana a good research tool?"},{"output":"At the Algiers Motel, approximately one mile east of where the riots began, three teenage civilians, all of them black, were beaten and killed by police.","context":"The Algiers Motel Incident occurred in Detroit, Michigan, United States, during the night of July 25ÿ26, 1967 during the racially charged 12th Street Riot. At the Algiers Motel, approximately one mile east of where the riots began, three teenage civilians, all of them black, were beaten and killed by police. Nine otherstwo white females and seven black maleswere badly beaten and humiliated by members of a riot task force composed of the Detroit Police Department, the Michigan State Police, and the Michigan Army National Guard, and a private security guard. The incident occurred after reports were received that snipers, a gunman, or group of gunmen had been seen at or near the motel.[1] One death has never been explained as the body was allegedly found by responding officers. Two deaths have been attributed to \\"justifiable homicide\\" or \\"self-defense\\". Charges of felonious assault, conspiracy, murder, and conspiracy to commit civil rights abuse were filed against three officers and one private security guard. All were found not guilty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 12th Street Riot began in the early morning hours of Sunday, July 23, 1967. The Detroit police department at the time was 93% white,[2][3] of whom 45% working in black neighborhoods were considered to be \\"extremely anti-Negro\\" and an additional 34% were \\"prejudiced\\".[4] The riot began after police raided a black-owned business that hosted a \\"blind pig\\" or illegal bar, during a party to celebrate the safe return of two black Vietnam War veterans.[5] Police had expected a small number of patrons; however, there were 85 or more patrons inside. As the dozens of patrons at the party were being loaded into police vans, a mob of people formed around the vans. One of the sons of the blind pig's owner jumped on the roof of a car and threw a bottle at the police, thus starting the riot, and the mob began throwing rocks and bottles at the police.[5] Numerous businesses were looted or burnt down as the riot spread to other districts of Detroit. At first, police officers were ordered to hold back from responding to the rioting, to prevent an escalation in violence.[6] A curfew was imposed and many people in Detroit stayed home or took shelter. Firefighters were held back from the fires by looters throwing objects at them or by snipers. National Guardsmen were activated by the Michigan government and were patrolling the streets and guarding several large businesses. State Troopers and US Army personnel would also be activated to quell the rioting.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Algiers Motel at 8301 Woodward Avenue[7] near the Virginia Park district of Detroit was a black-owned business, owned by Sam Gant and McUrant Pye. It was one of three motels in Detroit owned by Gant and Pye, the others being the Alamo, at Alfred and Woodward, and the Rio Grande, on West Grand near Grand River.[8] Prior to Gant and Pye's purchase in 1965, the motel's white owner had barred black people from staying at the motel.[9] The Algiers was known to police as a center of drugs and prostitution and was raided regularly by the vice squad. It was located close to the then-headquarters of General Motors (GM) and executives of the firm were regular customers.[9] To the rear of the motel, a three-story detached home, known as the Manor House or Annex, was also rented to clients. Its street address was 50 Virginia Park Street,[7] and it was accessible from Virginia Park and through a driveway from Woodward. The motel itself was laid out in the shape of a \\"U\\", with its office, pool and cabana rooms to the left and a two-story wing of rooms to the right around its parking lot.[10] The Manor House could be seen from Woodward Avenue.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the riot started, The Dramatics left a concert on Saturday July 22 and all checked in at the Algiers. They stayed until Tuesday July 25, when the motel was raided.[11] Three of the members: Ronald Banks, Larry Demps and Michael Calhoun, left, leaving Roderick Davis, Larry Reed and the band's valet Fred Temple at the Motel.[12] In the evening of July 25, the Motel Annex was occupied by several people who had taken refuge from the rioting:[13]\\r\\nOn July 25, 1967, officers and guardsmen were guarding the Great Lakes Mutual Life Insurance building one block north.[14] Security guard Melvin Dismukes was guarding a store across the street from the Algiers. After midnight, shots were heard and Guardsmen Ted Thomas reported shots fired in the vicinity of the Algiers Motel.[15] A large contingent of Detroit police officers, State Troopers, and Guardsmen were ordered to investigate the scene. People were observed in the windows of the Algiers' annex building. The law enforcement personnel then shot out the windows of the Algiers' annex and entered the building through its three entrances.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to testimony, black youths Cooper, Clark, and Forsythe, and two white females, Hysell and Malloy, were listening to music in a third-floor room of the annex. 17-year-old Cooper pulled out a starter pistol and shot blanks in the air. Following the starter pistol shots, one of the Algiers Motel windows was shot at and shatteredfrom the outside. Alarmed and frightened, the occupants fled to other rooms as law enforcement personnel rushed into the annex.[16]\\r\\nThe first youth killed, Carl Cooper, may have been killed when law enforcement personnel first entered the building and according to later testimony, may have been mistaken for an armed rioter in the confusion. Several of the law enforcement witnesses later testified that Cooper was already dead when they entered the building. Cooper had been in a third-floor room but was found dead in the A-2 first-floor room. The death was never fully explained and no-one was ever arrested for Cooper's death.[17] His injuries were consistent with buckshot wounds from the type of shotguns the Detroit Police Department used at that time.[18] In their testimony about the entering of the annex, Guardsmen, State Troopers and Detroit police officers all testified they were not the first to enter, stating that Cooper was already dead when they arrived, leaving responsibility for the death unexplained. In the federal conspiracy trial, the defense would attempt to show that Cooper was killed by occupants of the motel before the police arrived, but this was denied by two of the motel's occupants. The occupants testified that at least one policeman shot in to the rooms first, and checked for persons later.[19]\\r\\nThe occupants of the motel's annex were then rounded up in the first-floor hallway and lined up against the wall. The various officers present hit each of the persons in turn, threatening to kill them unless they told the officers who had the gun and was sniping from the motel.[20] The two 18-year-old women, Juli Hysell and Karen Malloy, were both forcibly stripped naked and each harangued as \\"nigger lovers.\\"[21] Several of the men were shown a knife on the floor and told to pick it up, so they could be killed. In turn, each of the black youths in line was taken into rooms and intimidated with threats or gunshots and told to stay still and quiet or be killed.[21] The policeman who had escorted the occupant then returned to the hallway, making some comment about the death of the individual. First, per conflicting reports, an officer took one of the youths into a room and fired a shot into the wall, to make the prisoners believe he was dead. He then asked Guardsman Ted Thomas if he wanted to kill one. Thomas then took an occupent into a room and shot into the ceiling.[18] 19-year-old Aubrey Pollard was then taken to room A-3 by Officer Ronald August. August would later admit to Pollard's killing, stating it was in self-defense. A spent cartridge found next to Pollard was a .300 Savage, a type used for sporting rifles, and not issued to police officers.[7] Pollard had extensive injuries to his head. Witnesses described how he had been beaten on the head with a rifle, with force enough to break the rifle. The remaining occupants then admitted that Cooper had had a starter pistol and had used it earlier.[21] The sound of gunshots was then heard outside the motel and the police officers left. Two remaining officers escorted the remaining prisoners out of the motel annex and told them to run home or they would be killed too.[14] The death of the third youth, Fred Temple, occurred at that time or later. Several of the prisoners who were allowed to leave recalled Temple still being alive when they exited the motel. However, 18-year-old Temple's body was later found in room A-3. He had been shot by Officer Robert Paille, who later testified it was in self-defense during a struggle over his gun.[18]\\r\\nThe officers did not report the deaths to the Detroit Police Homicide Bureau as required. On July 26, 1967, Charles Hendrix, whose security firm provided security for the Algiers, found the bodies in the annex and reported the deaths to the Wayne County Morgue, which then called the Detroit Police Homicide Bureau.[22] Detectives Edward Hay, Lyle Thayer, a photographer and several patrolmen arrived around 3 a.m. The scene was examined and the bodies removed.[23] A knife was found next to the body in A-2, but no gun was found and the cartridges and shell casings were left. The investigator's activities, including the flashes from the camera and the presence of police on the roof of the building, were noticed by Guardsmen stationed nearby and they shouted a challenge to identify themselves.[24] The detectives left the scene to return at a later time, feeling it was not safe to stay on scene that night.[25]\\r\\nThe deaths were reported to the press as having happened in an exchange of gunfire with snipers.[26] However, the Detroit Free Press interviewed the witnesses of the events, who all claimed to have been unarmed and that the dead men were not snipers.[7] The deaths were reported to Congressman John Conyers and the NAACP and motel witnesses appeared in a press conference held by Conyers on the conduct of the military and police.[27] The US Department of Justice began an investigation under assistant District Attorney Robert Murphy, who interviewed witnesses.[27] The witnesses' accounts were delivered to Detroit prosecutors on July 29.[27] The Free Press investigated the story and retained a pathologist, Dr. Robert Sillery, to examine the bodies. His conclusions were that all three had been killed inside the home and all had been shot twice, shot from slightly behind and at close range,[7] and in defensive postures.[28]\\r\\nFive days after the incident, the The Detroit News reported the story of one of the survivors, Robert Greene, stating that one of the National Guard warrant officers murdered the men.[29][30]\\r\\nSecurity guard Melvin Dismukes, who was black, was the first to be charged.[31] He was arraigned for the felonious assault of James Sortor and Michael Clark in the first-floor hallway of the annex. He was freed on $1,500 bail. Dismukes's trial took place in May 1968. He was found not guilty of the charge of felonious assault.[32][33] The all-white jury returned the verdict in 13 minutes.[34]\\r\\nOfficer Ronald August, age 28 and Officer Robert Paille, age 31, confessed to taking part in the killings of Pollard and Temple and were charged with murder.[29] Each spent one night in jail and were released on $5,000 bail.[18] August had given a statement to detectives that the three were dead when he arrived, but asked for that statement back and submitted a second statement admitting that he had shot Pollard, in self-defense.[35] At the pretrial examination, Guard Warrant Officer Ted Thomas identified August as the shooter of Pollard and 23-year-old Vice Patrolman David Senak as the officer who did the questioning and beating. Senak had allegedly taken part in the killing of two men earlier in the riot before arriving at the Algiers Motel.[36] Paille's initial confession was ruled inadmissible and August claimed self-defense.[37] Senak appeared as a witness and testified that he had not seen August or Paille fire their weapons. One of the motel survivors, Michael Clark, gave conflicting evidence that August and Paille had taken him into a room and threatened him when Hersey falsely wrote Senak and Thomas had actually done so.[38] Judge DeMascio ruled that August could be indicted for the murder of Pollard, but charges against Paille for the murder of Temple were dropped.[39]\\r\\nThe Citywide Citizens' Action Committee, organized by Dan Aldridge, was formed by a coalition of Detroit black leaders.[40] They held a tribunal of their own, convicting August, Paille, Dismukes and Thomas for their roles in the murders and sentencing them to death. The jury included novelist John Killens and activist Rosa Parks.[41] Without revealing himself, Dismukes attended the tribunal.\\r\\nOn August 23, Dismukes, Paille and Senak were arrested for conspiracy under Michigan law.[42] The conspiracy trial began on September 27 in Recorder's Court.[43] The trial was three days in length. Judge Frank Schemanske dismissed the conspiracy charges in December.[44] Schemanske concluded that while there was \\"unfortunate violence\\" at the motel, it was \\"scarcely surprising\\"[18] but also \\"overzealous\\". He also stated that \\"[the witnesses] in their calculated prevarication to the point of perjury was so blatant as to defeat its object.\\"[45] The decision was appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court[46]but that was later dismissed.\\r\\nThe dismissal of the murder charge against Paille by Judge DeMascio during the pre-trial was appealed by Prosecutor William L. Cahalan. Recorder's Court Judge Geraldine Ford ordered the case back to Judge DeMascio for further testimony. Paille's attorney Norman Lippitt then appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which chose not to hear the case. Lippitt then appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court. In 1970, the Supreme Court ruled that the Wayne County Court of Appeals should determine whether the case could be reopened. In 1971, the Wayne County Court ordered the Recorder's Court to take additional testimony.[18]\\r\\nThe final appeal would be heard in February 1972. Judge George Ryan of Detroit Recorder's Court would dismiss the murder charge in August 1972, stating that Paille's confession was inadmissible because he had not been advised of his Constitutional rights as per the 1966 Miranda Warning law.[47] He cited the testimony of Detroit detective Charles Schlacter, who stated that he \\"viewed both August and Paille\\" as suspects when he took the statements. Schlacter stated that if he had informed them of their rights, they would not have confessed. In Ryan's judgment, the law meant that persons must be advised of their right to remain silent in what was an \\"atmosphere of coercion.\\"[48]\\r\\nThe first-degree murder trial of Ronald August was held in May and June 1969 in Mason, Michigan. It had been moved from Detroit to escape publicity, partly because of a 1968 book on the incident. In opening statements, defense attorney Norman Lippett described Pollard as \\"an antisocial personality\\" and \\"potential killer\\" and the killing by August as \\"justifiable homicide\\" while prosecutor Avery Weiswasser described the killing as \\"murder with malice aforethought and with full premeditation.\\"[49]\\r\\nAugust admitted killing Pollard, describing it as \\"justifiable homicide\\" because Pollard had attempted to grab his shotgun.[49] According to Detroit Free Press reporter Walker Lundy, there were as many descriptions of the shooting as there were witnesses.[50] Two State's witnesses Greene and Hysell, who had been at the motel, failed to appear to testify.[15]\\r\\nGuardsman Thomas took one of the youths into a room and fired a shot into the ceiling. Senak then gave August a shotgun and told August to \\"shoot one.\\" Thomas stated that he heard no sounds of struggle or words between August and Pollard before he saw \\"a flash of clothing, heard a shotgun blast and saw Pollard's body fall.\\" Thomas then told an officer either \\"this was police business\\" or \\"this was bad business\\" and \\"he was leaving.\\"[15] According to Thomas, August said no words throughout the incident.[15]\\r\\nKaren Malloy, one of the two women in the motel, testified at the trial. She had been held in jail for 98 days with a bail of $25,000 which she could not pay until it was reduced to $5,000. Malloy testified that she saw Cooper shoot a starter's pistol at another black youth in a room on the third floor of the motel. The police then shot out the window of the room and the occupants fled. She ran to the room of Robert Greene and hid there until a police officer with a rifle arrived. The officer fired into the closet and a bathroom. Then, he asked if there was anyone in either place. They were all herded into the first floor hallway, where she said several of the black youths were beaten and taken individually into motel rooms. She testified she was not beaten but she had been forcibly stripped naked.[51] She testified that she could not identify August as one of the officers and that she had not seen any of the killings.[20]\\r\\nState Troopers Philip Martin, John Fonger and Archie Davies testified at the trial. All testified to the lineup and beatings going on and officers taking individuals from the line into motel rooms and shooting their guns in a \\"game\\" to frighten the prisoners. Davies and Fonger testified that they heard shots and then a man in blue shirt and riot helmet leave room A-3, ejecting empty shells from a revolver, stating \\"that one tried for my gun\\" and \\"the room is secure.\\" Martin testified that he saw no resistance, no sniper weapons and no arrests made while at the motel. After Fonger reported the events to his supervisor, the supervisor stated that it was \\"in the hands of the Detroit Police and he didn't like what was going on\\" and the Troopers left.[52]\\r\\nOn June 3, August testified in his own defense.[50] He stated that he saw the bodies of Cooper and Temple when he entered the building, and saw a lineup against the wall. He testified that, when asked by Senak, he took Pollard into room A-3 and closed the door. There, Pollard asked if he was going to shoot him. August said he would not and he had never shot anyone. He asked Pollard if he knew anything about a sniper and Pollard said he did not. August testified that Pollard then pushed August's shotgun away and then grabbed the gun. August stated then he tried to fire the gun, but the safety was on. Pollard then came at him and he fired, killing Pollard. He testified \\"I thought he was going to take the gun away from me. He scared me.\\"[50] August testified that he did not file a report immediately after the shooting, as required, on the advice of either Paille or Senak. When August arrived at the station the next day, he found out that no-one else had filed a report. Paille was the only one with a radio and was supposed to have called for an ambulance and squad car. He testified that he, Senak and Paille filed a joint report. Two days later, they were summoned to the station to file individual statements. August admitted lying in his statement to his supervisor, then asking for the statement back to change it, to admit he had taken part in the shootings and had done so in self-defense.[50]\\r\\nThe trial concluded on June 9 with summations by prosecutor Avery Weisswasser and defense attorney Norman Lippitt. Judge William Beer instructed the all-white jury to either convict August of first-degree murder or acquit him. They could not return a verdict of the lesser charges of second-degree murder or manslaughter,[53] as both the defense and the prosecution had requested.[54] According to the Free Press, legal sources described Beer's instructions to the jury as a direction to find an acquittal on the other possible options.[53] Beer's instructions to the jury were criticized by black leaders as \\"having all but guaranteed an acquittal\\" for August.[55] After deliberating for 2 1/2 hours, the jury found August not guilty.[56][54]\\r\\nThe earlier Schemanske decision incensed Kenneth McIntyre, the assistant U.S District Attorney and he pushed to reopen a federal investigation of the killings.[18] The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated the case. J. Edgar Hoover personally reviewed the policemen's statements. He described them as \\"for the most part untrue and were undoubtably furnished in an attempt to cover their activities and the true series of events.\\"[57] On May 3, 1968, a federal grand jury indicted August, Dismukes, Paille and Senak on a charge of conspiring to deny civil rights to the motel occupants.[58] An indictment was not pursued against Thomas because the government wanted his testimony against the others.[18] The federal conspiracy trial was delayed, both by the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, but also the publication of The Algiers Motel Incident. U.S. Judge Stephen Roth was assigned the case. The defense asked for a change of venue. Roth closed the hearings to the press and waited a full year until September 1969 before ruling on the change of venue, ordering the trial to be moved to his hometown of Flint, Michigan.[18]\\r\\nIn January and February 1970, the federal conspiracy trial was held in Flint, Michigan.[59] It, like the August murder trial, had been moved from Detroit partially because of the publication of The Algiers Motel Incident. It meant it was nearly impossible to get any black persons on the jury. Defense lawyer Lippitt represented the policemen and admitted later that he felt the book publishing had helped his case as he felt that no black person in Detroit would be impartial. \\"I wouldn't want a black man on the jury. I was hoping for all the prejudice I could get.\\"[60]\\r\\nThe other woman held prisoner at the motel, Juli Hysell, testified at the trial. She testified about the starter pistol incident and the lineup in the hallway, but could not identify any of the defendants as being present at the motel. James Sortor, another of the black youths held at the motel, did identify the defendants August, Paille and Dismukes as being present at the motel, but he testified that he had not heard any shooting inside the motel.[16] He stated that he \\"was beaten so many times he lost count.\\"[19] Roderick Davis testified that he had heard the shots and the sounds of people running on the stairs.[16] Both Bruno and Sortor testified that Cooper was still alive when the police arrived.[16]\\r\\nSenak's lawyer stated that Temple was shot while being handcuffed after Temple grabbed Senak's service revolver.[61] State Trooper Hubert Rosema testified that he heard scuffling noises and gunshots coming from the room. Senak was overheard to yell \\"He's got my gun\\" multiple times. He testified that afterwards, he went into the room and saw Temple still breathing, lying against the bed. No aid was called for Temple as far as he knew.[62]\\r\\nSeveral witnesses were called to support the charge of a cover-up by August, Paille and Senak to save face. Police Lieutenant Robert Boroni testified about the contents of the July 29 first report the three policemen filed stating that they entered the motel, saw the lineup, saw that the prisoners were already wounded and left. August's July 31 statement stated that he did not fire his gun inside the motel, and he saw no Guardsmen on the premises. Detroit homicide detective Robert Everett testified that August filed a separate statement two hours later that he had shot Pollard in self-defense and that Paille admitted shooting Temple.[63] Police Lieutenant Gerald Hallmark provided a statement that later that day August and Paille asked to revise their statements. According to Hallmark, August said \\"the media have the events all wrong and that he did what he had to do.\\"[64]\\r\\nAfter deliberating for nine hours, an all-white jury found the four not guilty of conspiracy.[65] In a review of the trial, the Detroit Free Press felt that prosecutors Avery Weiswasser and McIntyre were \\"outpointed by Lippitt.\\"[18]\\r\\nAuthor John Hersey wrote a 1968 book about the incident. Hersey interviewed survivors, members of the victims' families, and some of the law enforcement personnel who participated in the raid, and also consulted forensic reports, in identifying the law enforcement personnel involved in the killings. The proceeds from royalties from the book (over 550,000 copies were printed) were turned over to a college scholarship fund for African American students by Knopf.[66] Hersey stated in the book that he \\"will not take any money from any source for the publication of this story.\\"[67]\\r\\nNone of the three Detroit policemen worked again for the Detroit Police. Paille took other jobs including crane operator, construction worker, carpenter and insurance agent.[68] Senak opened a construction business.[68] Dismukes became a security guard for the Detroit Pistons. He received death threats from the Black Panthers.[61] August resigned from the Detroit Police in July 1977.[69] He became a building tradesman. August, Paille and Senak all moved out of Detroit.[61] Lippitt later became an Oakland County Circuit Judge[70] and today practices law in Birmingham, Michigan.[9] The Detroit Police has since become an integrated police force and its commission is elected.\\r\\nIn 1968, Cahalan filed suit to close down the Algiers Motel but was unsuccessful.[71] It re-opened as \\"The Desert Inn\\". The motel and manor house were demolished in 1979.[68] This was done as part of the \\"New Center\\" urban renewal project sponsored in part by General Motors.[72] The Motel was located at 8301 Woodward Avenue, between Woodward and Virginia Park in the geographic center of Detroit. The open space where the motel and the manor house stood is known today as Virginia Park.\\r\\nBoth the Pollard family and the Temple family filed lawsuits against the Detroit Police officers. Settlements were reached in each case. The City of Detroit paid each family $62,500 to settle.[73] Larry Reed left The Dramatics after the incident,[74] and today sings in church choirs.[75]\\r\\nIn 2013, Mercilee Jenkins' play \\"Spirit of Detroit\\" was performed at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. The play is centered on the stories of Anthony, a black man, and Lucy, a white woman who were friends in childhood and reunited during the 1967 riot, at the Algiers Motel hiding out from the violence.[76]\\r\\nIn 2017, Annapurna Pictures released Detroit, a feature film dramatization of the 12th Street Riot and the Algiers Motel incident, directed by Kathryn Bigelow.[76] Hysell acted as a special advisor on the film and was present every day on the set.[77] The movie soundtrack includes a singing performance by Larry Reed of Algee Smith's song \\"Grow\\".[74]\\r\\nCoordinates: 422234N 830439W? / ?42.376121N 83.077510W? / 42.376121; -83.077510","input":"What happened in the hotel in detroit michigan?"},{"output":"1.8 billion","context":"Adherents of Islam constitute the world's second largest religious group.

Due to travel concerns and the sheer number of games, pairs of teams are never scheduled to play single games against each other (except in the instance of making up a postponed game); instead they play games on several consecutive days in the same ballpark. Most often the series are of three or four games, but two-game series are also scheduled. Teams play one mid-week series and one weekend series per week. Depending on the length of the series, mid-week series games are usually scheduled between Monday and Thursday, while weekend games are scheduled between Thursday and Monday. Beginning in 2018, teams start and end their season on a weekend for a total of 26? weeks. Due to the mid-week all-star break in July, teams are scheduled to play 27 weekend series and 25 mid-week series for a total of 52 series (24 divisional series, 20 inter-divisional series, 8 inter-league series). A team's road games are usually grouped into a multi-series road trip; home series are grouped into homestands.\\r\\nNote that rainouts and other cancellations are often rescheduled ad hoc during the season, sometimes as doubleheaders. However, if two teams are scheduled to meet for the final time in the last two weeks of the season, and the game is cancelled, it may not be rescheduled if there's no impact on the divisional or wild card races. For example, in 2016, the September 29 game between the Cleveland Indians and Detroit Tigers was cancelled due to rain because the teams were unable to reschedule a make-up date before the end of the season on October 2, and it didn't affect the divisional race. In contrast, a 2008 AL Central division game between Detroit and the Chicago White Sox needed to be made up following the last day of the regular season because it affected a division race involving the White Sox and the Minnesota Twins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis account gives the length of the major league \\"championship season\\" schedule by league and year. It does not cover the curtailment of play by war (1918) or by strikes and lockouts (1972, 1981, 1994). The schedules for 1995 were revised and shortened from 162 to 144 games, after late resolution of the strike that had begun in 1994 required a delay in the season to accommodate limited spring training.\\r\\nThe listed years are those in which the league revised its schedule. For example, the National League (NL) scheduled 84 games during 1879, 1880, 1881, and 1882 ÿ that is, four seasons from 1879, ending before 1883, the next listing. 1876 is listed here for convenience although the NL did not schedule games (see 1871 to 1876, below).\\r\\n1882 ÿ 1891\\r\\nThus the AA expanded its schedule to 140 games two years before the National League did so. After 1891 four AA clubs joined the NL and four were bought out, nominally creating one big league, the \\"National League and American Association\\" of 12 clubs.\\r\\n1884\\r\\n1890\\r\\n1914: 1915\\r\\nThe National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (1871ÿ1875) did not schedule games, nor did it control the number of teams, a major reason for its demise after the 1875 season. Clubs paid a $10 entry fee, later $20, to enter the Association for one season, and thereby declare for that year's national championship. Without continuing membership or heavy investment, there was little to deter a team from breaking a commitment, and though it happened, it was mainly due to clubs going out of business.\\r\\nThe National League organized for 1876 on a different basis, granting exclusive memberships to eight clubs that would continue from year to year  it was generally expected, if only because membership would be profitable. But the new league followed its predecessor in merely agreeing that each club would play a certain number of matches to a decision (excluding ties) by a certain date. Boston played 70 games with its quota of ten decisions against every rival. The others achieved 56 to 68 decisions, 64 to 66 for the four western teams as the teams from New York and Philadelphia (eastern) abandoned their schedule-concluding road trips.\\r\\nFor all six early seasons, prior to the first league schedule in 1877, member clubs scheduled their own matches by mutual arrangement, including championship games necessarily with member clubs, other games with members, and games with non-member clubs. Some may have practically dictated their arrangements with some others, but there was no central control or coordination.\\r\\nThis listing gives the greatest number of games played by any club for each season. Naturally, the leader by games played was always a strong club fielding one of the better gate attractions.\\r\\nThe leading numbers of games played to a decision were 33, 54, 59, 71, 82, and 70 decisions; by the listed teams except the Mutuals in 1872.\\r\\nSince 1998, there have been 30 major league teams with a single advance schedule for every season that comprises 2430 games. Each team plays 162 games, 81 as the \\"home\\" team, 81 as the \\"visitor\\". (This is true even on the rare occasion when a game is played at a ballpark not home to either team.) Occasionally, the advance schedule is subsequently altered due to a game postponement or a one-game tie-breaker to determine which team will play in the postseason.\\r\\nBefore 2013 the schedule included 252 \\"interleague games\\" that matched one team from the American League and one from the National League; the other 2178 games matched a pair from within one league. About half of the latter matched teams from within one division and about half matched teams from different divisions in one league. In the Central Division of the National League, which alone had six teams, every pair of division rivals played 15 or 16 games. Within the other, smaller divisions every pair of teams played 18 or 19 games.\\r\\nDivision games (1091). There are 61 pairs of teams from within one division.\\r\\nOther intraleague games (1087). There are 150 pairs of teams from two different divisions within one league.\\r\\nThe schedule for interleague play comprised 84 three-game series in each season from 1998 to 2012, divided as six series (18 games) for each of fourteen AL teams and as many as six for each of sixteen NL teams.\\r\\nAmong the 224 interleague pairs of teams, 11 played six games every year, which were scheduled in two three-game series \\"home and home\\", or one at each home ballpark. Five of these 11 special arrangements matched two teams in the same city or in neighboring cities, where they wholly or partly share territorial rights. Six were regional matches at greater distance, four of which were in the same state.\\r\\nThese special local and regional series accounted for 66 interleague games annually from 1998-2012, and the other 186 games were determined by rotation.\\r\\nThe 2001 season was suspended for one week due to the September 11 terrorist attacks and resulting disruptions in travel, resulting in games scheduled for September 11ÿ16 being rescheduled to the first week of October and the playoffs and World Series being rescheduled one week later than their originally planned dates, which resulted in the World Series continuing into early November.\\r\\nSchedule changes for 2013, precipitated by realignment that created two equal-sized leagues of 15 teams each, gave every team 20 interleague games.[2] Sixteen of which were determined by a match of divisions, one from each league; all teams in a given division play all teams in a given division from the other league. (Each plays a three-game series against four teams from the designated division and two two-game series against the remaining team.)\\r\\nThe matched divisions rotate annually:\\r\\nEach team played its four other interleague games against a designated \\"natural rival\\", with two games in each club's city. Thus all 30 teams, rather than 22 of 30 as previously, were deemed to have a natural rival in the other league. In 2013 the natural rivalry games were all scheduled for May 27 to May 30 (Memorial Day weekend) but in 2014 their scheduled dates range from May to August.\\r\\nTen of the natural rivalries from 2012 and earlier continued, while the HoustonÿTexas \\"Lone Star\\" rivalry had been transformed into an intra-division one with 19 games played. Five of the special arrangements were new in 2013 , including one each for Houston and Texas.\\r\\nFor 2014, four (4) of the five (5) new rivalries have been revised (?), all except Detroit and Pittsburgh.\\r\\nEvery team now plays 19 games against each of 4 opponents within its division (76 games), and 6 or 7 games against each of 10 opponents from other divisions within its own league (66 games).\\r\\nWhen corresponding divisions (i.e. NL East vs. AL East) play each other, a slight adjustment was made to the interleague games. Teams now play 6 games against their rival and 4 games (home and home) against two opponents plus one home and one away 3 game series (14 total) against the other four teams in the opposing division. This was done in 2015, and will next occur in 2018.\\r\\nUnder the new collective bargaining agreement reached in December 2016, several changes were done to the scheduling pattern for the 2018 season. The overall length of the season has been extended to 187 days with the addition of four off-days for all teams. All teams will play on Opening Day, which for 2018 will be held on March 29. Sunday Night Baseball will no longer be played on the final Sunday before the All-Star Game, in order to ease travel time for those who are participating in the Home Run Derby. A single, nationally-televised afternoon game will be played the following Thursday, with all other teams returning to play on Friday.[3][4]\\r\\nStart of Major League Baseball games depends on days of the week, game number in series, holidays, and other factors. Most games start at 7pm in the local time zone, so there are more night games than day games even though baseball is traditionally played during the day. The reason why there are more night baseball games is to attract more fans to ballparks as well as viewers from home because most fans would be at work or school during the day. On Mondays (excluding Opening Day and holidays), Tuesdays, and Fridays, games are almost exclusively played at night except for Cubs home games. Getaway days, days on which teams play their last game of the series before departing for another series in another city the next day, are usually day games, mainly Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. On Sundays, usually all but one are day games, with the final game reserved for ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball.\\r\\nAbout half of Saturday games are day games (1, 2 or 4pm ET). In some markets, Saturday night start an hour earlier than usual night start times, but other cities start Saturday night games at the same time as weeknight games. In conclusion, weekday games are only played at night except for getaway days while many weekend games are played during the day.\\r\\nThe initial pitch typically occurs 5 or 10 minutes after the hour, in order to allow time for pre-game ceremonies.","input":"Mlb how many times do teams play each other?"},{"output":"In 1833","context":"","input":"When did charles dickens start his writing career?"},{"output":"Boban Marjanovi?","context":"\\r\\nThis is a  list of the tallest players in National Basketball Association history.

The vice president is indirectly elected, together with the president, to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College.[5] The Office of the Vice President of the United States assists and organizes the vice president's official functions.\\r\\nAs the president of the United States Senate,[3] the vice president votes only when it is necessary to break a tie. While Senate customs have created supermajority rules that have diminished this constitutional tie-breaking authority, the vice president still retains the ability to influence legislation; for example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was passed in the Senate by a tie-breaking vice presidential vote.[3][6][7]\\r\\nWhile the vice president's only constitutionally prescribed functions aside from presidential succession relate to their role as President of the Senate, the role of the vice president evolved during the 20th century into more of an executive branch position. Currently, the vice president is usually seen as an integral part of a president's administration and presides over the Senate only on ceremonial occasions or when a tie-breaking vote may be needed.[8] The Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch, causing a dispute among scholars whether it belongs to the executive branch, the legislative branch, or both.[9][10][11][12] The modern view of the vice president as a member of the executive branch is due in part to the assignment of executive duties to the vice president by either the president or Congress.[9]\\r\\nMike Pence of Indiana is the 48th and current vice president. He assumed office on January 20, 2017.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formation of the office of vice president resulted directly from the compromise reached at the Philadelphia Convention which created the Electoral College. The delegates at Philadelphia agreed that each state would receive a number of presidential electors equal to the sum of that state's allocation of Representatives and Senators. The delegates assumed that electors would typically choose to favor any candidate from their state (the so-called \\"favorite son\\" candidate) over candidates from other states. Under a plurality election process, this would tend to result in electing candidates solely from the largest states. Consequently, the delegates agreed that presidents must be elected by an absolute majority of the number of electors. Yet, the delegates also assumed that the requirement of an absolute majority for an election might not be sufficient to entice electors to vote for candidates who were from another state, since such a vote might be viewed by their constituents as a vote against their own state, imposing too steep a political cost on that elector's choice and ultimately resulting in elections which failed to produce a winner. To counter this potential difficulty, the delegates further agreed to give each elector two votes, requiring that at least one of their votes must be for a candidate from outside the elector's state, believing that this second vote could be cast without political cost for a statesman of national character.[14]\\r\\nHowever, even under that system, the delegates feared that electors might attempt to game the election, strategically throwing away their second vote in order to bolster their favorite son's chance of winning. To guard against such stratagems, the Philadelphia delegates specified that the first runner-up presidential candidate would become vice president. Creating this new office imposed a political cost on strategically discarded electoral votes, incentivizing electors to make their choices for president without resort to electoral gamesmanship and to cast their second ballot accordingly.[14]\\r\\nThe process for selecting the vice president was later modified in the Twelfth Amendment. Each elector still receives two votes, but now only one of those votes is for president, while the other is for vice president. The requirement that one of those votes be cast for a candidate not from the elector's own state remains in effect. The emergence of national political parties in the late-18th and early-19th centuries, their processes of nomination candidates for each office, their nominations of party loyalists for election to Electoral College positions, the Twelfth Amendment, and the consequent turn of presidential campaigns towards seeking to maximize their electoral vote totals have alleviated much of the electoral gamesmanship that caused concern for the delegates at Philadelphia.\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution limits the formal powers and role of vice president to becoming president,[15][16] should the president become unable to serve, prompting the well-known expression \\"only a heartbeat away from the presidency,\\" and to acting as the presiding officer of the U.S. Senate. Other statutorily granted roles include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.[17][18]\\r\\nAs President of the Senate, the vice president has two primary duties: to cast a vote in the event of a Senate deadlock and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U.S. Electoral College. For example, in the first half of 2001, the Senators were divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. The Democrats had the majority from January 3 to noon January 20 with Al Gore's tie-breaking vote. Dick Cheney's tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority until June 6, 2001 when Jim Jeffords left the Republican Party.\\r\\nAs President of the Senate (Article I, Section 3, Clause 4), the vice president oversees procedural matters and may cast a tie-breaking vote. There is a strong convention within the U.S. Senate that the vice president should not use their position as President of the Senate to influence the passage of legislation or act in a partisan manner, except in the case of breaking tie votes. As President of the Senate, John Adams cast 29 tie-breaking votes that was later surpassed by John C. Calhoun with 31; no other vice president since then has ever threatened this record.[19] Adams's votes protected the president's sole authority over the removal of appointees, influenced the location of the national capital, and prevented war with Great Britain. On at least one occasion Adams persuaded senators to vote against legislation he opposed, and he frequently addressed the Senate on procedural and policy matters. Adams's political views and his active role in the Senate made him a natural target for critics of George Washington's administration. Toward the end of his first term, a threatened resolution that would have silenced him except for procedural and policy matters caused him to exercise more restraint in hopes of seeing his election as President of the United States.\\r\\nFormerly, the vice president would preside regularly over Senate proceedings, but in modern times, the vice president rarely presides over day-to-day matters in the Senate; in their place, the Senate chooses a President pro tempore (or \\"president for a time\\") to preside in the vice president's absence; the Senate normally selects the longest-serving senator in the majority party. The President pro tempore has the power to appoint any other senator to preside, and in practice junior senators from the majority party are assigned the task of presiding over the Senate at most times.\\r\\nExcept for this tie-breaking role, the Standing Rules of the Senate vest no significant responsibilities in the vice president. Rule XIX, which governs debate, does not authorize the vice president to participate in debate, and grants only to members of the Senate (and, upon appropriate notice, former presidents of the United States) the privilege of addressing the Senate, without granting a similar privilege to the sitting vice president. Thus, as Time magazine wrote during the controversial tenure of Vice President Charles G. Dawes, \\"once in four years the Vice President can make a little speech, and then he is done. For four years he then has to sit in the seat of the silent, attending to speeches ponderous or otherwise, of deliberation or humor.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe President of the Senate also presides over counting and presentation of the votes of the Electoral College.[5] This process occurs in the presence of both houses of Congress, generally on January 6 of the year following a U.S. presidential election.[21] In this capacity, only four vice presidents have been able to announce their own election to the presidency: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, and George H. W. Bush. At the beginning of 1961, it fell to Richard Nixon to preside over this process, which officially announced the election of his 1960 opponent, John F. Kennedy. In 2001, Al Gore announced the election of his opponent, George W. Bush. In 1969, Vice President Hubert Humphrey would have announced the election of his opponent, Richard Nixon; however, on the date of the Congressional joint session (January 6), Humphrey was in Norway attending the funeral of Trygve Lie, the first elected Secretary-General of the United Nations. The president pro tempore presided in Humphrey's absence.[22]\\r\\nIn 1933, incumbent Vice President Charles Curtis announced the election of House Speaker John Nance Garner as his successor, while Garner was seated next to him on the House dais. The President of the Senate may also preside over most of the impeachment trials of federal officers. However, whenever the President of the United States is impeached, the US Constitution requires the Chief Justice of the United States to preside over the Senate for the trial. The Constitution is silent as to the presiding officer in the instance where the vice president is the officer impeached.[23]\\r\\nThe U.S. Constitution (Article II, Section 1, Clause 6) provides that \\"In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, ...\\"[24] Initially, it was unclear whether this meant the vice president became the new president or merely an acting president. This was first tested in 1841 with the death of President William Henry Harrison. Harrison's vice president, John Tyler, asserted that he had succeeded to the full presidential office, powers, and title, and declined to acknowledge documents referring to him as \\"Acting President.\\" Despite some strong calls against it, Tyler took the oath of office as the nation's tenth President. Although some in Congress denounced Tyler's claim as a violation of the Constitution,[24] it was not challenged legally, and so the Tyler precedent of full succession was established. This was made explicit by Section 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1967. In total, nine Vice Presidents have succeeded to the presidency. In addition to Tyler they are, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester A. Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Gerald Ford.\\r\\nSection 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment provides for vice presidential succession:\\r\\nWhenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.\\r\\nGerald Ford was the first vice president selected by this method, after the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew in 1973; after succeeding to the presidency, Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller as vice president.[24]\\r\\nAnother issue was who had the power to declare that an incapacitated president is unable to discharge his duties. This question had arisen most recently with the illnesses of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Sections 3 and 4 of the amendment provide means for the vice president to become acting president upon the temporary disability of the president. Section 3 deals with self-declared incapacity of the president. Section 4 deals with incapacity declared by the joint action of the vice president and of a majority of the Cabinet or of such other body as Congress may by law provide. While Section 4 has never been invoked, Section 3 has been invoked three times: on July 13, 1985 when Ronald Reagan underwent surgery to remove cancerous polyps from his colon, and twice more on June 29, 2002 and July 21, 2007 when George W. Bush underwent colonoscopy procedures requiring sedation. Prior to this amendment, Vice President Richard Nixon informally assumed some of President Dwight Eisenhower's duties for several weeks on each of three occasions when Eisenhower was ill.[24]\\r\\nThe extent of any informal roles and functions of the vice president depend on the specific relationship between the president and the vice president, but often include tasks such as drafter and spokesperson for the administration's policies, adviser to the president, and being a symbol of American concern or support. The influence of the vice president in this role depends almost entirely on the characteristics of the particular administration. Dick Cheney, for instance, was widely regarded as one of President George W. Bush's closest confidants. Al Gore was an important adviser to President Bill Clinton on matters of foreign policy and the environment. Often, vice presidents are chosen to act as a \\"balance\\" to the president, taking either more moderate or radical positions on issues.\\r\\nUnder the American system the president is both head of state and head of government, and the ceremonial duties of the former position are often delegated to the vice president. The vice president is often assigned the ceremonial duties of representing the president and the government at state funerals or other functions in the United States. This often is the most visible role of the vice president, and has occasionally been the subject of ridicule, such as during the vice presidency of George H. W. Bush. The vice president may meet with other heads of state or attend state funerals in other countries, at times when the administration wishes to demonstrate concern or support but cannot send the president themselves.\\r\\nIn recent decades, the vice presidency has frequently been used as a platform to launch bids for the presidency. The transition of the office to its modern stature occurred primarily as a result of Franklin Roosevelt's 1940 nomination, when he captured the ability to nominate his running mate instead of leaving the nomination to the convention. Prior to that, party bosses often used the vice presidential nomination as a consolation prize for the party's minority faction. A further factor potentially contributing to the rise in prestige of the office was the adoption of presidential preference primaries in the early 20th century. By adopting primary voting, the field of candidates for vice president was expanded by both the increased quantity and quality of presidential candidates successful in some primaries, yet who ultimately failed to capture the presidential nomination at the convention.\\r\\nOf the thirteen presidential elections from 1956 to 2004, nine featured the incumbent president; the other four (1960, 1968, 1988, 2000) all featured the incumbent vice president. Former vice presidents also ran, in 1984 (Walter Mondale), and in 1968 (Richard Nixon, against the incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey). The presidential election of 2008 was the first presidential election since 1928 that saw neither an incumbent president nor an incumbent or former vice president, take part in any primary or general election for the presidency on a major party ticket. Nixon is the only vice president to have been elected president while not an incumbent, as well as the only person elected twice to both the presidency and vice presidency.\\r\\nThe Twelfth Amendment states that \\"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.\\"[25] Thus, to serve as vice president, an individual must:\\r\\nAdditionally, Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment denies eligibility for any federal office to anyone who, having sworn an oath to support the United States Constitution, later has rebelled against the United States. This disqualification, originally aimed at former supporters of the Confederacy, may be removed by a two-thirds vote of each house of the Congress.\\r\\nUnder the Twenty-second Amendment, the President of the United States may not be elected to more than two terms. However, there is no similar limitation on how many times one can be elected vice president. Scholars disagree whether a former president barred from election to the presidency is also ineligible to be elected or appointed vice president, as suggested by the Twelfth Amendment.[27][28] Age, nation of birth, and length of residency in the U.S. are eligibility requirements easily tested by reference to established facts, but the contingent and uncertain nature of vice presidential lines of succession mean that an otherwise eligible American citizen who had been elected as President for two terms might not therefore lose eligibility for the vice presidency if he or she is later appointed by Congress to the vice presidency through procedures codified by the Presidential Succession Act. However, this scenario has not yet been tested. Also, Article I, Section 3, Clause 7 allows the Senate, upon voting (by two-thirds) to remove an impeached federal official from office, to disqualify that official from holding any federal office.\\r\\nWhile it is commonly held that the president and vice president must be residents of different states, this is not actually the case. Nothing in the Constitution prohibits both candidates being from a single state.\\r\\nInstead, the limitation in the Twelfth Amendment imposed is on the members of the Electoral College, who must cast a ballot for at least one candidate who is not from their own state.\\r\\nIn theory, the candidates elected could both be from one state, but the electors of that state would, in a close electoral contest, run the risk of denying their vice presidential candidate the absolute majority required to secure the election, even if the presidential candidate is elected. This would then place the vice presidential election in the hands of the Senate.\\r\\nIn practice, however, residency is rarely an issue. Parties have avoided nominating tickets containing two candidates from the same state. Further, the candidates may themselves take action to alleviate any residency conflict. For example, at the start of the 2000 election cycle Dick Cheney was a resident of Texas; Cheney quickly changed his residency back to Wyoming, where he had previously served as a U.S. Representative, when Texas governor and Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush asked Cheney to be his vice presidential candidate.\\r\\nThough the vice president does not need to have any political experience, most major-party vice presidential nominees are current or former United States Senators or Representatives, with the occasional nominee being a current or former Governor, a high-ranking military officer, or a holder of a major post within the Executive Department. The vice presidential candidates of the major national political parties are formally selected by each party's quadrennial nominating convention, following the selection of the party's presidential candidates. The official process is identical to the one by which the presidential candidates are chosen, with delegates placing the names of candidates into nomination, followed by a ballot in which candidates must receive a majority to secure the party's nomination.\\r\\nIn practice, the presidential nominee has considerable influence on the decision, and in the 20th century it became customary for that person to select a preferred running mate, who is then nominated and accepted by the convention. In recent years, with the presidential nomination usually being a foregone conclusion as the result of the primary process, the selection of a vice presidential candidate is often announced prior to the actual balloting for the presidential candidate, and sometimes before the beginning of the convention itself. The first presidential aspirant to announce his selection for vice president before the beginning of the convention was Ronald Reagan who, prior to the 1976 Republican National Convention announced that Richard Schweiker would be his running mate. Reagan's supporters then sought to amend the convention rules so that Gerald R. Ford would be required to name his vice presidential running mate in advance as well. The proposal was defeated, and Reagan did not receive the nomination in 1976. Often, the presidential nominee will name a vice presidential candidate who will bring geographic or ideological balance to the ticket or appeal to a particular constituency.\\r\\nThe vice presidential candidate might also be chosen on the basis of traits the presidential candidate is perceived to lack, or on the basis of name recognition. To foster party unity, popular runners-up in the presidential nomination process are commonly considered. While this selection process may enhance the chances of success for a national ticket, in the past it often insured that the vice presidential nominee represented regions, constituencies, or ideologies at odds with those of the presidential candidate. As a result, vice presidents were often excluded from the policy-making process of the new administration. Many times their relationships with the president and his staff were aloof, non-existent, or even adversarial.\\r\\nThe ultimate goal of vice presidential candidate selection is to help and not hurt the party's chances of getting elected, nonetheless several vice presidential selections have been controversial. In 1984, Democratic nominee Walter Mondale's groundbreaking choice of Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate (the first woman in U.S. history nominated for Vice President by a major political party), became a drag on the ticket due to repeated questions about her husband's finances. A selection whose positive traits make the presidential candidate look less favorable in comparison or which can cause the presidential candidate's judgment to be questioned often backfire, such as in 1988 when Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis chose experienced Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen; Bentsen was considered a more seasoned statesman in federal politics and somewhat overshadowed Dukakis. Questions about Dan Quayle's experience were raised in the 1988 presidential campaign of George H. W. Bush, but the Bush-Quayle ticket still won handily. James Stockdale, the choice of third-party candidate Ross Perot in 1992, was seen as unqualified by many and Stockdale had little preparation for the vice presidential debate, but the Perot-Stockdale ticket still won about 19% of the vote. In 2008, Republican John McCain chose Sarah Palin as his running mate over his primary rivals and/or campaign surrogates such as Mitt Romney or Tom Ridge. This surprise move would, it was hoped, draw women voters disappointed by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the Democratic presidential primaries into the McCain camp. Palin's selection soon came to be seen as a negative for McCain, due to her several controversies during her gubernatorial tenure which were highlighted by the press, and her feuding with McCain campaign chairman Steve Schmidt. This perception continued to grow throughout the campaign, especially after her interviews with Katie Couric led to concerns about her fitness for the presidency.[29]\\r\\nHistorically, vice presidential candidates were chosen to provide geographic and ideological balance to a presidential ticket, widening a presidential candidate's appeal to voters from outside his regional base or wing of the party. Candidates from electoral-vote rich states were usually preferred. However, in 1992, moderate Democrat Bill Clinton (of Arkansas) chose moderate Democrat Al Gore (of Tennessee) as his running mate. Despite the two candidates' near-identical ideological and regional backgrounds, Gore's extensive experience in national affairs enhanced the appeal of a ticket headed by Clinton, whose political career had been spent entirely at the local and state levels of government. In 2000, George W. Bush chose Dick Cheney of Wyoming, a reliably Republican state with only three electoral votes, and in 2008, Barack Obama mirrored Bush's strategy when he chose Joe Biden of Delaware, a reliably Democratic state, likewise one with only three electoral votes. Both Cheney and Biden were chosen for their experience in national politics (experience lacked by both Bush and Obama) rather than the ideological balance or electoral vote advantage they would provide.\\r\\nThe first presidential candidate to choose his vice presidential candidate was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.[30] The last not to name a vice presidential choice, leaving the matter up to the convention, was Democrat Adlai Stevenson in 1956. The convention chose Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver over Massachusetts Senator (and later president) John F. Kennedy. At the tumultuous 1972 Democratic convention, presidential nominee George McGovern selected Senator Thomas Eagleton as his running mate, but numerous other candidates were either nominated from the floor or received votes during the balloting. Eagleton nevertheless received a majority of the votes and the nomination, though he later resigned from the ticket, resulting in Sargent Shriver becoming McGovern's final running mate; both lost to the Nixon-Agnew ticket by a wide margin, carrying only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.\\r\\nIn cases where the presidential nomination is still in doubt as the convention approaches, the campaigns for the two positions may become intertwined. In 1976, Ronald Reagan, who was trailing President Gerald R. Ford in the presidential delegate count, announced prior to the Republican National Convention that, if nominated, he would select Senator Richard Schweiker as his running mate. This move backfired to a degree, as Schweiker's relatively liberal voting record alienated many of the more conservative delegates who were considering a challenge to party delegate selection rules to improve Reagan's chances. In the end, Ford narrowly won the presidential nomination and Reagan's selection of Schweiker became moot.\\r\\nIn the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries which pitted Hillary Clinton against Barack Obama, Clinton suggested a Clinton-Obama ticket with Obama in the vice president slot as it would be \\"unstoppable\\" against the presumptive Republican nominee. Obama rejected the offer outright saying \\"I want everybody to be absolutely clear. I'm not running for vice president. I'm running for president of the United States of America\\" while noting \\"With all due respect. I won twice as many states as Sen. Clinton. I've won more of the popular vote than Sen. Clinton. I have more delegates than Sen. Clinton. So, I don't know how somebody who's in second place is offering vice presidency to the person who's in first place\\". Obama stated that the nomination process would have to be a choice between himself and Clinton, saying \\"I don't want anybody here thinking that 'Somehow, maybe I can get both'\\", by nominating Clinton as president and assuming he would be her running mate\\".[31][32] Some suggested that it was a ploy by the Clinton campaign to denigrate Obama as less qualified for the presidency.[33] Later, when Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee, former President Jimmy Carter cautioned against Clinton being picked for the vice president slot on the ticket, saying \\"I think it would be the worst mistake that could be made. That would just accumulate the negative aspects of both candidates\\", citing opinion polls showing 50% of US voters with a negative view of Hillary Clinton.[34]\\r\\nVice presidents are elected indirectly in the United States. A number of electors, collectively known as the Electoral College, officially select the president and vice president. On Election Day, voters in each of the states and the District of Columbia cast ballots for these electors. Each state is allocated a number of electors, equal to the size of its delegation in both Houses of Congress combined. Generally, the ticket that wins the most votes in a state wins all of that state's electoral votes and thus has its slate of electors chosen to vote in the Electoral College.\\r\\nThe winning slate of electors meet at its state's capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, to vote. They then send a record of that vote to Congress. The vote of the electors is opened by the sitting vice president, acting in his capacity as President of the Senate and read aloud to a joint session of the incoming Congress, which was elected at the same time as the president and vice president.\\r\\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the vice president's term of office begins at noon on January 20 of the year following the election. This date, known as Inauguration Day, marks the beginning of the four-year terms of both the president and vice president.\\r\\nAlthough Article VI requires that the vice president take an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the US Constitution, unlike the president, the United States Constitution does not specify the precise wording of the oath of office for the vice president. Several variants of the oath have been used since 1789; the current form, which is also recited by Senators, Representatives and other government officers, has been used since 1884:\\r\\nI, (first name last name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.[35][36]\\r\\nThe term of office for vice president is four years. While the Twenty-Second Amendment generally restricts the president to two terms, there is no such limitation on the office of vice president, meaning an eligible person could hold the office as long as voters continued to vote for electors who in turn would reelect the person to the office. Additionally, a vice president could even serve under different presidents. George Clinton and John C. Calhoun both did so during the early 1800s.\\r\\nUnder the original terms of the Constitution, the electors of the Electoral College voted only for office of president rather than for both president and vice president. Each elector was allowed to vote for two people for the top office. The person receiving the greatest number of votes (provided that such a number was a majority of electors) would be president, while the individual who received the next largest number of votes became vice president. If no one received a majority of votes, then the House of Representatives would choose among the five candidates with the largest numbers of votes, with each state's representatives together casting a single vote. In such a case, the person who received the highest number of votes but was not chosen president would become vice president. In the case of a tie for second, then the Senate would choose the vice president.[37]\\r\\nThe original plan, however, did not foresee the development of political parties and their adversarial role in the government. For example, in the election of 1796, Federalist John Adams came in first, but because the Federalist electors had divided their second vote amongst several vice presidential candidates, Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson came second. Thus, the president and vice president were from opposing parties. Predictably, Adams and Jefferson clashed over issues such as states' rights and foreign policy.[38]\\r\\nA greater problem occurred in the election of 1800, in which the two participating parties each had a secondary candidate they intended to elect as vice president, but the more popular Democratic-Republican party failed to execute that plan with their electoral votes. Under the system in place at the time (Article II, Section 1, Clause 3), the electors could not differentiate between their two candidates, so the plan had been for one elector to vote for Thomas Jefferson but not for Aaron Burr, thus putting Burr in second place. This plan broke down for reasons that are disputed, and both candidates received the same number of votes. After 35 deadlocked ballots in the House of Representatives, Jefferson finally won on the 36th ballot and Burr became vice president.[39]\\r\\nThis tumultuous affair led to the adoption of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804, which directed the electors to use separate ballots to vote for the president and vice president.[25] While this solved the problem at hand, it ultimately had the effect of lowering the prestige of the vice presidency, as the office was no longer for the leading challenger for the presidency. The separate ballots for president and vice president became something of a moot issue later in the 19th century when it became the norm for popular elections to determine a state's Electoral College delegation.[citation needed] Electors chosen this way are pledged to vote for a particular presidential and vice presidential candidate (offered by the same political party). So, while the Constitution says that the president and vice president are chosen separately, in practice they are chosen together.\\r\\nIf no vice presidential candidate receives an Electoral College majority, then the Senate selects the vice president, in accordance with the United States Constitution. The Twelfth Amendment states that a \\"majority of the whole number\\" of Senators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for election.[40] Further, the language requiring an absolute majority of Senate votes precludes the sitting vice president from breaking any tie which might occur.[41] The election of 1836 is the only election so far where the office of the vice president has been decided by the Senate. During the campaign, Martin Van Buren's running mate Richard Mentor Johnson was accused of having lived with a black woman. Virginia's 23 electors, who were pledged to Van Buren and Johnson, refused to vote for Johnson (but still voted for Van Buren). The election went to the Senate, where Johnson was elected 33-17.\\r\\nThe vice president's salary is $230,700.[42] The salary was set by the 1989 Government Salary Reform Act, which also provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees. The vice president does not automatically receive a pension based on that office, but instead receives the same pension as other members of Congress based on his position as President of the Senate.[43] The vice president must serve a minimum of two years to qualify for a pension.[44]\\r\\nSince 1974, the official residence of the vice president and their family has been Number One Observatory Circle, on the grounds of the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.\\r\\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause 5 and Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution both authorize the House of Representatives to serve as a \\"grand jury\\" with the power to impeach high federal officials, including the president, for \\"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\\" Similarly, Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 and Article II, Section 4 both authorize the Senate to serve as a court with the power to remove impeached officials from office, given a two-thirds vote to convict. No vice president has ever been impeached.\\r\\nPrior to ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency. As a result, when one occurred, the office was left vacant until filled through the next ensuing election and inauguration. Between 1812 and 1967, the vice presidency was vacant on sixteen occasionsas a result of seven deaths,[45] one resignation, and eight cases in which the vice president succeeded to the presidency.\\r\\nSince the Twenty-Fifth Amendment came into force the office has been vacant twice, until the confirmation of a new vice president by both houses of Congress and the swearing in ceremony. The first such instance occurred in 1973 following the resignation of Spiro Agnew, Richard Nixon's vice president. Gerald Ford was subsequently nominated by President Nixon and confirmed by Congress. The second occurred 10 months later when Nixon resigned following the Watergate scandal and Ford assumed the presidency. The resulting vice presidential vacancy was filled by Nelson Rockefeller.[45] Ford and Rockefeller are the only two people to have served as vice president without having been elected to the office, and Ford remains the only person to have served as both vice president and president without being elected to either office.\\r\\nFor much of its existence, the office of vice president was seen as little more than a minor position. John Adams, the first vice president, was the first of many frustrated by the \\"complete insignificance\\" of the office. To his wife Abigail Adams wrote, \\"My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man . . . or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived; and as I can do neither good nor evil, I must be borne away by others and met the common fate.\\"[47] John Nance Garner, who served as vice president from 1933 to 1941 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, claimed that the vice presidency \\"isn't worth a pitcher of warm piss.\\"[48] Harry Truman, who also served as vice president under Roosevelt, said that the office was as \\"useful as a cow's fifth teat.\\"[49]\\r\\nThomas R. Marshall, the 28th vice president, lamented: \\"Once there were two brothers. One ran away to sea; the other was elected Vice President of the United States. And nothing was heard of either of them again.\\"[50] His successor, Calvin Coolidge, was so obscure that Major League Baseball sent him free passes that misspelled his name, and a fire marshal failed to recognize him when Coolidge's Washington residence was evacuated.[51]\\r\\nWhen the Whig Party asked Daniel Webster to run for the vice presidency on Zachary Taylor's ticket, he replied \\"I do not propose to be buried until I am really dead and in my coffin.\\"[52] This was the second time Webster declined the office, which William Henry Harrison had first offered to him. Ironically, both of the presidents making the offer to Webster died in office, meaning the three-time presidential candidate could have become president if he had accepted either. Since presidents rarely died in office, however, the better preparation for the presidency was considered to be the office of Secretary of State, in which Webster served under Harrison, Tyler, and later, Taylor's successor, Fillmore.\\r\\nIn the first 100 years of the United States no fewer than seven proposals to amend the constitution to abolish the office of Vice President were advanced in the United States Congress.[53] The first such amendment was presented by Samuel W. Dana in 1800 and was defeated by a vote of 27 to 85 in the United States House of Representatives.[53] A second proposed amendment, introduced by United States Senator James Hillhouse in 1808 was also defeated.[53] During the late-1860s and 1870s, five additional amendments were proposed.[53] One supporter of the proposals, James Mitchell Ashley , opined that the office of Vice President was \\"superfluous\\" and dangerous.[53]\\r\\nGarret Hobart, the first vice president under William McKinley, was one of the very few vice presidents at this time who played an important role in the administration. A close confidant and adviser of the president, Hobart was called \\"Assistant President.\\"[54] However, until 1919, vice presidents were not included in meetings of the President's Cabinet. This precedent was broken by President Woodrow Wilson when he asked Thomas R. Marshall to preside over Cabinet meetings while Wilson was in France negotiating the Treaty of Versailles.[55] President Warren G. Harding also invited his vice president, Calvin Coolidge, to meetings. The next vice president, Charles G. Dawes, did not seek to attend Cabinet meetings under President Coolidge, declaring that \\"the precedent might prove injurious to the country.\\"[56] Vice President Charles Curtis was also precluded from attending by President Herbert Hoover.\\r\\nIn 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt raised the stature of the office by renewing the practice of inviting the vice president to cabinet meetings, which every president since has maintained. Roosevelt's first vice president, John Nance Garner, broke with him over the \\"court-packing issue, early in his second term, and became Roosevelt's leading critic. At the start of that term, on January 20, 1937, Garner had been the first Vice President to be sworn into office on the Capitol steps in the same ceremony with the president; a tradition that continues. Prior to that time, vice presidents were traditionally inaugurated at a separate ceremony in the Senate chamber. Gerald R. Ford and Nelson A. Rockefeller, who were both appointed to the office under the terms of the 25th amendment, were inaugurated in the House and Senate chambers, respectively.\\r\\nHenry Wallace, Roosevelt's Vice President during his third term (1941ÿ1945), was given major responsibilities during World War II. However, after numerous policy disputes between Wallace and other Roosevelt Administration and Democratic Party officials, he was denied renomination to office at the 1944 Democratic National Convention. Harry Truman was selected instead. During his 82 day vice presidency, Truman was not informed about any war or post-war plans, including the Manhattan Project, leading Truman to remark, wryly, that the job of the Vice President was to \\"go to weddings and funerals.\\" As a result of this experience, Truman, after succeeding to the presidency upon Roosevelt's death, recognized the need to keep the Vice President informed on national security issues. Congress made the vice president one of four statutory members of the National Security Council in 1949.\\r\\nThe stature of the Vice-presidency grew again while Richard Nixon was in office (1953ÿ1961). He attracted the attention of the media and the Republican party, when Dwight Eisenhower authorized him to preside at Cabinet meetings in his absence. Nixon was also the first vice president to formally assume temporary control of the executive branch, which he did after Eisenhower suffered a heart attack on September 24, 1955, ileitis in June 1956, and a stroke in November 1957.\\r\\nUntil 1961, vice presidents had their offices on Capitol Hill, a formal office in the Capitol itself and a working office in the Russell Senate Office Building. Lyndon B. Johnson was the first vice president to be given an office in the White House complex, in the Old Executive Office Building. The former Navy Secretary's office in the OEOB has since been designated the \\"Ceremonial Office of the Vice President\\" and is today used for formal events and press interviews. President Jimmy Carter was the first president to give his vice president, Walter Mondale, an office in the West Wing of the White House, which all vice presidents have since retained. Because of their function as Presidents of the Senate, vice presidents still maintain offices and staff members on Capitol Hill.\\r\\nThough Walter Mondale's tenure was the beginning of the modern day power of the vice presidency, the tenure of Dick Cheney saw a rapid growth in the office of the vice president. Vice President Cheney held a tremendous amount of power and frequently made policy decisions on his own, without the knowledge of the President.[57] After his tenure, and during the 2008 presidential campaign, both vice presidential candidates, Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, stated the office had expanded too much under Cheney's tenure and both claimed they would reduce the role to simply being an adviser to the president.[58] This rapid growth has led to calls for abolition of the vice presidency from various constitutional scholars and political commentators such as: Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Matthew Yglesias, and Bruce Ackerman.[59][60][61]\\r\\nFour vice presidents have been elected to the presidency while serving as vice president: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren and George H. W. Bush. Additionally, John C. Breckinridge, Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey and Al Gore were each nominated by their respective parties, but did not succeed the presidents with whom they were elected, though Nixon was elected president eight years later.\\r\\nTwo vice presidents served under different presidents. George Clinton served under both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, while John C. Calhoun served under John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. In 1900, Adlai Stevenson I, who had earlier served as vice president under Grover Cleveland, ran for another term, this time as William Jennings Bryan's running mate. Charles W. Fairbanks, vice president under Theodore Roosevelt, sought unsuccessfully to return to office as Charles Evans Hughes' running mate in 1916.\\r\\nSome former vice presidents have sought other offices after serving as vice president. Daniel D. Tompkins ran for Governor of New York in 1820 while serving as vice president under James Monroe. He lost to DeWitt Clinton, but was re-elected vice president. John C. Calhoun resigned as vice president to accept election as US Senator from South Carolina. Hannibal Hamlin, Andrew Johnson, Alben Barkley and Hubert H. Humphrey were all elected to the Senate after leaving office. Levi P. Morton, vice president under Benjamin Harrison, was elected Governor of New York after leaving office.\\r\\nAdlai Stevenson I was narrowly defeated for Governor of Illinois in 1908. Richard Nixon unsuccessfully sought the governorship of California in 1962, nearly two years after leaving office as vice president and just over six years before becoming president. Walter Mondale ran unsuccessfully for president in 1984, served as U.S. Ambassador to Japan from 1993 to 1996, and then sought unsuccessfully to return to the Senate in 2002. George H. W. Bush won the presidency, and his vice president, Dan Quayle, sought the Republican nomination in 2000.\\r\\nSince 1977, former presidents and vice presidents who are elected or re-elected to the Senate are entitled to the largely honorific position of Deputy President pro tempore. So far, the only former vice president to have held this title is Hubert Humphrey following his return to the Senate. Walter Mondale would have been entitled to the position had his 2002 Senate bid been successful.\\r\\nUnder the terms of an 1886 Senate resolution, all former vice presidents are entitled to a portrait bust in the Senate wing of the United States Capitol, commemorating their service as presidents of the Senate. Dick Cheney is the most recent former vice president to be so honored.\\r\\nUnlike former presidents, who receive a pension automatically regardless of their time in office, former vice presidents must reach pension eligibility by accumulating the appropriate time in federal service. Since 2008, former vice presidents are also entitled to Secret Service personal protection.[62] Former vice presidents traditionally receive Secret Service protection for up to six months after leaving office, by order of the Secretary of Homeland Security, though this can be extended if the Secretary believes the level of threat is sufficient.[63]\\r\\nIn 2008, a bill titled the \\"Former Vice President Protection Act\\" was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush.[64] It provides six-month Secret Service protection by law to a former vice president and family. According to the Department of Homeland Security, protection for former vice president Cheney has been extended numerous times because threats against him have not decreased since his leaving office.[65]\\r\\nThis is a graphical timeline listing of the Vice Presidents of the United States.","input":"Who is the vice president of the u.s?"},{"output":"Justice H.

On March 1, 2018, Mitchell was named as the Western Conference rookie of the month for the 3rd time this season for games played in February.[21] On April 10, he set a rookie record for most 3s in a season with 186 3s in a 119-79 win over the Golden State Warriors.[citation needed] On April 12, at the end of the regular season, Mitchell was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for March and April.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mitchell's playoff debut against the Oklahoma City Thunder on April 15, he recorded 27 points, 10 rebounds, and 3 assists.[23] However, during the game he bruised his foot and was questionable for Game 2.[24] He played Game 2, scoring 28 points, including 13 in the 4th quarter to lead the Jazz to a 102-95 win.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2017ÿ18 season Mitchell appeared on the cover of SLAM Magazine and is now starring in a documentary.[25][26]","input":"How long is donovan mitchell contract with the utah jazz?"},{"output":"Tokyo Skytree","context":"The world's tallest artificial structure is the 829.8-metre-tall (2,722?ft) Burj Khalifa in Dubai (of the United Arab Emirates). The building gained the official title of \\"Tallest Building in the World\\" and the tallest self-supported structure at its opening on January 9, 2010. The second-tallest self-supporting structure and the tallest tower is the Tokyo Skytree. The tallest guyed structure is the KVLY-TV mast.\\r\\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, an organization that certifies buildings as the \\"World's Tallest\\", recognizes a building only if at least 50% of its height is made up of floor plates containing habitable floor area.[1] Structures that do not meet this criterion, such as the CN Tower, are defined as \\"towers\\".\\r\\nThere are dozens of radio and television broadcasting towers which measure over 600?metres (about 2,000?ft) in height, and only the tallest are recorded in publicly available information sources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assessment of the height of artificial structures has been controversial. Various standards have been used by different organizations which has meant that the title of world's tallest structure or building has changed depending on which standards have been accepted. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat has changed its definitions over time. Some of the controversy regarding the definitions and assessment of tall structures and buildings has included the following:\\r\\nWithin an accepted definition of a building further controversy has included the following factors:\\r\\nThis category does not require the structure to be \\"officially\\" open but does require it to be \\"topped out\\".\\r\\nThe tallest artificial structure is Burj Khalifa, a skyscraper in Dubai that reached 828.1?m (2,717?ft) in height on January 17, 2009.[2] By April 7, 2008 it had been built higher than the KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota, USA.[3] That September it officially surpassed Poland's 646.38?m (2,120.7?ft) Warsaw radio mast, which stood from 1974 to 1991, to become the tallest structure ever built. Guyed lattice towers such as these masts had held the world height record since 1954.\\r\\nThe Petronius Platform stands 610?m (2,000?ft) off the sea floor leading some, including Guinness World Records 2007, to claim it as the tallest freestanding structure in the world. However, it is debated whether underwater height should be counted, in the same manner as height below ground is ignored on buildings. The Troll A platform is 472?m (1,549?ft), without any part of that height being supported by wires. The tension-leg type of oil platform has even greater below-water heights with several examples more than 1,000?m (3,300?ft) deep. However, these platforms are not considered constant structures as the vast majority of their height is made up of the length of the tendons attaching the floating platforms to the sea floor. Despite this, Guinness World Records 2009 listed the Ursa tension leg platform as the tallest structure in the world with a total height of 1,306?m (4,285?ft). The Magnolia Tension-leg Platform in the Gulf of Mexico is even taller with a total height of 1,432?m (4,698?ft).\\r\\nTaipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, set records in three of the four skyscraper categories at the time it opened in 2004; at the time the Burj Khalifa opened in 2010 it remained the world's tallest inhabited building 509.2?m (1,671?ft) as measured to its architectural height (spire). The height of its roof 449.2?m (1,474?ft) and highest occupied floor 439.2?m (1,441?ft) had been surpassed by the Shanghai World Financial Center with corresponding heights of 487 and 474?m (1,598 and 1,555?ft). Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) was the highest in the final category: the greatest height to top of antenna of any building in the world at 527.3?m (1,730?ft).\\r\\nBurj Khalifa broke the height record in all four categories for completed buildings.\\r\\nDue to the disagreements over how to measure height and classify structures, engineers have created various definitions for categories of buildings and other structures. One measure includes the absolute height of a building, another includes only spires and other permanent architectural features, but not antennas. The tradition of including the spire on top of a building and not including the antenna dates back to the rivalry between the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street. A modern-day example is that the antenna on top of Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) is not considered part of its architectural height, while the spires on top of the Petronas Twin Towers are counted.\\r\\nNote: The following table is a list of the tallest completed structure in each of the 53 categories below. There can only be one structure in each category, unless the title for the tallest is a draw.\\r\\n24426N 1014045E? / ?2.740486N 101.679069E? / 2.740486; 101.679069? (Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 Control Tower)\\r\\nThere are some destroyed architectural structures which were taller than the tallest existing structure of their type. There are also destroyed structures omitted from this list that had been surpassed in height prior to being destroyed.\\r\\n* Mixed-Use is defined as having three or more real estate uses (such as retail, office, hotel, etc.) that are physically and functionally integrated in a single property and are mutually supporting.[10]\\r\\nPrior to 1998, the tallest building status was determined by the height of the building to the top of its architectural elements including spires, but not including \\"temporary\\" structures (such as antennas or flagpoles), which could be added or changed relatively easily without requiring major changes to the building's design. Other criteria for height measurement were not used. For this reason, the originally 1,451-foot (442-meter) to rooftop or 1518 feet with original antennas[11] Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) was generally accepted as being the tallest building continuously after its completion in 1973, and being taller than both World Trade Center towers, in spite of the fact the 1 World Trade Center Tower (North Tower) possessed a higher pinnacle absolute height after it added its 360-foot (110?m) radio antenna (total height of 1730 feet or 527.3 meters) in 1978. The 1 World Trade Center building maintained a higher absolute height to antenna top until the Sears Tower enlarged its own radio antenna in 2000 to a total height of 1730 feet.[11] However, the Willis Tower was always considered the taller building because it still possessed a greater height to its architectural top (1451 feet vs. 1362 feet), and thus its status as the world's tallest was generally not contested.\\r\\nOther historic cases in which a building with a taller absolute pinnacle height was not considered the tallest building include, in 1905 when the former New York Times building or The Times Square Building (at 229 West 43rd Street in New York) was completed at 111?m (364?ft) to the roof with 128?m (420?ft) including a flagpole. That building was never considered to be taller than the 119-metre-high (390?ft) then-current record-holder Park Row Building of New York because a flagpole is not an integral architectural part of a building.[12]\\r\\nPrior to 1998 the tallest building status had been contested on occasion, but the disputes did not result in a change of the criteria used to determine the world's tallest building. An example was the rivalry between the Trump Building (then known as the Bank of Manhattan Building) and the Chrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building employed only a short spire and was 927?ft (283?m) tall and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large 125-foot (38?m) spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of 1,048 feet (319?m), despite having a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires are not counted in their heights. Upset by Chryslers victory, Shreve & Lamb, the consulting architects of Bank of Manhattan building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor. They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly 100 feet (30?m) above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and essentially inaccessible.[13] However, the Chrysler Building was generally accepted as the tallest building in the world despite their protests.\\r\\nHowever, none of the previous discrepancies or disputes in criteria to measure height (spires vs antennas, absolute pinnacle height vs. architectural height, height of highest occupied floor, etc.) resulted in the controversy that occurred upon the completion of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998. The Petronas Towers possessed a higher architectural height (spires, but not antennas), but a lower absolute pinnacle height and lower top occupied floor than the previous record-holder Willis Tower in Chicago, United States. Counting buildings as structures with floors throughout, and with antenna masts excluded, Willis Tower was still considered the tallest at that time. When the Petronas Twin Towers were built, controversy arose because their spires extended nine metres higher than the roof of Willis Tower. Excluding their spires, the Petronas Towers are not taller than Willis Tower. At their convention in Chicago, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) found the Willis Tower to be the third-tallest building, and the Petronas Towers to be the world's tallest buildings. This decision caused a considerable amount of controversy in the news media because this was the first time a country outside the United States had held the worlds tallest building record.[12] Therefore, the CTBUH revised their criteria and defined four categories in which the world's tallest building can be measured,[14] by retaining the old criterion of height to architectural top, and adding three new categories:[12]\\r\\nThe height-to-roof criterion was discontinued because relatively few modern tall buildings possess flat rooftops, making this criterion difficult to determine and measure.[16] The CTBUH has further clarified their definitions of building height, including specific criteria concerning subbasements and ground level entrances (height measured from lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance rather than from a previously undefined \\"main entrance\\"), building completion (must be topped out both structurally and architecturally, fully clad, and able to be occupied), condition of the highest occupied floor (must be continuously used by people living or working and be conditioned, thus including observation decks, but not mechanical floors) and other aspects of tall buildings.[16][17]\\r\\nThe height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance. At the time, the Willis Tower held first place in the second and third categories, the Petronas Towers held the first category, and the 1 World Trade Center building held the fourth with its antenna height to top of pinnacle.[12] In 2000, however, a new antenna mast was placed on the Willis Tower, giving it hold of the fourth category. On April 20, 2004, Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, was completed. Its completion gave it the world record for the first three categories. On July 21, 2007 it was announced that Burj Khalifa had surpassed Taipei 101 in height, reaching 512?m (1,680?ft).\\r\\nSince being completed in early 2010, Burj Khalifa leads in all categories (the first building to do so). With a spire height of 829.8?m (2,722?ft), Burj Khalifa surpassed Taipei 101 as the tallest building to architectural detail and the Willis Tower as the tallest building to tip. It also leads in the category of highest occupied floor.\\r\\nBefore Burj Khalifa was completed, Willis Tower led in the fourth category with 527?m (1,729?ft), previously held by the World Trade Center until the extension of the Chicago tower's western broadcast antenna in 2000, over a year prior to the World Trade Center's destruction in 2001. Its antenna mast included, One World Trade Center measured 527.3?m (1,730?ft). The World Trade Center became the world's tallest building to be destroyed or demolished; indeed, its site entered the record books twice on September 11, 2001, in that category, replacing the Singer Building, which once stood a block from the World Trade Center site.[citation needed] A different superlative for skyscrapers is their number of floors. The World Trade Center set that at 110, and this was not surpassed for nearly four decades until the Burj Khalifa, which opened in 2010.\\r\\nStructures such as the CN Tower, the Ostankino Tower and the Oriental Pearl Tower are excluded from these categories because they are not \\"habitable buildings\\", which are defined as frame structures made with floors and walls throughout.[1]\\r\\nFreestanding structures must not be supported by guy wires, the sea or other types of support. It therefore does not include guyed masts, partially guyed towers and drilling platforms but does include towers, skyscrapers (pinnacle height) and chimneys. (See also history of tallest skyscrapers.)\\r\\nThe world's tallest freestanding structure on land is defined as the tallest self-supporting artificial structure that stands above ground. This definition is different from that of world's tallest building or world's tallest structure based on the percentage of the structure that is occupied and whether or not it is self-supporting or supported by exterior cables. Likewise, this definition does not count structures that are built underground or on the seabed, such as the Petronius Platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Visit world's tallest structure by category for a list of various other definitions.\\r\\nThe tallest freestanding structure on land is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The building surpassed the height of the previous record holder, the 553.3?m (1,815?ft) CN Tower in Toronto, Ontario, on September 12, 2007. It was completed in 2010, with final height of 829.8?m (2,722?ft).\\r\\nThe following is a list of structures that have held the title as the tallest freestanding structure on land.\\r\\nNotable mentions include the Pharos (lighthouse) of Alexandria, built in the third century BC and estimated between 115ÿ135?m (377ÿ443?ft). It was the world's tallest non-pyramidal structure for many centuries. Another notable mention includes the Jetavanaramaya stupa in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, which was built in the third century, and was similarly tall at 122?m (400?ft). These were both the world's tallest or second-tallest non-pyramidal structure for over a thousand years.\\r\\nThe tallest secular building between the collapse of the Pharos and the erection of the Washington Monument may have been the Torre del Mangia in Siena, which is 102?m (335?ft) tall, and was constructed in the first half of the fourteenth century, and the 97-metre-tall (318?ft) Torre degli Asinelli in Bologna, also Italy, built between 1109 and 1119.\\r\\nTimeline of development of world's highest observation deck since inauguration of Eiffel Tower.\\r\\nHigher observation decks have existed on mountain tops or cliffs, rather than on tall structures. The Grand Canyon Skywalk, constructed in 2007, protrudes 21?m (70?ft) over the west rim of the Grand Canyon and is approximately 1,100?m (3,600?ft) above the Colorado River, making it the highest of these types of structures.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs most of the tallest structures are guyed masts, here is a timeline of world's tallest guyed masts, since the beginning of radio technology.\\r\\nAs many large guyed masts were destroyed at the end of World War II, the dates for the years between 1945 and 1950 may be incorrect. If Wusung Radio Tower survived World War II, it was the tallest guyed structure shortly after World War II.\\r\\nTowers include observation towers, monuments and other structures not generally considered to be \\"habitable buildings\\", they are meant for \\"regular access by humans, but not for living in or office work, and are self-supporting or freestanding, which means no guy-wires for support\\", meaning it excludes from this list of continuously habitable buildings and skyscrapers as well as radio and TV masts.\\r\\nBridge towers or pylons, chimneys, transmission towers, and most large statues allow human access for maintenance, but not as part of their normal operation, and are therefore not considered to be towers.\\r\\nThe Tokyo Skytree, completed in February 2012, is 634?m (2,080?ft), making it the tallest tower, and second-tallest freestanding structure in the world.[26][27][28]\\r\\nThe following is a list of structures that have historically held the title as the tallest towers in the world.\\r\\nThe list categories are:\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\nSource: Emporis","input":"What is the biggest tower in the world today?"},{"output":"2008ÿ09","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster Rugby (Irish: Rugba Laighean) is one of the four professional provincial rugby teams from the island of Ireland and the most successful Irish team both domestically and in European competition. They compete in the Pro14 and the European Rugby Champions Cup (where their 4th title, achieved in 2018, ties the record for that competition alongside  Toulouse). The team represents the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) Leinster Branch, which is one of four primary branches of the IRFU and is responsible for rugby union throughout the geographical Irish province of Leinster.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster play their home games primarily at the RDS Arena, although larger games are played in the Aviva Stadium when the capacity of the RDS is insufficient.[1] Before moving to the RDS in 2005, Leinster's traditional home ground was Donnybrook Stadium, in Dublin 4. The province plays primarily in blue and the team crest features a harp within a rugby ball, the harp being taken from the flag of Leinster.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster turned professional along with its fellow Irish provinces in 1995 and has competed in the Pro14 (formerly known as the Celtic League and the Pro12) since it was founded in 2001, having previously competed in the annual Irish interprovincial championship.[2] Leinster \\"A\\" competed in the British and Irish Cup. \\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster have five times been Pro14 champions, once European Challenge Cup winners and four times the champions of Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Leinster Branch was inaugurated at a meeting on 31 October 1879. The meeting was held at Lawrence's premises 63 Grafton Street and was largely attended. Although this was the formal founding of Leinster as we know it today, with the amalgamation of the Irish Football Union and the Northern union, the Leinster provincial team had been active since 1875 ÿ when the first interprovincial derby was played against Ulster. The Leinster and Ulster teams also made up the representative Irish team that competed against England in Ireland's first ever international in 1875. Upon the founding of the union, Munster were also added to the fray in 1879, when their first provincial team was selected and first Munster players represented Ireland.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clubs represented at the meeting were; Wanderers, Lansdowne, Arlington School, Dublin University, Dundalk, Phoenix F.C. and Stephen's Hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nF. Kennedy (Wanderers) was elected first Hon. Secretary of the Branch and C.B. Croker (Lansdowne) first Hon. Treasurer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe function of the Branch was to organise the game of rugby football in the province. Every year five representatives would be selected to join the IRFU Committee. They would be known was the \\"Leinster Five\\" and would pick the Leinster representative teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Interprovincial matches between Leinster, Ulster and Munster were held in 1875. At this time the matches were played with 20 players a side. Leinster lost to Ulster by a converted try and beat Munster by one goal to nil. Since then there has been a match between these teams annually, with Connacht joining the fold in 1885.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster Schools Interprovincial matches have been taking place since 1888. Leinster Schools beat the Ulster Schools in Belfast on Saturday 7 April by a dropped goal to a try. Their first match against Munster Schools took place on 18 March 1899, when Leinster won by two tries to one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Leinster Schools Senior Cup, which is one of the biggest annual events in Leinster Rugby commenced in 1887. The competition is still one of the most prestigious competitions to win in Leinster Rugby to date. The first official Leinster Senior Challenge Cup was created in 1881. Once this knock out competition was firmly established, there was a natural demand for a competitive league. Thus the Senior Challenge Cup was followed by the Senior League.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other natural progression was the creation of leagues to follow all cups played at all levels of competition such as the Junior Cup and the Junior League, the Third A Cup (Moran Cup) by the Junior 3 League and so on.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early 1920s led to the creation of the Provincial Towns Cup and the Metropolitan Cup, which are still hard fought competitions in the Leinster Rugby calendar. Much has changed in rugby over the years, but the original idea of Leinster Club Rugby acting as a feeder for the Leinster Interprovincial side, though now professional, still stands true.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Interprovincial matches were abandoned during the years of the Great War (1914ÿ1918) and the War period (1939ÿ1945), though unofficial matches were played.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first major touring side to play Leinster was a team drawn from the New Zealand Army ÿ the Kiwis, in 1946. Although it was not an official touring side organised by the New Zealand Rugby Union, the quality of the match, which was drawn 10 points each, is still remembered to this day.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first official overseas touring side that came to play Leinster was an Australian touring side in 1957.[5] Since then, Leinster has played against every major touring side from Fiji to France.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the days of professional rugby union, there was further emphasis on Irish club rugby as opposed to the provincial game. During these times the provincial sides were purely representative sides and games were far less frequent than now. Between 1946 and 2002 the sides would meet annually to contest the Irish Interprovincial Championship and on rare occasion would be tested against touring international sides. When rugby union was declared 'open' in 1995, these four teams became the four professional teams run by the Irish Rugby Football Union and therefore much of the history of the side has been made in the modern era.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster became a professional outfit in the mid-1990s.\\r\\nThe \\"Leinster Lions\\" name came into existence during the 2001ÿ02 season as the result of a joint marketing initiative between Leinster Rugby and its kit sponsors, the Canterbury Clothing Company. Before the start of the 2004ÿ05 season, the 'Lions' was dropped from the name. It is still used for marketing and branding, in particular the Cubs Club for Junior members of Leinster Rugby.[6] The Leinster mascot is \\"Leo the Lion\\". It was also during this time that the song Molly Malone became a match fixture to be sung by the fans. [7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster's first season in the newly formed Celtic League ended in success as the Lions were crowned the inaugural champions, beating rivals Munster Rugby in the 2001ÿ02 final.[8] In 2002ÿ03, they became only the third team in the history of the European Cup to win all their games in pool play. They also went one step further in the playoffs than the previous season by reaching the semi-finals (for the first time since 1995ÿ96), but lost at home against French side Perpignan, which was accompanied by an unsuccessful season in the Celtic League. The 2003ÿ04 season also ended in disappointment as Leinster slumped to their worst ever league performance and failed to qualify from their European Cup group.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster improved during the 2004ÿ05 season, finishing 3rd, just three points behind the eventual winners, the Ospreys.[9] Leinster also won all of their pool games in that year's European Cup, and were again among the favourites for the title, however they went out at the quarter final stage to Leicester Tigers.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next two seasons of the Celtic League were to end in near misses for Leinster, as they lost out on the 2005ÿ06 and 2006ÿ07 league titles on the final day of the season. These seasons also saw progress in the European Cup. In 2005ÿ06, Leinster progressed to the semi-final but were eliminated by Irish rivals Munster at Lansdowne Road and they reached the quarter-final the following year where they were beaten by eventual winners London Wasps.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreasing attendances at Leinster games led to a move across Dublin 4 from Donnybrook Stadium to the redeveloped RDS Arena.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007ÿ08, Leinster failed to qualify from their European Cup pool, but did end the season as Celtic League champions, sealing the title with a 41ÿ8 victory over the Newport Gwent Dragons in front of their home fans at the RDS.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2008ÿ09 season, Leinster topped their European Cup pool despite away losses to French side Castres and English side Wasps.[12] Victory over Harlequins in the quarter-finals followed, despite the Bloodgate Scandal. Leinster overcame Munster 25ÿ6 in a semi-final in Dublin's Croke Park that broke the world record attendance for a \\"club\\" rugby union game with a crowd of over 82,200.[13] Leinster won the 2009 European Cup Final in Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh, beating Leicester Tigers 19ÿ16 to claim their first European crown.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009ÿ10 Leinster was eliminated from the European Cup at the semi-final stage by eventual winners Toulouse. Also despite having topped the Pro12 league during the regular season, Leinster lost the first ever Play-off Final 17ÿ12 on their home ground to the Ospreys.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2010ÿ11 European Cup, Leinster defeated the top English teams (Leicester Tigers, Saracens & Northampton Saints), as well as top French sides, Toulouse (who were the defending European champions), Racing Metro & Clermont Auvergne, (the French Champions).[16] to go on to regain their title as champions of Europe in the 2011 European Cup Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Trailing at half time, Leinster scored 27 unanswered points in the second half to beat Northampton 33ÿ22 and claim their second European crown with the biggest comeback in European Cup final history.[17][18]\\r\\nLeinster were also chasing a Pro12 & European Cup double, but lost 19ÿ9 to Irish rivals Munster in the Pro12 Final.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011ÿ12 Leinster became only the second side ever to retain the title of European Champions. Leinster emerged unbeaten in group play to top their group[20] and went on to defeat the Cardiff Blues 34ÿ3 in the quarterfinals,[21] followed by a 19ÿ15 semifinal victory over ASM Clermont Auvergne.[22] and defeated Ulster in the first all-Irish final 42ÿ14, recording the most points scored and the most tries scored in a European Cup final as well as becoming the first unbeaten side to win the European Cup.[23]\\r\\nOnce again, Leinster targeted the double, and faced a repeat of the 2010 Pro12 final against the Ospreys. Leinster's domestic title challenge fell at the final hurdle, conceding a final minute try to slump to a one-point defeat, and unable to complete the double despite topping the table in the regular season.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2012ÿ13 campaign proved to be another successful season for Leinster Rugby.  The club finished in second place during the regular season of the Pro12 and defeated Glasgow Warriors by a score of 17ÿ15 in their semi-final play-off match on 11 May 2013.[25] On 17 May, Leinster were crowned champions of the European Challenge Cup after defeating Stade Fran?ais 34ÿ13 in the final at their home ground, the RDS Arena.[26] Leinster successfully completed the double on 25 May, defeating Ulster 24ÿ18 in the Pro12 final to claim their third league championship.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster continued their success in the 2013ÿ14 season by becoming the first team ever to defend the Pro12 title, topping the league in the regular season and defeating Glasgow Warriors 34ÿ12 in their fifth consecutive Pro12 play-off final and also secured their seventh major title in as many years.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a remarkable run of seven major trophies in seven years, Leinsters title run came to an end following the 2013-14 season. The 2014ÿ15 season saw a dip in form, with Leinster finishing in fifth place in the league and failing to make the play-offs. Fortunes in the newly formed Champions Cup were better, with the team reaching the semi-final where they were defeated in extra-time by eventual winners, Toulon.

The new, stylised crest, is made specific to Leinster Rugby as it incorporates the harp with a rugby ball.[32] The Leinster Rugby crest is on all official club merchandise including replica jerseys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe province's current kit is blue with a white harp and 12 navy lines, which represent the 12 counties of Leinster, while the second kit is white with a blue harp and 12 blue lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Leinster jersey also features three stars above the crest, to represent the three European Cup titles won prior to the fourth win in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster's current home ground is the RDS Arena.[33] Games were first played at the RDS during the 2005ÿ06 season, initially just for European Cup games. By the following season however, all games had been moved to the RDS. The RDS has undergone large scale redevelopment since Leinster moved in. The arena now has a mostly seated capacity of 18,500. As the RDS remains a showjumping venue, the North and South stands are removable. A roof has been constructed to cover the grandstand opposite the pre-existing Anglesea stand.[34] The RDS will be Leinster's home until 2027, as a 20-year lease was signed in 2007.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2014, it was announced by the RDS and Leinster rugby that a design competition was being held to develop the arena into a 25,000 capacity world class stadium, with work expected to commence on the redevelopment in April 2016.[36] The selling of naming rights to the arena will be a key component in funding the project, with an initial budget of ?20,000,000 being proposed.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor bigger games where the RDS does not have sufficient capacity, Leinster play their games at the Aviva Stadium, which has an all-seater capacity of 51,700. These are often key home games in the European Cup or Pro14 games against domestic rivals. In 2010 they first played a home league game against Munster, the first time the stadium sold out,[38] and then against ASM Clermont Auvergne.[39][40][41] Leinster defeated Leicester Tigers at the venue in the 2010ÿ11 European Cup quarter-finals and went on to beat Toulouse in the semi-finals, also held at the Aviva stadium on 30 April 2011, en route to winning their second European Cup.[42] The following season Leinster hosted Munster, Bath and Cardiff at the Aviva Stadium and remained unbeaten at the ground until December 2012 when they lost 21ÿ28 to ASM Clermont Auvergne.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster's traditional home over the years has been Donnybrook Stadium in Donnybrook, Dublin 4. Donnybrook consists of a single covered stand and three sides of open terracing. A move across Dublin 4 to the RDS Arena for Leinster was needed to accommodate growing crowds, as the 6,000 capacity stadium had become too small.[43] For this reason, Leinster have signed a long term lease with the Royal Dublin Society to play home games at the RDS Arena. Donnybrook has since, been improved as a venue with the reconstruction of the grandstand in 2008[44] and remains an important venue for rugby union in Dublin.[5] Due to limited space, it is unlikely that Donnybrook will undergo further redevelopment. Leinster A play their British and Irish Cup games in the stadium and the senior team have continued to hold certain pre-season friendlies in the stadium as well as most Leinster schools cup matches being held at the venue.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the advent of professionalism in the Irish game, provincial rugby games were generally poorly attended. During most of the 1990s, Leinster matches regularly attracted crowds of about 500 to 2,000.[47] The decision to structure the game professionally via the provincial network through centralised player contracts and the subsequent on-field success achieved by Leinster and the other provinces resulted in a significant increase in support within a decade.[47] Leinster had 3,700 season ticket holders in 2006, double the amount of the previous season.[47] Leinster's supporters were named as 'Player of the Month' for April 2009 following their support in the European Cup Quarter Final against Harlequins at The Stoop.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster have the best support of any club in the PRO12 league and had an average attendance of 17,717 in the 2014ÿ15 Pro12 season.[49] Leinster currently have roughly 12,500 season ticket holders.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster hold the record for the biggest Pro12 attendance. On 2 October 2010, Leinster played Munster in the 5th round of the league at the Aviva Stadium, this set a new crowd attendance record for a Pro12 game at 50,645. Leinster won the match 13ÿ9.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last match at the old Landsdowne Road stadium was against Ulster on 31 December 2006 before it was demolished to make way for the new Aviva Stadium, earning the match the moniker of \\"The Last Stand\\". Leinster won the match 20ÿ12, with an attendance of 48,000 ÿ a record at the time.[52] A previous attendance record in the Pro12 was also set at Lansdowne Road, for a game between Leinster and Munster which drew a crowd of 30,000.[53] Leinsters European Cup clash against Munster at Croke Park set a world record attendance for a \\"club\\" rugby union game with a crowd of 82,208.[54] The Official Leinster Supporters Club was formally established as a club in 2007.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLeinster A is the team that represents Leinster in the British & Irish Cup,[56] having won the competition a record two times to date, in the 2012ÿ13 season as well as the 2013ÿ14 season, also becoming the first and only side to ever successfully defend the trophy. Leinster A also compete in the All Ireland Inter-provincial Championship.  Pre-professionalism and a formal Celtic league structure, the main Leinster team competed in the AIIPC. Since the advent of professionalism the provinces have fielded lesser teams to concentrate on the Celtic League.  The team is composed of Senior Leinster squad players requiring gametime, Development contract & Academy players and, occasionally, AIL players called up from their clubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the start of the 2015ÿ16 season, Leinster A is coached by Hugh Hogan (Head Coach) and Shaun Berne (Asst Coach).\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 2007ÿ08 season to the 2017-18 season Leinster's kits were supplied by Canterbury of New Zealand but for the next five seasons starting with the 2018 -19 season Leinsters kits will be supplied by Adidas. Bank of Ireland, the country's oldest banking institution are Leinster's primary sponsors appearing in the front of their shirt, their sleeves, the top back of their shirt and the front right of their shorts. The Bank of Ireland symbol appeared on Leinster's front right and front left collars. On occasion the team will wear a shirt adorned with the logo of another sponsor due to a promotion run annually by the bank offering up the sponsorship space to an Irish business by way of a competition to win the right to become sponsor for a day.[57] During the 2013ÿ14 season the contest was won by Dublin-based meat wholesaler Gahan Meats[58] and for 2014ÿ15 the shirt sponsorship winners were accounting software provider Big Red Cloud.[59] The sponsorship prize package is valued at ?50,000 and attracts hundreds of companies keen to be shortlisted each year.[60] The left of Leinster's back shorts had Bank of Ireland between 2009 and 2013 where it was replaced by Bank of Ireland's Twitter address right up until 2015 where it was replaced by Laya Healthcare. The teams 'official airline' is Irelands' CityJet. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Leinster senior squad is:[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Flags indicate national union as has been defined under WR eligibility rules.

Similarly Leinster enjoy a 23ÿ8 win:loss ratio against western province Connacht. Leinster hold only a narrow head-to-head lead against arch-rivals Munster in one of the most intense derbies in world rugby, where they possess a 22ÿ15 advantage. Munster are the closest Pro12 team to having a positive record against Leinster - all of the league's other sides have substantial losing records against Leinster. The Welsh side Celtic Warriors existed in the league for its first couple of seasons and have a positive record against Leinster of two wins and zero defeats, but the sides only ever played a couple of matches head-to-head before Celtic Warriors and a number of other Welsh clubs went out of business or merged. This was also at a time when Leinster were nowhere near as strong as they are now.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn European terms, out of teams who have played at least three games against Leinster, only a few enjoy a winning record. Stade Toulousain (Toulouse) have a slim 5ÿ4 advantage after nine matches between the two teams. Stade Francais lead Leinster 3ÿ2, while RC Toulon have a commanding 4ÿ0 head-to-head lead. These are the only European clubs who have played against Leinster at least three times who have a winning record against them. Unless a negligible number of matches has been played no English, Irish, Welsh, Scottish or Italian clubs lead Leinster in head-to-head terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also Category:Leinster Rugby players.

Between 10:05 and 10:15?p.m. PDT, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, fired more than 1,100 rounds from his suite on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel. About an hour after Paddock fired his last shot into the crowd of 22,000, he was found dead in his room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His motive is unknown.\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States. The shooting reignited the debate about gun laws in the U.S., with attention focused on bump fire stocks, which Paddock used to allow his semi-automatic rifles to fire at a rate similar to that of a fully automatic weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Strip is a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard in Clark County, Nevada, immediately south of the City of Las Vegas. The Strip is known for its concentration of casinos and resort hotels, including the 43-story Mandalay Bay southwest of its intersection with Mandalay Bay Road, in the unincorporated town of Paradise.[2]\\r\\nLas Vegas Village is located diagonally across the intersection to the northeast; the 15-acre (6.1-hectare) lot is used for outdoor performances.[2][3] The annual Route 91 Harvest country music festival has been held there since 2014; the 2017 festival ran from September 29 to October 1.[3][a]\\r\\nPaddock may have considered attacking other outdoor concerts. He reserved a room that overlooked the August 2017 Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, but did not use it. He appears to have stayed in Downtown Las Vegas from September 14 until the night of the shooting. Between September 22 and 24, he rented rooms at The Ogden, which overlooked the open-air Life Is Beautiful festival.[4]\\r\\nPaddock arrived at the Mandalay Bay on September 25, 2017, and he was booked into a complimentary room because he was a frequent gambler at the casino.[5] Three days later, he moved to the 32nd floor suite, which overlooks Las Vegas Village.[6][b] He placed a \\"Do not disturb\\" sign on the door, organized the room, and stockpiled an arsenal of weapons.[7][8] Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Paddock carried more than ten suitcases into his hotel suite during his preparation for the shooting.[7]\\r\\nTwenty-three firearms, a large quantity of ammunition, and numerous high-capacity magazines capable of holding up to 100 rounds apiece were found in the suite.[9][10] The firearms included four DDM4 rifles, three FN-15 rifles, one AR-15 rifle with forward front grip, one .308-caliber AR-10 rifle, one Kalashnikov, and at least one made-to-order LMT rifle and one handgun.[11][12][13] Two of the rifles were equipped with telescopic sights and mounted on bipods.[14][15] Twelve of the guns were fitted with bump fire stocks,[11] which allowed for recoil to actuate their triggers at a rate of 90 rounds in 10 seconds.[16] The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that the firearms found in his hotel room, along with more guns found in his homes, had been legally purchased in the states of Nevada, California, Texas, and Utah.[17] In the month preceding the shooting, he had attempted to purchase a large quantity of tracer ammunition, but the gun dealer he approached did not have the item in stock.[18]\\r\\nInvestigators found hidden surveillance cameras that were placed inside and outside the hotel room, presumably so Paddock could monitor the arrival of others.[19] The cameras were not in record mode.[20] Police said a handwritten note found in the room indicated Paddock had been calculating the distance, wind, and trajectory from his 32nd floor hotel suite to the concertgoers he was targeting on the festival lot.[21][22]\\r\\nAt a press conference on October 4, Sheriff Lombardo stated there was evidencewhich he declined to discussthat Paddock intended to escape the scene, and that he may have had assistance from an accomplice.[23] Investigators searched Paddock's room and found a \\"bulletproof vest\\" and breathing apparatus, which were survival gear that Paddock never used.[24]\\r\\nDuring subsequent investigations, ammonium nitrate (often used in improvised explosive devices) was found in the trunk of his Hyundai Tucson SUV, along with 1,600 rounds of ammunition and 50 pounds (23?kg) of Tannerite, a binary explosive used to make explosive targets for gun ranges.[25][26] Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said that while Paddock had \\"nefarious intent\\" with the material, he did not appear to have assembled an explosive device.[18][27]\\r\\nThe mass shooting occurred between 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. PDT on October 1, 2017 (the third and final night of the festival). When the shooting began, country music singer Jason Aldean was giving the closing performance in front of an audience of about 22,000.[28]\\r\\nShortly before 10:00?p.m., hotel security guard Jesus Campos was sent to the 32nd floor to investigate an open-door alert. He encountered a barricaded door that prevented him from immediately accessing the floor. After arriving on the floor, he heard drilling coming from Room 32135, which was Paddock's suite, and went to investigate. At approximately 10:05, he was hit in the right thigh by one of about 200 bullets that Paddock fired through the door of his suite. After Campos was hit, he immediately informed the hotel by radio and cellphone that he had been shot. At the same time, maintenance worker Stephen Schuck was on the same floor to check out the report of a jammed fire door. Campos, who was already injured, encountered Schuck and told him to take cover. Schuck contacted hotel dispatchers over his radio, informed them of the ongoing shooting, and told them to call the police.[29][30][31][32] Neither Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department nor MGM Resorts International, the Mandalay Bay's owner, have confirmed when information about the initial shooting was relayed to the police.[33][34][35][36]\\r\\nPaddock used a hammer to break two of his suite's windows and began shooting through them at 10:05?p.m.,[37] ultimately firing more than 1,100 rifle rounds[38] approximately 490 yards (450?m) into the festival audience.[39][40][41][c] Many people in the crowd initially mistook the gunfire for fireworks.[42] During the shooting, a security fence hindered concertgoers from fleeing the 15-acre concrete lot.[43] The gunfire continued, with some momentary pauses, over the span of ten minutes and ended by 10:15?p.m.[44][45]\\r\\nTwo of the bullets fired by Paddock struck a large jet fuel tank at McCarran International Airport 2,000 feet (600?m) away. One of the bullets penetrated the tank, but the fuel did not ignite or explode because there was a very low probability that a bullet could ignite it.[46]\\r\\nDuring the shooting, police officers were initially confused whether the shots were coming from the Mandalay Bay, the nearby Luxor hotel, or the festival grounds.[43] There were also multiple false reports of additional shooters at other hotels on the Strip.[47] Officers eventually spotted multiple flashes of gunfire in the middle of the northern side of Mandalay Bay and responded to the hotel. At 10:12?p.m., two officers on the 31st floor reported the sounds of gunfire on the floor above them.[43] When officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17?p.m. and encountered Campos a minute later, he directed them to Paddock's room and helped others evacuate. Campos was then directed to seek medical attention for himself.[30][32]\\r\\nBetween 10:26 and 10:30?p.m., an additional eight officers arrived at the 32nd floor. The gunfire had ceased, and the police moved systematically down the hallway, searching and clearing each room, using a master key that was provided by Campos. At 10:55?p.m., the officers finished evacuating guests. At 11:20?p.m., police breached Paddock's room with explosives.[45][43][48] Paddock was found dead on the floor from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.[49][50] While entering the hotel suite, an officer accidentally fired one round from his weapon, but the bullet did not hit anyone.[51] At 11:27?p.m., officers announced over the police radio that one suspect was down.[45][52] Early on October 2, Sheriff Lombardo identified the suspect as Stephen Paddock.[53]\\r\\nThere have been several changes in the official account and timeline of Paddock's shooting of hotel security guard Campos. Police officials described these adjustments as \\"minute changes\\" that are common in complex investigations.[30]\\r\\nIn their first statement about the incident, police officials inaccurately reported that Campos arrived on the scene after Paddock began firing into the crowd. In a second statement, police officials reported, again inaccurately, that Campos was shot six minutes before Paddock began firing into the crowd. That report had been based on a 9:59?p.m. notation in a hotel security log, which in a third statement was determined to have been the time when Campos encountered the barricaded door.[29][31]\\r\\nSheriff Lombardo dismissed allegations that the changing timeline was the result of some kind of conspiracy between the police department, the FBI, and MGM Resorts International saying, \\"Nobody is attempting to hide anything in reference to this investigation. The dynamics and the size of this investigation requires us to go through voluminous amounts of information in order to draw an accurate picture.\\"[29]\\r\\nA total of 58 people (excluding Paddock) lost their lives as a result of the shooting.[54][55][56] The fatalities included 36 women and 22 men.[54] The oldest was 67, the youngest 20.[57] Six were from Nevada, 35 from California, 13 from other states, and four from Canada. [58] The Clark County Coroner's office determined that all 58 victims died as a result of gunshot wounds.[59] An additional 546 people were injured.[35] In the aftermath, many victims were transported to area hospitals, which included University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center, and at least one of the six hospitals of Valley Health System.[60][61][62] Sunrise Hospital treated the largest portion of the wounded: 199 patients,[63] 150 of whom arrived within a timespan of about 40 minutes.[64] For reasons that are unclear, most patients were transported to Sunrise, a Level II trauma center. University Medical Center, a nearby Level I trauma center, treated 104 patients.[65] Six victims sought medical treatment in Southern California; UC Irvine Medical Center treated four and Loma Linda University Medical Center treated two.[66]\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States, surpassing the death toll of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, where 49 died, excluding the gunman.[54][67][68]\\r\\nStephen Paddock (April 9, 1953?ÿ October 1, 2017)[69] was a former auditor and real estate businessman,[70] who had been living in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada, which is 82 miles from the shooting scene.[71] Paddock was a high-stakes gambler who placed bets at a high enough level to earn valuable compsfree benefits such as rooms and meals. He was a familiar figure to casino hosts in Las Vegas, but was not well known among other high-stakes gamblers because he mostly played video poker.[5] He reportedly kept to himself and was a heavy drinker.[72] Police said he had made casino transactions in the tens of thousands of dollars prior to the shooting, but did not specify whether these transactions were losses or wins.[73] Sheriff Lombardo said Paddock had lost a significant amount of his wealth over the previous two years, which might have been a \\"determining factor\\" in the attack, but added that his motive may never truly be understood.[74]\\r\\nCourt records show that Paddock was twice divorced. He was single at the time of the shooting. He had no known children.[75] Paddock was the son of Benjamin Paddock, a bank robber who was on the FBI's most-wanted list between 1969 and 1977, whose wanted poster stated that he was \\"diagnosed as psychopathic\\" and \\"reportedly has suicidal tendencies\\".[76]\\r\\nPolice believe Paddock acted alone and have not determined his motive, despite following more than a thousand leads.[50][18][77] His younger brother and others who were in close contact with him described him as having no apparent religious or political affiliation.[75] Police said they had no investigative information or criminal history indicating that he was dangerous. His only recorded interaction with law enforcement was a minor traffic citation that he settled in court years before the shooting.[78][79]\\r\\nMuch of Las Vegas Boulevard was closed while police SWAT teams combed the venue and neighboring businesses. McCarran International Airport, adjacent to the shooting site, was shut down for several hours.[80] Approximately 300 people entered the airport property as they fled to safety from the shooting.[42] This prompted officials to shut down all four runways. More than 25 flights were rerouted to ensure that no aircraft would be hit by gunfire,[47] while other flights were canceled before airfield operations resumed at 12:40?a.m. on October 2.[81] At approximately 2:45?p.m. PDT on October 2, a state of emergency was declared in Clark County.[82][83]\\r\\nOn the morning after the shooting, lines to donate blood in Las Vegas stretched for blocks. Wait times were as much as six hours or more.[84] Millions of dollars have also been raised to help victims and their families.[85]\\r\\nNevada Governor Brian Sandoval called the shooting \\"a tragic and heinous act of violence that has shaken the Nevada family\\".[86] Jason Aldean, who was singing when the shooting started, posted his condolences on Instagram and noted all of those working with him at the show had survived the attack.[87]\\r\\nAt a press conference, President Donald Trump described Paddock as \\"a very very sick individual\\", and \\"a demented man, [with] a lot of problems\\". He added, \\"the police department has done such an incredible job, and we'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by\\".[88][89] A White House official talking points memo, distributed to Trump allies, opposed tightening gun control since \\"new laws won't stop a mad man\\", but \\"will curtail the freedoms of law abiding citizens\\".[90] On October 2, Trump issued a proclamation to honor the victims and their families.[91][92] On October 4, Trump visited the shooting victims and first responders.[93] On October 7, Vice President Mike Pence participated in a unity prayer walk and ceremony in Las Vegas in honor of the dead.[94]\\r\\nStock prices of firearms manufacturers rose the day after the shooting, as has happened after similar incidents. Investors expect gun sales will increase over concerns that such an event could lead to more stringent gun-control legislation and a rush of customers wishing to defend themselves against future attacks.[95][96]\\r\\nAccording to authorities with the Clark County Commissioner, the name \\"1 October\\" was declared the official title for investigations into the mass shooting.[97] The future of the Las Vegas Village site remains undetermined.[98]\\r\\nThe shooting prompted support in the U.S. Congress for assault weapons legislation that would ban bump fire stocks. The National Rifle Association (NRA) came out in favor of administrative bump fire stock regulations.[54] Many Congressional Democrats and some Republicans expressed their support of a prohibition of bump fire stocks.[99] Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a Senate bill that gained 39 Democratic co-sponsors. Two bipartisan bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives. As of November, no Congressional action has been taken. House leaders said the issue of bump fire stock regulation should be decided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which originally approved gun-stocks.[100] On November 6, Massachusetts became the first state to ban the sale, possession, or use of the devices.[101]\\r\\nNine days after the shooting, eighteen Democratic U.S. Senators introduced a bill, the Keep Americans Safe Act, which, if signed into law, would ban gun magazines that hold more than ten rounds of ammunition.[102]\\r\\nThe annual Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Marathon took place on November 12 and was the largest event to be held in the city since the shooting. The event received a massive amount of security, which included 350 officers, counter-sniper surveillance posts, and a number of barriers composed of dump trucks, buses, and other large vehicles.[103]\\r\\nSurvivors of the shooting have received death threats on social media; they have also been accused of being paid actors.[104]\\r\\nIn the hours after the shooting and during the succeeding days, false information and fake news about the shooter's identity and motive went viral on social media:\\r\\nGoogle and Facebook were criticized for displaying such false news stories in some of their search results.[112][119][120] The two technology companies were said to have failed in their responsibility of keeping false stories from reaching the public.[121] Facebook later said its algorithms were designed to detect and remove false stories, but failed to work adequately in this instance.[119]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, some media outlets reported that YouTube search results for information about the shooting returned links to conspiracy videos. YouTube stated that it had tweaked its search algorithm to promote news sources which it considered more authoritative.[122][123]","input":"When did the mass shooting in las vegas occur?"},{"output":"Jiroemon Kimura (1897ÿ2013) of Japan","context":"This is a list of the 100 verified oldest men, arranged in descending order of each individual's age in years and days.

Deployed on Strategic Air Command bombers, the B53, with a yield of 9 megatons, was the most powerful weapon in the U.S. nuclear arsenal after the last B41 nuclear bombs were retired in 1976.\\r\\nThe B53 was the basis of the W-53 warhead carried by the Titan II Missile, which was decommissioned in 1987. Although not in active service for many years before 2010, fifty B53s were retained during that time as part of the \\"hedge\\" portion[3] of the Enduring Stockpile until its complete dismantling in 2011. The last B53 was disassembled on 25 October 2011, a year ahead of schedule.[4][5]\\r\\nWith its retirement, the largest bomb currently in service in the U.S. nuclear arsenal is the B83, with a maximum yield of 1.2 megatons.[6] The B53 was replaced in the bunker-busting role by a variant of the two-stage B61 nuclear bomb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopment of the weapon began in 1955 by Los Alamos National Laboratory, based on the earlier Mk 21 and Mk 46 weapons. In March 1958 the Strategic Air Command issued a request for a new Class C (less than five tons, megaton-range) bomb to replace the earlier Mk 41.[2] A revised version of the Mk 46 became the TX-53 in 1959. The development TX-53 warhead was apparently never tested, although an experimental TX-46 predecessor design was detonated 28 June 1958 as Hardtack Oak, which detonated at a yield of 8.9 Megatons.\\r\\nThe Mk 53 entered production in 1962 and was built through June 1965.[2] About 340 bombs were built. It entered service aboard B-47 Stratojet, B-52G Stratofortress,[1] and B-58 Hustler bomber aircraft in the mid-1960s. From 1968 it was redesignated B53.\\r\\nSome early versions of the bomb were dismantled beginning in 1967. About 50 bomb and 54 Titan warhead versions were in service through 1980. After the Titan II program ended, the remaining W-53s were retired in the late 1980s. The B53 was also intended to be retired in the 1980s, but 50 units remained in the active stockpile until the deployment of the B61-11 in 1997. At that point the obsolete B53s were slated for immediate disassembly; however, the process of disassembling the units was greatly hampered by safety concerns as well as a lack of resources.[7] In 2010 authorization was given to disassemble the 50 bombs at the Pantex plant in Texas.[8] The process of dismantling the last remaining B53 bomb in the stockpile was completed in 2011.[9][10]\\r\\nThe B53 was 12?feet 4?inches (3.76?m) long with a diameter of 50 inches (4.17?ft; 1.27?m). It weighed 8,850 pounds (4,010?kg), including the W53 warhead, the 800-to-900?lb (360-to-410?kg) parachute system and the honeycomb aluminum nose cone to enable the bomb to survive laydown delivery. It had five parachutes:[1] one 5-foot (1.52?m) pilot chute, one 16-foot (4.88?m) extractor chute, and three 48-foot (14.63?m) main chutes. Chute deployment depends on delivery mode, with the main chutes used only for laydown delivery. For free-fall delivery, the entire system was jettisoned.\\r\\nThe W53 warhead of the B53 used oralloy (highly enriched uranium) instead of plutonium for fission, with a mix of lithium-6 deuteride fuel for fusion. The explosive lens comprised a mixture of RDX and TNT, which was not insensitive. Two variants were made: the B53-Y1, a \\"dirty\\" weapon using a U-238-encased secondary, and the B53-Y2 \\"clean\\" version with a non-fissile (lead or tungsten) secondary casing. Explosive yield was approximately nine megatons.\\r\\nIt was intended as a bunker buster weapon, using a surface blast after laydown deployment to transmit a shock wave through the earth to collapse its target. Attacks against the Soviet deep underground leadership shelters in the Chekhov/Sharapovo area south of Moscow envisaged multiple B53/W53 exploding at ground level. It has since been supplanted in such roles by the earth-penetrating B61 Mod 11, a bomb that penetrates the surface to deliver much more of its explosive energy into the ground, and therefore needs a much smaller yield to produce the same effects.\\r\\nThe B53 was intended to be retired in the 1980s, but 50 units remained in the active stockpile until the deployment of the B61-11 in 1997. At that point the obsolete B53s were slated for immediate disassembly; however, the process of disassembling the units was greatly hampered by safety concerns as well as a lack of resources.[7][8] The last remaining B53 bomb began the disassembly processes on Tuesday, 25 October 2011 at the Energy Departments Pantex Plant.[5]\\r\\nAn April 2014 GAO report notes that the NNSA is retaining canned subassemblies (CSAs) \\" associated with a certain warhead indicated as excess in the 2012 Production and Planning Directive are being retained in an indeterminate state pending a senior-level government evaluation of their use in planetary defense against earthbound asteroids.\\"[11] In its FY2015 budget request, the NNSA noted that the B53 component disassembly was \\"delayed\\", leading some observers to conclude they might be the warhead CSAs being retained for potential planetary defense purposes.[12]\\r\\nThe W53 warhead of the Titan II ICBM used the same physics package as the B53, without the air drop-specific components like the parachute system and crushable structures in the nose and sides needed for lay-down delivery, reducing its mass to about 6,200?lb (2,800?kg).[13] The 8,140-pound (3,690?kg) Mark-6 re-entry vehicle containing the W53 warhead was about 123 inches (10.3?ft; 3.1?m) long, 7.5 feet (2.3?m) in diameter and was mounted atop a spacer which was 8.3 feet (2.5?m) in diameter at the missile interface (compared to the missile's core diameter of 10 feet [3.0?m]). With a yield of 9 megatons, it was the highest yield warhead ever deployed on a US missile. About 65 W53 warheads were constructed between December 1962 and December 1963.[13]\\r\\nOn 19 September 1980 a fuel leak caused a Titan II to explode within its silo in Arkansas, throwing the W53 warhead some distance away. Due to the safety measures built into the weapon, it did not explode or release any radioactive material.[14] 52 active missiles were deployed in silos prior to the beginning of the retirement program in October 1982.[13] With the retirement of the Titan fleet, disassembly of the W53 warheads was completed by about 1988.[citation needed]\\r\\nAssuming a detonation at optimum height, a 9 megaton blast would result in a fireball with an approximate 2.9 to 3.4?mi (4.7 to 5.5?km) diameter.[15] The radiated heat would be sufficient to cause lethal burns to any unprotected person within a 20-mile (32?km) radius (1,250?sq?mi or 3,200?km2). Blast effects would be sufficient to collapse most residential and industrial structures within a 9?mi (14?km) radius (254?sq?mi or 660?km2); within 3.65?mi (5.87?km) (42?sq?mi or 110?km2) virtually all above-ground structures would be destroyed and blast effects would inflict near 100% fatalities. Within 2.25?mi (3.62?km) a 500 rem dose of ionizing radiation would be received by the average person, sufficient to cause a 50% to 90% casualty rate independent of thermal or blast effects at this distance.[16]","input":"What is the largest nuclear bomb america has?"},{"output":"12 May 2010","context":"The Department for Education (DfE) is a department of Her Majesty's Government responsible for child protection, education (compulsory, further and higher education), apprenticeships and wider skills in England.

For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.\\r\\nEarly television remote controls (1956-1977) used ultrasonic tones. Present-day remote controls are commonly consumer infrared devices which send digitally-coded pulses of infrared radiation to control functions such as power, volume, tuning, temperature set point, fan speed, or other features. Remote controls for these devices are usually small wireless handheld objects with an array of buttons for adjusting various settings such as television channel, track number, and volume. For many devices, the remote control contains all the function controls while the controlled device itself has only a handful of essential primary controls. The remote control code, and thus the required remote control device, is usually specific to a product line, but there are universal remotes, which emulate the remote control made for most major brand devices.\\r\\nRemote control has continually evolved and advanced in the 2000s to include Bluetooth connectivity, motion sensor-enabled capabilities and voice control.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1894, the first example of wirelessly controlling at a distance was during a demonstration by the British physicist Oliver Lodge, in which he made use of a Branly's coherer to make a mirror galvanometer move a beam of light when an electromagnetic wave was artificially generated. This was further refined by radio innovators Guglielmo Marconi and William Preece, at a demonstration that took place on December 12, 1896, at Toynbee Hall in London, in which they made a bell ring by pushing a button in a box that was not connected by any wires.[3] In 1898 Nikola Tesla filed his patent, U.S. Patent 613,809, named Method of an Apparatus for Controlling Mechanism of Moving Vehicle or Vehicles, which he publicly demonstrated by radio-controlling a boat during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. Tesla called his boat a \\"teleautomaton\\".[4]\\r\\nIn 1903, Leonardo Torres Quevedo presented the Telekino at the Paris Academy of Science, accompanied by a brief, and making an experimental demonstration. In the same time he obtained a patent in France, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States. The Telekino consisted of a robot that executed commands transmitted by electromagnetic waves. With the Telekino, Torres-Quevedo laid down modern wireless remote-control operation principles[5] and was a pioneer in the field of remote control. In 1906, in the presence of the king and before a great crowd, Torres successfully demonstrated the invention in the port of Bilbao, guiding a boat from the shore. Later, he would try to apply the Telekino to projectiles and torpedoes, but had to abandon the project for lack of financing. The first remote-controlled model aeroplane flew in 1932, and the use of remote control technology for military purposes was worked intensively during the Second World War, one result of this being the German Wasserfall missile.\\r\\nBy the late 1930s, several radio manufacturers offered remote controls for some of their higher-end models.[6] Most of these were connected to the set being controlled by wires, but the Philco Mystery Control (1939) was a battery-operated low-frequency radio transmitter,[7] thus making it the first wireless remote control for a consumer electronics device. Using pulse-count modulation, this also was the first digital wireless remote control.\\r\\nThe first remote intended to control a television was developed by Zenith Radio Corporation in 1950. The remote, called \\"Lazy Bones\\", was connected to the television by a wire. A wireless remote control, the \\"Flashmatic\\", was developed in 1955 by Eugene Polley. It worked by shining a beam of light onto a photoelectric cell, but the cell did not distinguish between light from the remote and light from other sources. The Flashmatic also had to be pointed very precisely at the receiver in order to work.[8]\\r\\nIn 1956, Robert Adler developed \\"Zenith Space Command\\", a wireless remote.[9] It was mechanical and used ultrasound to change the channel and volume. When the user pushed a button on the remote control, it clicked and struck a bar, hence the term \\"clicker\\". Each bar emitted a different frequency and circuits in the television detected this sound. The invention of the transistor made possible cheaper electronic remotes that contained a piezoelectric crystal that was fed by an oscillating electric current at a frequency near or above the upper threshold of human hearing, though still audible to dogs. The receiver contained a microphone attached to a circuit that was tuned to the same frequency. Some problems with this method were that the receiver could be triggered accidentally by naturally occurring noises, and some people could hear the piercing ultrasonic signals.\\r\\nThe impetus for a more complex type of television remote control came in 1973, with the development of the Ceefax teletext service by the BBC. Most commercial remote controls at that time had a limited number of functions, sometimes as few as three: next channel, previous channel, and volume/off. This type of control did not meet the needs of teletext sets, where pages were identified with three-digit numbers. A remote control to select teletext pages would need buttons for each numeral from zero to nine, as well as other control functions, such as switching from text to picture, and the normal television controls of volume, channel, brightness, colour intensity, etc. Early teletext sets used wired remote controls to select pages, but the continuous use of the remote control required for teletext quickly indicated the need for a wireless device. So BBC engineers began talks with one or two television manufacturers, which led to early prototypes in around 1977ÿ1978 that could control many more functions. ITT was one of the companies and later gave its name to the ITT protocol of infrared communication.[10]\\r\\nIn 1980, a Canadian company, Viewstar, Inc., was formed by engineer Paul Hrivnak and started producing a cable TV converter with an infrared remote control. The product was sold through Philips for approximately $190 CAD. At the time the most popular remote control was the Starcom of Jerrold (a division of General Instruments) which used 40-kHz sound to change channels. The Viewstar converter was an immediate success, the millionth converter being sold on March 21, 1985, with 1.6 million sold by 1989.[11]\\r\\nThe Blab-off was a wired remote control created in 1952 that turned a TV's sound on or off so that viewers could avoid hearing commercials.[12] In the 1980s Steve Wozniak of Apple started a company named CL 9. The purpose of this company was to create a remote control that could operate multiple electronic devices. The CORE unit (Controller Of Remote Equipment) was introduced in the fall of 1987. The advantage to this remote controller was that it could \\"learn\\" remote signals from different devices. It had the ability to perform specific or multiple functions at various times with its built-in clock. It was the first remote control that could be linked to a computer and loaded with updated software code as needed. The CORE unit never made a huge impact on the market. It was much too cumbersome for the average user to program, but it received rave reviews from those who could.[citation needed] These obstacles eventually led to the demise of CL 9, but two of its employees continued the business under the name Celadon. This was one of the first computer-controlled learning remote controls on the market.[13]\\r\\nIn 2006, Hillcrest Labs introduced the Loop pointer, a remote control that used Hillcrest's Freespace motion control technology to allow users to control their televisions with natural gestures. The Loop had just four buttons and a scroll wheel.[14][15][16][17] Freespace-enabled remote controls use radio waves to communicate with a USB antenna connected to a computer that is also connected to the television, so they do not need to be pointed at the PC, or even have a direct line of sight.[18][19][20]\\r\\nIn the 2010s, cars are increasingly sold with electronic remote control door locks. These remotes transmit a signal to the car which locks or unlocks the door locks or unlocks the trunk. An aftermarket device sold in some countries is the remote starter. This enables a car owner to remotely start their car. This feature is most associated with countries with winter climates, where users may wish to run the car for several minutes before they intend to use it, so that the car heater and defrost systems can remove ice and snow from the windows.\\r\\nBy the early 2000s, the number of consumer electronic devices in most homes greatly increased, along with the number of remotes to control those devices. According to the Consumer Electronics Association, an average US home has four remotes.[citation needed] To operate a home theater as many as five or six remotes may be required, including one for cable or satellite receiver, VCR or digital video recorder (DVR/PVR), DVD player, TV and audio amplifier. Several of these remotes may need to be used sequentially for some programs or services to work properly. However, as there are no accepted interface guidelines, the process is increasingly cumbersome. One solution used to reduce the number of remotes that have to be used is the universal remote, a remote control which is programmed with the operation codes for most major brands of TVs, DVD players, etc. In the early 2010s, many smartphone manufacturers began incorporating infrared emitters into their devices, thereby enabling their use as universal remotes via an included or downloadable app.[21]\\r\\nThe main technology used in home remote controls is infrared (IR) light. The signal between a remote control handset and the device it controls consists of pulses of infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye, but can be seen through a digital camera, video camera or a phone camera. The transmitter in the remote control handset sends out a stream of pulses of infrared light when the user presses a button on the handset. A transmitter is often a light emitting diode (LED) which is built into the pointing end of the remote control handset. The infrared light pulses form a pattern unique to that button. The receiver in the device recognizes the pattern and causes the device to respond accordingly.[22]\\r\\nMost remote controls for electronic appliances use a near infrared diode to emit a beam of light that reaches the device. A 940 nm wavelength LED is typical. This infrared light is invisible to the human eye, but picked up by sensors on the receiving device. Video cameras see the diode as if it produces visible purple light. With a single channel (single-function, one-button) remote control the presence of a carrier signal can be used to trigger a function. For multi-channel (normal multi-function) remote controls more sophisticated procedures are necessary: one consists of modulating the carrier with signals of different frequency. After the receiver demodulates the received signal, it applies the appropriate frequency filters to separate the respective signals. One can often hear the signals being modulated on the infrared carrier by operating a remote control in very close proximity to an AM radio not tuned to a station. Today, IR remote controls almost always use a pulse width modulated code, encoded and decoded by digital computer: a command from a remote control consists of a short train of pulses of carrier-present and carrier-not-present of varying widths.\\r\\nDifferent manufacturers of infrared remote controls use different protocols to transmit the infrared commands. The RC-5 protocol that has its origins within Philips, uses, for instance, a total of 14 bits for each button press. The bit pattern is modulated onto a carrier frequency that, again, can be different for different manufacturers and standards, in the case of RC-5, the carrier is 36?kHz. Other consumer infrared protocols include the various versions of SIRCS used by Sony, the RC-6 from Philips, the Ruwido R-Step, and the NEC TC101 protocol.\\r\\nSince infrared (IR) remote controls use light, they require line of sight to operate the destination device. The signal can, however, be reflected by mirrors, just like any other light source. If operation is required where no line of sight is possible, for instance when controlling equipment in another room or installed in a cabinet, many brands of IR extenders are available for this on the market. Most of these have an IR receiver, picking up the IR signal and relaying it via radio waves to the remote part, which has an IR transmitter mimicking the original IR control. Infrared receivers also tend to have a more or less limited operating angle, which mainly depends on the optical characteristics of the phototransistor. However, it's easy to increase the operating angle using a matte transparent object in front of the receiver.\\r\\nRadio remote control (RF remote control) is used to control distant objects using a variety of radio signals transmitted by the remote control device. As a complementary method to infrared remote controls, the radio remote control is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most remote controls use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal remote control duplicator because it is able to copy existing remote controls, while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any remote control in the market.\\r\\nA radio remote control system commonly has two parts: transmit and receive. The transmitter part is divided into two parts, the RF remote control and the transmitter module. This allows the transmitter module to be used as a component in a larger application. The transmitter module is small, but users must have detailed knowledge to use it; combined with the RF remote control it is much simpler to use.\\r\\nThe receiver is generally one of two types: a super-regenerative receiver or a superheterodyne. The super-regenerative receiver works like that of an intermittent oscillation detection circuit. The superheterodyne works like the one in a radio receiver. The superheterodyne receiver is used because of its stability, high sensitivity and it has relatively good anti-interference ability, a small package and lower price.\\r\\nRemote control is used for controlling substations, pump storage power stations and HVDC-plants. For these systems often PLC-systems working in the longwave range are used.\\r\\nGarage and gate remote control are very common, especially in some countries such as the US, Australia, and the UK, where garage doors, gates and barriers are widely used. Such a remote is very simple by design, usually only one button, and some with more buttons to control several gates from one control. Such remotes can be divided into two categories by the encoder type used: fixed code and rolling code. If you find dip-switches in the remote, it is likely to be fixed code, an older technology which was widely used. However, fixed code has been criticized for its (lack of) security, thus rolling code has been more and more widely used in later installations.\\r\\nRemote controls in military usage employ jamming and countermeasures against jamming. Jammers are used to disable or sabotage the enemy's use of remote controls. The distances for military remote controls also tend to be much longer, up to intercontinental distance satellite linked remote controls used by the U.S. for their unmanned airplanes (drones) in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. Remote controls are used by insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan to attack coalition and government troops with roadside improvised explosive devices, and terrorists in Iraq are reported in the media to use modified TV remote controls to detonate bombs.[23]\\r\\nIn World War I, the Imperial German Navy employed FL-boats (Fernlenkboote) against coastal shipping. These were driven by internal combustion engines, and controlled remotely from a shore station through several miles of wire wound on a spool on the boat. An aircraft was used to signal directions to the shore station. EMBs carried a high explosive charge in the bow and traveled at speeds of thirty knots.[24] The Soviet Red Army used remotely controlled teletanks during the 1930s in the Winter War against Finland and the early stages of World War II. A teletank is controlled by radio from a control tank at a distance of 500 to 1,500 meters, the two constituting a telemechanical group. The Red Army fielded at least two teletank battalions at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. There were also remotely controlled cutters and experimental remotely controlled planes in the Red Army.\\r\\nRemote control technology is also used in space travel, for instance the Soviet Lunokhod vehicles were remote-controlled from the ground. Many space exploration rovers can be remotely controlled, though vast distance to a vehicle results in a long time delay between transmission and receipt of a command.\\r\\nVideo game consoles had not used wireless controllers until recently, mainly because of the difficulty involved in playing the game while keeping the infrared transmitter pointed at the console, or like the Wii whose remotes require line of sight to the infrared sensor bar.[further explanation needed] Early wireless controllers were cumbersome and when powered on alkaline batteries, lasted only a few hours before they needed replacement. Some wireless controllers were produced by third parties, in most cases using a radio link instead of infrared. Even these were very inconsistent, and in some cases, had transmission delays, making them virtually useless. Some examples include the Double Player for NES, the Master System Remote Control System and the Wireless Dual Shot for the PlayStation.\\r\\nThe first official wireless game controller made by a first party manufacturer was the CX-42 for Atari 2600. The Philips CD-i 400 series also came with a remote control, the WaveBird was also produced for the GameCube. In the seventh generation of gaming consoles, wireless controllers became standard. Some wireless controllers, such as those of the PlayStation 3, use Bluetooth. Others, like the Xbox 360, use proprietary wireless protocols.\\r\\nExisting infrared remote controls can be used to control PC applications. Any application that supports shortcut keys can be controlled via IR remote controls from other home devices (TV, VCR, AC).[citation needed] This is widely used[citation needed] with multimedia applications for PC based home theatre systems.

After the tour's conclusion in the summer of 1990, Chaquico, Bloomfield, Morgan, and Stavropoulos left the band. Thomas added producer Peter Wolf[9] on keyboards and continued to record by utilizing session musicians. After the release of the greatest hits compilation Greatest Hits (Ten Years and Change 1979-1991) in the spring of 1991, the band was let go by RCA.[9] Starship became inactive at this time.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1992, Thomas reformed the band under the name \\"Mickey Thomas' Starship\\" (later \\"Starship featuring Mickey Thomas\\"),[2] with a lineup also including guitarist Jeff Tamelier, bassist Bobby Vega, drummer T.

Opened on October 1, 1971, the resort is owned and operated by Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products, a division of The Walt Disney Company. It was initially operated by Walt Disney World Company. The property covers nearly 25,000 acres (39?sq?mi; 101?km2),[2] featuring four theme parks, two water parks, twenty-seven themed resort hotels, nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center Disney Springs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesigned to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955, the complex was developed by Walt Disney in the 1960s. \\"The Florida Project\\", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its own diverse set of attractions. Walt Disney's original plans also called for the inclusion of an \\"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\\" (EPCOT), a planned community intended to serve as a test bed for new city living innovations. After extensive lobbying, the government of Florida created the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special government district that essentially gave The Walt Disney Company the standard powers and autonomy of an incorporated city. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during construction of the complex. Without Disney spearheading the construction, the company created a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning experimental concepts for a planned community. Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by Epcot in 1982, Disney's Hollywood Studios in 1989, and the most recent, Disney's Animal Kingdom in 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Walt Disney World is the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of over 52 million.[3] The resort is the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise, and has become a popular staple in American culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1959, Walt Disney Productions began looking for land to house a second resort to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955. Market surveys at the time revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the Mississippi River, where 75% of the population of the United States lived. Additionally, Walt Disney disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland and wanted more control over a larger area of land in the next project.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney flew over a potential site in Orlando, Florida ÿ one of many ÿ in November 1963. After witnessing the well-developed network of roads and taking the planned construction of both Interstate 4 and Florida's Turnpike into account, with McCoy Air Force Base (later Orlando International Airport) to the east, Disney selected a centrally-located site near Bay Lake.[5] To avoid a burst of land speculation, Walt Disney World Company used various dummy corporations to acquire 30,500 acres (48?sq?mi; 123?km2) of land.[5] In May 1965, some of these major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of Orlando in Osceola County. In addition, two large tracts totaling $1.5 million were sold, and smaller tracts of flatlands and cattle pastures were purchased by exotically-named companies such as the \\"Ayefour Corporation\\", \\"Latin-American Development and Management Corporation\\" and the \\"Reedy Creek Ranch Corporation\\". Some are now memorialized on a window above Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom. The smaller parcels of land acquired were called \\"outs\\". They were  5-acre (2?ha) lots platted in 1912 by the Munger Land Company and sold to investors. Most of the owners in the 1960s were happy to get rid of the land, which was mostly swamp at the time. Another issue was the mineral rights to the land, which were owned by Tufts University. Without the transfer of these rights, Tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals. Eventually, Disney's team negotiated a deal with Tufts to buy the mineral rights for $15,000.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking strictly in secrecy, real estate agents unaware of their client's identity began making offers to landowners in April 1964 in parts of southwest Orange and northwest Osceola counties. The agents were careful not to reveal the extent of their intentions, and they were able to negotiate numerous land contracts with some including large tracts of land for as little as $100 an acre.[7] With the understanding that the recording of the first deeds would trigger intense public scrutiny, Disney delayed the filing of paperwork until a large portion of the land was under contract.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly rumors and speculation about the land purchases assumed possible development by NASA in support of the nearby Kennedy Space Center, as well as references to other famous investors such as Ford, the Rockefellers, and Howard Hughes.[8] An Orlando Sentinel news article published weeks later on May 20, 1965, acknowledged a popular rumor that Disney was building an \\"East Coast\\" version of Disneyland. However, the publication denied its accuracy based on an earlier interview with Disney at Kennedy Space Center, in which he claimed a $50 million investment was in the works for Disneyland, and that he had no interest in building a new park.[8] In October 1965, editor Emily Bavar from the Sentinel visited Disneyland during the park's 10th-anniversary celebration. In an interview with Disney, she asked him if he was behind recent land purchases in Central Florida; Bavar later described that Disney \\"looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face\\" before denying the story.[8] His reaction, combined with other research obtained during her Anaheim visit, led Bavar to author a story on October 21, 1965, where she predicted that Disney was building a second theme park in Florida.[8] Three days later after gathering more information from various sources, the Sentinel published another article headlined, \\"We Say: 'Mystery Industry' Is Disney\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney had originally planned to publicly reveal Disney World on November 15, 1965, but in light of the Sentinel story, Disney asked Florida Governor Haydon Burns to confirm the story on October 25. His announcement called the new theme park \\"the greatest attraction in the history of Florida\\".[8] The official reveal was kept on the previously-planned November 15 date, and Disney joined Burns in Orlando for the event.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney died from circulatory collapse caused by lung cancer on December 15, 1966, before his vision was realized. His brother and business partner, Roy O. Disney, postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a press conference at the Park Theatres in Winter Park, Florida. The role of EPCOT was emphasized in the film that was played. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the Reedy Creek Improvement District with two cities inside it, Bay Lake and Reedy Creek, now Lake Buena Vista. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections.[4] The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967.[9] The Supreme Court of Florida then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district, despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe district soon began construction of drainage canals, and Disney built the first roads and the Magic Kingdom. The Contemporary Resort Hotel and Polynesian Village were also completed in time for the park's opening on October 1, 1971.[10][11] The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before, while Fort Wilderness opened a month later. 24 days after the park opened, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as \\"Walt Disney World\\" in his brother's honor. In his own words: \\"Everyone has heard of Ford cars. But have they all heard of Henry Ford, who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here.\\" After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, Lillian, what she thought of Walt Disney World. According to biographer Bob Thomas, she responded, \\"I think Walt would have approved.\\" Roy Disney died at age 78 on December 20, 1971, less than three months after the property opened.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmission prices in 1971 were $3.50 for adults, $2.50 for juniors under age 18, and one dollar for children under twelve.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of Walt Disney's plans for his Progress City were abandoned after his death and after the company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city. The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, EPCOT Center, which opened in 1982 (renamed EPCOT in 1996). While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, the park is closer to a world's fair than a \\"community of tomorrow\\". One of EPCOT's main attractions is their world's showcase which highlights 11 countries across the globe. Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of Celebration much later. The resort's third theme park, Disney-MGM Studios (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989 and is inspired by show business. The resort's fourth theme park, Disney's Animal Kingdom, opened in 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Kalogridis was named president of the resort in December 2012, replacing Meg Crofton, who had overseen the site since 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 21, 2016, the resort's management structure was changed, with general managers within a theme park being in charge of an area or land, instead of on a functional basis as previously. Theme parks have already had a vice-president overseeing them. Disney Springs and Disney Sports were also affected. Now hotel general managers manage a single hotel instead of some managing multiple hotels.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 18, 2017, it was announced that resort visitors could bring dogs to Disney's Yacht Club Resort, Disney Port Orleans Resort ÿ Riverside, Disney's Art of Animation Resort and Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resort has a number of expansion projects planned or ongoing, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Florida resort is not within Orlando city limits but is southwest of Downtown Orlando. Much of the resort is in southwestern Orange County, with the remainder in adjacent Osceola County. The property includes the cities of Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake which are governed by the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The site is accessible from Central Florida's Interstate 4 via Exits 62B (World Drive), 64B (US 192 West), 65B (Osceola Parkway West), 67B (SR 536 West), and 68 (SR 535 North), and Exit 8 on SR 429, the Western Expressway. At its founding, the resort occupied approximately 30,500 acres (48?sq?mi; 123?km2). Portions of the property have since been sold or de-annexed, including land now occupied by the Disney-built community of Celebration.  Now the resort occupies nearly 25,000 acres (39?sq?mi; 101?km2).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nCinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom\\r\\n\\r\\nSpaceship Earth at Epcot\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese Theatre at Disney's Hollywood Studios\\r\\n\\r\\nTree of Life at Disney's Animal Kingdom\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney's property includes four golf courses. The three 18-hole golf courses are Disney's Palm (4.5 stars), Disney's Magnolia (4 stars), and Disney's Lake Buena Vista (4 stars). There is also a nine-hole walking course (no electric carts allowed) called Oak Trail, designed for young golfers. The Magnolia and Palm courses played home to the PGA Tour's Children's Miracle Network Hospitals Classic. Arnold Palmer Golf Management manages the Disney golf courses.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, there are two themed miniature golf complexes, each with two courses, Fantasia Gardens and Winter Summerland.[23] The two courses at Fantasia Gardens are Fantasia Garden and Fantasia Fairways. The Garden course is a traditional miniature-style course based on the \\"Fantasia\\" movies with musical holes, water fountains and characters. Fantasia Fairways is a traditional golf course on miniature scale having water hazards and sand traps.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two courses at Winter Summerland are Summer and Winter, both themed around Santa. Summer is the more challenging of the two 18-hole courses.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the thirty-four resorts and hotels on the Walt Disney World property, twenty-eight are owned and operated by Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products. These are classified into four categories? Deluxe, Moderate, Value, and Disney Vacation Club Villas? and are located in one of five resort areas: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Wide World of Sports, Animal Kingdom, or Disney Springs resort areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile all of the Deluxe resort hotels have achieved an AAA Four Diamond rating, Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa is considered the highest tier flagship luxury resort on the Walt Disney World Resort complex.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, Walt Disney World's flagship resort\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney's Polynesian Resort, a deluxe level resort\\r\\n\\r\\nCaribbean Beach Resort, the first moderate resort at Walt Disney World\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Wilderness, Disney's campground and cabin resort\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney's All Star Movies Resort, one of five value resorts\\r\\n\\r\\nShades of Green Resort, owned and operated by the United States Military\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Dolphin\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Swan\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hilton at Walt Disney World, located at Hotel Plaza Boulevard\\r\\n\\r\\nGuests with a Disney Resort reservation (excluding the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin) that arrive at Orlando International Airport can be transported to their resort from the airport using the complimentary Disney Magical Express service, which is operated by Mears Destination Services. Guests can also have their bags picked up and transported to their resort for them through a contract with BAGS Incorporated on participating airlines. Many resorts feature Airline Check-in counters for guests returning to the airport. Here their bags will be checked all the way through to their final destination and they can also have boarding passes printed for them. Some participating airlines are Delta, United, American, Jet Blue, Southwest and Alaska Airlines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, the resort's four theme parks all ranked in the top 8 on the list of the 25 most visited theme parks in the world; (1st) Magic Kingdom - 19,332,000 visitors, (6th) Epcot - 11,454,000 visitors, (7th) Disney's Animal Kingdom - 10,402,000 visitors, and (8th) Disney's Hollywood Studios - 10,312,000 visitors.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Resort is serviced by Disney Transport, a complimentary mass transportation system allowing guest access across the property. The Walt Disney World Monorail System provides free transportation at Walt Disney World. Guests can aboard the monorail from select on property resorts including The Grand Floridian and The Polynesian. The system operates on three routes that interconnect at the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC), adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. A fleet of Disney-operated buses on property, branded Disney Transport, is also complimentary for guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from water taxis, up to the ferries that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center. Disney Transport is also responsible for maintaining the fleet of parking lot trams that are used for shuttling visitors between the various theme park parking lots and their respective main entrances.\\r\\n\\r\\nA gondola lift system, dubbed Disney Skyliner, is under construction as of June 2018.  The system's three lines will connect Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot with four resort hotels.[19]  Completion is expected some time in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney World previously had its own small airport:  the Walt Disney World Airport which was also known as the Lake Buena Vista STOLport.  During the early 1970s, scheduled passenger service was operated by Shawnee Airlines with small de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter commuter turboprops which had STOL (short take off and landing) capabilities on flights to Tampa and Orlando.[42][43]  The airport is no longer in operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Magic Kingdom opened in 1971, the site employed about 5,500 \\"cast members\\".[44] Today, Walt Disney World employs more than 74,000 cast members,[45] spending more than $1.2 billion on payroll and $474 million on benefits each year. The largest single-site employer in the United States,[46][47] Walt Disney World has more than 3,700 job classifications. The resort also sponsors and operates the Walt Disney World College Program, an internship program that offers American college students (CP's) the opportunity to live about 15 miles (24?km) off-site in four Disney-owned apartment complexes and work at the resort, and thereby provides much of the theme park and resort \\"front line\\" cast members. There is also the Walt Disney World International College Program, an internship program that offers international college students (ICP's) from all over the world the same opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney World's corporate culture uses jargon based on theatrical terminology.[48][49]  For example, park visitors are always \\"guests\\", employees are called \\"cast members\\", rides are \\"attractions\\" or \\"adventures\\", cast members costumed as famous Disney characters in a way that does not cover their faces are known as \\"face characters\\", jobs are \\"roles\\", and public and nonpublic areas are respectively labeled \\"onstage\\" and \\"backstage\\".[48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney's security personnel are generally dressed in typical security guard uniforms, though some of the personnel are dressed as tourists in plain clothes. Since September 11, 2001, uniformed security has been stationed just outside each Disney park in Florida to search guests' bags as they enter the parks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land where Walt Disney World resides is part of the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID), a governing jurisdiction created in 1967 by the State of Florida at the request of Disney.  RCID provides 911 services, fire, environmental protection, building code enforcement, utilities and road maintenance but does not provide law enforcement services.  The approximately 800 security staff are instead considered employees of the Walt Disney Company.  Arrests and citations are issued by the Florida Highway Patrol along with the Orange County and Osceola County sheriffs deputies who patrol the roads.  Disney security does maintain a fleet of security vans equipped with flares, traffic cones, and chalk commonly used by police officers. These security personnel are charged with traffic control by the RCID and may only issue personnel violation notices to Disney and RCID employees, not the general public.[50][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the appearance of the uniformed security personnel, they are not considered a legal law enforcement agency. Disney and The Reedy Creek Improvement District were sued for access to Disney Security records by Bob and Kathy Sipkema following the death of their son at the resort in 1994. The court characterized Disney security as a \\"night watchman\\" service not a law enforcement agency and was not subject to Florida's open records laws.  An appeals court later upheld the lower court's ruling.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2015, Disney confirmed the addition of randomized secondary screenings and dogs trained to detect body-worn explosives within parks, in addition to metal detectors at entrances. It has also increased the number of uniformed security personnel at Walt Disney World and Disneyland properties.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisney Security personnel in Florida have investigated traffic accidents and issued accident reports. The forms used by Disney Security may be confused with official, government forms by some.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Orange County Sheriff maintains an office on Disney property, but this is primarily to process guests accused of shoplifting by Disney security personnel.[54]","input":"What was the first theme park in disney world?"},{"output":"Ice hockey","context":"Sports in Canada consist of a wide variety of games.  The most common sports are ice hockey, lacrosse, gridiron football, soccer, basketball, curling and baseball, with ice hockey and lacrosse being the official winter and summer sports, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIce hockey, referred to as simply \\"hockey\\", is Canada's most prevalent winter sport, its most popular spectator sport, and its most successful sport in international competition. It is Canada's official national winter sport.  Lacrosse, a sport with Indigenous origins, is Canada's oldest and official summer sport. Canadian football is Canada's second most popular spectator sport, being the most popular in the prairie provinces. [1]. The Canadian Football League's annual championship, the Grey Cup, is one of the country's largest annual sports events.[2] While other sports have a larger spectator base, Association football, known in Canada as soccer in both English and French, has the most registered players of any team sport in Canada.[3] Professional teams exist in many cities in Canada. Statistics Canada[4] reports that the top ten sports that Canadians participate in are golf, ice hockey, swimming, soccer, basketball, baseball, volleyball, skiing (downhill and alpine), cycling and tennis.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a country with a generally cool climate, Canada has  enjoyed greater success at the Winter Olympics than at the Summer Olympics, although significant regional variations in climate allow for a wide variety of both team and individual sports. Major multi-sport events in Canada include the 1988 and 2010 Winter Olympics, and the 1976 Summer Olympics. Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, while the Lou Marsh Trophy is awarded annually to Canada's top athlete by a panel of journalists. There are numerous other Sports Halls of Fames in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of Canadian sports falls into five stages of development: early recreational activities before 1840; the start of organized competition, 1840-1880; the emergence of national organizations, 1882-1914; the rapid growth of both amateur and professional sports, 1914 to 1960; and developments of the last century [6]  Some sports, especially hockey, lacrosse and curling enjoy an international reputation as particularly Canadian.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFederal and provincial governments are both actively involved in sports each has areas of jurisdiction which overlap sports. Sport Canada generally directs (or at least co-ordinates) federal activity in sports. While the federal government generally tries to take a leadership role in areas of international competition (where its jurisdiction is clearest) some provinces, especially Quebec, are actively involved in sports at all levels, even with elite international athletes.  Provinces will often focus on student athletics, as it falls more clearly in an area of provincial jurisdiction (that being education).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nU Sports is the national governing body for university sports, while the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association governs college sports. A factor which affects athletic participation levels in U Sports member institutions is the U Sports restriction that scholarships cover tuition only, drawing many of Canada's best student athletes to the United States where organizations such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) allow \\"full ride\\" scholarships which include tuition, books, housing, and travel. Another is the popular Canadian Hockey League (for male hockey players aged 15 to 20), which effectively serves as the primary development league for the professional National Hockey League, although CHL teams offer financial support for players who choose to play U Sports hockey after leaving the CHL.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its founding, Canada's official sport was lacrosse. In 1994, First Nations groups objected to a government bill that proposed establishing ice hockey as Canada's national sport, arguing that it neglected recognition of the game of lacrosse, a uniquely Native contribution. In response, the House of Commons amended a bill \\"to recognize hockey as Canada's Winter Sport and lacrosse as Canada's Summer Sport,\\" although lacrosse is played all year, in all seasons, indoor and outdoors. On May 12, 1994, the National Sports of Canada Act came into force with these designations.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern form of ice hockey began in Canada in the late 19th century, and is widely considered Canada's national pastime, with high levels of participation by children, men and women at various levels of competition. The Stanley Cup, considered the premiere trophy in professional ice hockey, originated in Canada in 1893. Prominent trophies for national championships in Canada are the Memorial Cup for the top junior-age men's team and the Allan Cup for the top men's senior team. There are national championships in several other divisions of play. Hockey Canada is the sport's official governing body in Canada and is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). A Canadian national men's team, composed of professionals, competes in the annual IIHF Men's World Championship and in the Olympics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional hockey league that includes teams from both Canada and the United States. The NHL includes seven teams in Canada: the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks, and the Winnipeg Jets. The Canadian NHL presence peaked with eight teams in the mid-1990s, before the Quebec Nordiques relocated to Denver, Colorado in 1995 and a previous incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona in 1996. The NHL returned to Winnipeg in 2011 when the Atlanta Thrashers relocated and became the current Winnipeg Jets. The league, founded in Canada, retains a substantial Canadian content as roughly half of its players are Canadian. Hockey Night in Canada is a longtime national Saturday night television broadcast featuring Canadian NHL teams. Junior-age ice hockey is also a popular spectator sport. The junior-age Canadian Hockey League is broadcast nationally and its annual championship is a popular television event. The annual IIHF World U20 Championship, played during December and January, is popular among Canadian television viewers and has been held in Canada numerous times due to its popularity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Nations began playing the sport more than 500 years ago. Today lacrosse not only remains an integral part of native culture, but is played by tens of thousands of people across Canada and the north eastern United States. From its origin as 'The Creator's Game' to the healthy popularity of the modern game, lacrosse has survived the test of time after treading down a long, controversial path that led it to become recognized as Canada's official national sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian Lacrosse Association, founded in 1925, is the governing body of lacrosse in Canada. It conducts national junior and senior championship tournaments for men and women in both field and box lacrosse. It also participated in the inaugural World Indoor Lacrosse Championship in 2003. As of 2018, the only active professional lacrosse league in Canada is the National Lacrosse League, which plays a indoors variation of the game known as box lacrosse. A total of four of the league's eleven franchises are located in Canada: the Vancouver Warriors, Calgary Roughnecks, Saskatchewan Rush, and Toronto Rock). The 2006 World Lacrosse Championship was held in London, Ontario. Canada beat the United States 15-10 in the final to break a 28-year U.S. winning streak. One of the best lacrosse players of all time, Gary Gait was born in Victoria, British Columbia and has won every possible major lacrosse championship. Great achievements in Canadian Lacrosse are recognized by the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian rules football in Canada is a minor participation sport. The governing body for the sport in the country is AFL Canada. The sport has been played in the country since 1989 when the first league was formed. The sport is quickly becoming popular with the Ontario Australian Football League being the biggest outside of Australia. There are Canadian national teams with the Canada national Australian rules football team the men's team, and a women's national team both who regularly play international matches and play in the Australian Football International Cup which is essentially a World Cup for all countries apart from Australia which is the only place where the sport is played professionally. Mike Pyke, a native of Victoria, British Columbia and a former Canada Rugby International, became the first Canadian to play in the Australian Football League when he was drafted by the Sydney Swans in 2008. Pyke went on to become the first Canadian to play in an AFL premiership (championship-winning) team when the Swans won the 2012 AFL Grand Final.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's first documented baseball game took place in Beachville, Ontario on June 4, 1838.[citation needed]  Although more strongly associated with the United States, baseball has existed in Canada from the very beginning. The world's oldest baseball park still in operation is Labatt Park in London, Ontario.[citation needed] It is home to the London Majors of the semi-pro Intercounty Baseball League.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Toronto Blue Jays are Canada's only Major League Baseball team, founded in 1977. The Montreal Expos club played in Montreal from 1969 until 2004 when they moved to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals. The Blue Jays were the first non-American team to host a World Series Game (in 1992) and the only non-American team to win the World Series (back to back in 1992 and 1993). The Blue Jays had the highest attendance in Major League Baseball during the late 1980s and early 1990s.[citation needed] Professional baseball has a long history in Canada, beginning with teams such as the London Tecumsehs, Montreal Royals, and Toronto Maple Leafs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. All three were included on the National Baseball Association's top 100 minor league teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of Canadians have played in the major leagues, and several have won the highest honours in baseball. Ferguson Jenkins won the National League Cy Young Award in 1971 as the best pitcher in the league, and in 1991 became the first Canadian inducted in the (U.S.) Baseball Hall of Fame. Larry Walker was National League MVP for the 1997 season and was the league's batting champion 3 times.  Since 2000, ric Gagn won the National League Cy Young Award in 2003, Jason Bay was the first Canadian to be named rookie of the year in 2004, and Justin Morneau (American League, 2006) and Joey Votto (National League, 2010) have won MVP honours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canada national baseball team has participated in all editions of the World Baseball Classic. In the 2006 World Baseball Classic, the team upset Team USA in first-round play,[10] which some people in Canada call the \\"Miracle on Dirt\\" (a play on the phrase \\"Miracle on Ice\\" for the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey team). However, the team has yet to progress past the first round.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only Canadian team in MLB-affiliated minor leagues is the Vancouver Canadians of the Northwest League (Short-Season A). There are a number of independent minor league teams, as well as semi-professional and collegiate baseball teams in Canada (see List of baseball teams in Canada). Great achievements in Canadian baseball are recognized by the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasketball has very strong roots in Canada. The inventor, James Naismith, was Canadian; born in Almonte, Ontario, he was working as a physical education instructor in Massachusetts when he created the game in 1891.  As many as 10 of the players in that first game were Canadian students from Quebec.[citation needed] Basketball is a popular sport in parts of Canada, especially in Nova Scotia, Southern Alberta, and more recently Southern Ontario.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popularity of basketball in Nova Scotia is at the high school and college level.  Nova Scotia is home to three perennially strong college basketball programs. Saint Mary's University, Acadia University, and St. Francis Xavier University have made 22, 21, and 13 appearances in the Canadian University championship, respectively. Carleton University has dominated the Canadian University championship in recent years, winning six titles in seven years from 2003 to 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour Canadian-born individuals have been inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of FameNaismith and longtime U.S. college coach and instructor Pete Newell as contributors; Ernie Quigley, who officiated over 1,500 U.S. college games, as a referee; and Bob Houbregs, a superstar at the University of Washington in the early 1950s who went on to a career in the NBA. Newell is also separately recognized by the Hall as the head coach of the 1960 USA Olympic team, which won a gold medal in overwhelming fashion and was inducted as a unit in 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) recognizes its first ever game as being a contest between the New York Knickerbockers and Toronto Huskies at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on November 1, 1946.[11]\\r\\nThe NBA expanded into Canada in 1995 with the addition of the Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies. The Grizzlies moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001, but the Raptors continue to draw healthy crowds at the Air Canada Centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nA record 13 Canadian players10 born in the country, two naturalized, and one U.S.-born dual citizenwere on NBA rosters at the start of the 2014ÿ15?season.[12] The number of Canadian players dropped by one, to 12, at the start of the 2015ÿ16?season.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, the term \\"football\\" is used to refer to Canadian football, a gridiron-based game closely related to but distinct from American football as played in the United States. Canadian football has its origins in Rugby football beginning in the early 1860s,[14] but, over time, a unique code known as Canadian football developed. The first documented football match was a game played at University College, University of Toronto on November 9, 1861. A football club was formed at the university soon afterwards, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first documented football game was played at University College, University of Toronto on November 9, 1861. One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school. A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear. In 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland and Frederick A. Bethune devised rules based on rugby football. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, modern Canadian football is widely regarded as having originated with a game of rugby played in Montreal, in 1865, when British Army officers played local civilians. The game gradually gained a following, and the Montreal Football Club was formed in 1868, the first recorded non-university football club in Canada. This rugby-football soon became popular at Montreal's McGill University. McGill challenged Harvard University to a game, in 1874. The game grew in parallel from this point onward in the USA and Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian football is also played at the high school, junior, collegiate, and semi-professional levels: the Canadian Junior Football League and Quebec Junior Football League are for players aged 18ÿ22, many post-secondary institutions compete for the Vanier Cup. The Vanier Cup is the championship for U Sports football, the post-secondary Canadian football league. In addition, senior leagues such as the Alberta Football League have grown in popularity in recent years. Great achievements in Canadian football are recognized by the Canadian Football Hall of Fame which is located in Hamilton, Ontario.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the Canadian Football League (CFL), the sport's only professional football league in Canada, and Football Canada, the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1884 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union. Currently active teams such as the Toronto Argonauts and Hamilton Tiger-Cats have similar longevity. The CFL's championship game, the Grey Cup, is the country's single largest sporting event and is watched by nearly one third of Canadian television households.[2] The nine CFL teams are the B.C. Lions, Calgary Stampeders, Edmonton Eskimos, Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Toronto Argonauts, Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Montreal Alouettes, and Ottawa Redblacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nCricket never caught on in Canada the way it did in the rest of the British Empire.[15]  While Canada is not sanctioned to play Test matches, the national team does take part in One Day International (ODI) matches and also in first-class games (in the ICC Intercontinental Cup) against other non-Test-playing opposition, with the rivalry against the United States being as strong in cricket as it is in other team sports. The match between these two nations is in fact the oldest international fixture in cricket, having first been played in 1844.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most famous cricketer is John Davison, an Australian, born in Canada, who played for Canadian national cricket teams. Canada has participated in the 1979, 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cups. It also participated most recently in the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada Senior Men's team qualified in April 2009 at the ICC World Cup qualifier held in South Africa to compete in 2011 World Cup, their third World Cup appearance in a row.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) sanctioned the Global T20 Canada, the first franchise-based Twenty20 league in North America.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurling is most popular in the prairie provinces with the most competitive teams in recent years coming from the provinces of Alberta and Manitoba. However, curling has a degree of popularity across the country. For example, a team from Quebec, which is not a traditional hotbed of curling, won the Tim Hortons Brier (national men's championship) in 2006. The Scotties Tournament of Hearts is the national women's championship. Curling Canada is the sport's national governing body; great achievements are recognized by the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, organized disc sports began in the early 1970s, with promotional efforts from Irwin Toy (Frisbee distributor in Canada), the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships, Toronto (1972ÿ85) and professionals using Frisbee show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events.[19] Disc sports such as freestyle, double disc court, guts, ultimate and disc golf became this sports first events.[20][21] Two sports, the team sport of disc ultimate and disc golf are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi-professionally.[22][23] The World Flying Disc Federation, Professional Disc Golf Association, and the Freestyle Players Association are the rules and sanctioning organizations for flying disc sports worldwide. Ultimate Canada is the rules and sanctioning organization for disc ultimate in Canada.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, as a founding partner, the Toronto Ultimate Club presented Canada's first semi-professional Ultimate team, the Toronto Rush, to the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL). They went undefeated 18-0 and won the AUDL Championships.[25][26][27]\\r\\nIn 2014, the Montreal Royal and the Vancouver Riptide joined the AUDL. In 2015, the Ottawa Outlaws became the fourth Canadian team to compete in the AUDL, of 26 teams in total.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) granted full recognition to the World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) for flying disc sports including Ultimate.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sport of quidditch inspired by Harry Potter novels came to McGill University in 2008. Since then, the University of Ottawa, Carleton University and other universities began creating teams and competing at national and international levels. It has about 500 players in Canada.[30] Quidditch Canada is the governing body that overseas the sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nRugby league first appeared in Canada in the 20th century, although by the end of the century, the sport had disappeared entirely from the nation. However, the 21st century has seen the game re-introduced to Canada. Internationally, Canada is represented by the Canadian Wolverines and Canada will co-host the 2025 Rugby League World Cup with the United States. Domestically, the Canada Rugby League (CRL) runs several amateur and semi-professional club competitions. \\r\\n\\r\\nToronto Wolfpack, the first fully professional team of any code of rugby football in Canada, began play in 2017 in the predominantly British and French Rugby Football League system. The new franchise started in the 3rd tier League 1, which offers a Promotion and relegation route to the Super League and won promotion to the 2nd tier Championship in its inaugural season. The team also competes in the Challenge Cup. Their home ground is Lamport Stadium in Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada has around 13,000 seniors and twice as many junior players spread across the country. Many of these come from Canada's rugby stronghold of British Columbia while also being strong in Newfoundland and Ontario. The Canadian Rugby Championship is the premier domestic rugby union competition since 2009, featuring four regionally based Canadian teams. In 2009, the top two teams advanced to the Americas Rugby Championship, where they faced the A national teams from Argentina and the United States. Since 2010, the country is represented at the ARC by one team, Canada A.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sport's domestic governing body, Rugby Canada, scrapped its previous national competition, the Rugby Canada Super League, in favour of a new national under-20 league, the Rugby Canada National Junior Championship. Also in 2009, Rugby Canada entered into a partnership with the Welsh Rugby Union by which the new Welsh regional side RGC 1404, created to develop the sport in North Wales, would also include a number of young Canadian players.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian national side have competed in every Rugby World Cup to date, yet have only won one match each tournament with the exception of the 1991 tournament where they reached the quarter finals and the 2007 tournament when their best result was a draw against Japan in the group stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighlights include famous victories over Scotland and Wales, and regular wins over their North American neighbours, the United States. Known for their trademark \\"hard nosed\\" style of play, many Canadian players play their trade professionally in English and French leagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile association football, known as soccer in Canada in both English and French, has been played in the country since 1876, the Dominion of Canada Football Association was inaugurated on May 24, 1912, and initially became a member of the Fdration Internationale de Football Association on December 31, 1912. Today, Canada's governing body for Association Football (both professional and amateur) is known as the Canadian Soccer Association.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoccer is the highest participation sport in Canada, with 847,616 registered players (according to the Canada Soccer 2012 Yearbook). Male/female participation is split roughly 59/41 percent. There are 1,456 clubs in 139 districts across 12 regions (provincial and territory member associations).\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's annual amateur competition is known as the National Championships. Senior men's teams play for The Challenge Trophy while senior women's teams play for The Jubilee Trophy. The men's national competition was first played in 1913, with the trophy (Connaught Cup) donated by Canadian Governor-General, the Duke of Connaught. The women's national competition was first played in 1982. The Canadian Soccer Association's annual National Championships also feature competitions at the U-18, U-16 and U-14 levels. At all levels, clubs qualify for the National Championships through their respective provincial championships.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the St. Louis 1904 Olympics, Canada won the gold medal in Association Football. The Canadian team was represented by Galt FC of Ontario. From 1967 to 1988, Canada's best men's amateur footballers also participated in Olympic Qualifying tournaments (although in the 1980s a number of those players were indeed professional). Canada qualified as host of the Montral 1976 Olympics and then again for the Los Angeles 1984 Olympics (where it finished fifth overall). Since the early 1990s, the Men's Olympic Qualifying tournaments have featured U-23 footballers (with a mix of professional and amateur/university players). \\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's annual professional competition is the Canadian Championship, which is competed by Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps FC, Montreal Impact, Ottawa Fury FC, and the champions of League1 Ontario and the Premire Ligue de soccer du Qubec. The national champion qualifies for the CONCACAF Champions League from which a confederation champion then qualifies for the annual FIFA Club World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the teams in the Canadian Championship play in U.S.-based leagues. Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps FC and Montreal Impact plays in Major League Soccer. FC Edmonton plays in the second-level North American Soccer League, and Ottawa Fury FC voluntarily dropped from the NASL to the third-level United Soccer League after the 2016 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian Premier League is a professional soccer league that will begin play in 2019, consisting of an expected 8-10 teams all in Canadian markets not served by Major League Soccer. The league will have a minimum requirement of Canadian players on each roster requirements, to develop Canadian talent. The eventual goal of the league is to have multiple divisions with promotion and relegation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's best soccer playersmale and femaleplay in professional leagues around the world. Players are called into the national program at different times of the year, primarily in conjunction with the FIFA International Calendar (when professional clubs are required to release players for national duty).\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's national teams compete in CONCACAF, the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football. Canada's national \\"A\\" team has won two CONCACAF championships: in 1985 to qualify for the FIFA World Cup and in 2000 to qualify for the FIFA Confederations Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's women's \\"A\\" team has also won two CONCACAF championships: in 1998 and 2010. The Canadian women have participated in six FIFA Women's World Cups (Sweden 1995, United States 1999, United States 2003, China 2007, Germany 2011 and as hosts in 2015) and three Women's Olympic Football Tournaments (Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016), winning a bronze medal in both London and Rio. Canada also hosted the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2015. The country has also hosted four age-grade World Cupsthe FIFA U-17 World Cup in 1987 (when the age limit was 16 instead of the current 17), the inaugural FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in 2002 (when the age limit was 19 instead of 20), the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2007, and the U-20 Women's World Cup for a second time in 2014. Canada will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup sharing with Mexico and United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sport of bowling takes several forms in Canada, including ten-pin and lawn bowling, but most notably Canada has its own version: Five-pin bowling, which was invented circa 1909 by Thomas F. Ryan in Toronto, Ontario, at his Toronto Bowling Club, in response to customers who complained that the ten-pin game was too strenuous. He cut five tenpins down to about 75% of their size, and used hand-sized hard rubber balls, thus inventing the original version of five-pin bowling.[31]  Five-pin is played in all parts of Canada, but not played in any other country.  Candlepin bowling is played at several centres in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sport of boxing has a long history in Canada. Canada has produced several world champions, including heavyweights Tommy Burns and Lennox Lewis. Boxing is generally learned in independent gyms, located in most large Canadian cities. Canadian boxers compete in the Olympic Games and often then turn professional.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese martial art Judo has been practised in Canada for nearly a century. The first Judo dojo in Canada, Tai Iku Dojo, was established in Vancouver in 1924 by Shigetaka \\"Steve\\" Sasaki.[32] Today, an estimated 30,000 Canadians participate in Judo programs in approximately 400 clubs across Canada.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadians have won five Olympic medals in Judo since it was added to the Summer games in 1964. Doug Rogers won silver in the +80?kg category in 1964, Mark Berger won bronze in the +95?kg category in 1984, Nicolas Gill won bronze in the 86?kg category in 1992 and silver in the 100?kg category in 2000, and Antoine Valois-Fortier won bronze in the -81?kg category in 2012. The Canadian Judo team trains at the National Training Centre in Montreal under Gill's direction.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nMMA is a young and growing sport in Canada,[citation needed] which has produced several notable fighters in the UFC and other promotions. Canada is the home of former UFC Welterweight Champion Georges St-Pierre as well as current Bellator MMA Welterweight Champion Rory McDonald.\\r\\n\\r\\nWrestling in Canada is very popular both as a recreational and as a competitive sport, and takes a variety of forms, reflecting Canada's diverse and multicultural makeup. At the middle, high school and collegiate level there is a broad-based varsity participation in Freestyle Wrestling and Greco-Roman Wrestling. Outside of schools among the general population, the dominant forms of wrestling are Judo, Submission Grappling, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Sambo. Each of these forms of wrestling was brought to Canada from abroad both by coaches who immigrated to Canada from elsewhere and by students of the sport who studied it overseas and returned with their enthusiasm. Examples of famous Canadian wrestlers among these various wrestling sports are such as Daniel Igali for Freestyle Wrestling, Nicolas Gill, Ron Angus and Keith Morgan for Judo, Marc Bocek for both Submission Grappling and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. Canada has a strong showing on the international scene, at world championships and at the Olympics in all these wrestling sports.\\r\\n\\r\\nCycling has increased its participation in the past few years. Several new genres of the sport have become popular in Canada, including  slopestyle competition, four cross, downhill racing, dirt jumping, and freeride. With the sport increasing bikes have also increased in quality and durability.\\r\\n\\r\\nGolf is a widely enjoyed recreational sport in Canada, and the country boasts several highly rated courses. Golf Canada, historically the Royal Canadian Golf Association, is the governing organization, and has over 1,600 associated member clubs and over 300,000 individual members.[35] Golf Canada also conducts the only PGA Tour and LPGA tour events in Canada, and it also manages the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame. PGA Tour Canada, formerly known as the \\"Peter Jackson Tour\\" and \\"Canadian Professional Golf Tour\\" (or Canadian Tour), owned and operated by the PGA Tour since late 2012, operates an organization that runs a series of tournaments for professional players. In its first season under PGA Tour operation in 2013, it held a qualifying school in California, and followed it with nine tournaments in Canada. The 2014 season saw significant expansion. Three qualifying schools were heldone in California, another in Florida, and finally in British Columbia. The BC qualifier was followed by a series of 12 tournaments, all in Canada. The top five money-winners on the tour earn full membership in the following season of the PGA Tour's second-level Web.com Tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nOntario's Mike Weir won the 2003 Masters, becoming the first Canadian man to win one of golf's majors. The first Canadian to win any recognized major championship was Sandra Post, winner of the LPGA Championship in 1968. From 1979 through 2000, the du Maurier Classic (now known as the Canadian Women's Open) was one of the LPGA's four majors. The most recent Canadian of either sex to win a major championship was Brooke Henderson, who won the 2016 Women's PGA Championship; she is also notable as the youngest person ever to win a professional golf tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian Grand Prix Formula One auto race had been conducted every year since 1967, and since 1978 had been held at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, apart from 1987 when a dispute arose between brewers Labatts and Molson over sponsorship, and again in 2009 when the race was not on the FIA calendar for one year.[36] The track was named for Canada's first Grand Prix driver, the late Gilles Villeneuve, whose son, Jacques, won the Formula One World championship in 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral Canadians have starred in American Championship Car Racing, most notably Jacques Villeneuve, who won the 1995 CART championship and Indianapolis 500 before moving to Formula One, and Paul Tracy, who captured the 2003 CART title and collected 31 race wins. Races were held in Mont-Tremblant and Mosport road courses and on street circuits in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Edmonton. In 2008, Champ Car merged with its long-time rival, the Indy Racing League (since renamed INDYCAR), under the banner of the latter body's top series, the IndyCar Series. The Edmonton race was transferred over to the new series immediately, and the Toronto event was added for 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nCASCAR (the Canadian Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) was the country's governing body for amateur and professional stock car racing, and the CASCAR Super Series was the highest-level stock car racing series in the country. In 2006, NASCAR purchased CASCAR and rebranded the Super Series as the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series, now known as the NASCAR Pinty's Series; nevertheless, the series remains Canada's top-level stock car racing circuit. In 2007 the Castrol Canadian Touring Car Championship was formed.\\r\\nBecause Canada is NASCAR's largest market outside the United States, NASCAR brought the NAPA Auto Parts 200 Busch Series (now Xfinity Series) race to Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in 2007.[37] The race remained on the schedule until being discontinued after the 2012 season. Beginning the next year, NASCAR brought the Camping World Truck Series to Mosport with the Chevrolet Silverado 250.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadians have combined to win 53 races in American Championship Car Racing (Including 1 Indianapolis 500), 17 races in Formula 1 and 7 races in NASCAR's top 3 divisions (1 in the Cup Series).\\r\\n\\r\\nShooting sports are a part of Canada's cultural heritage. Many Canadians enjoy participating in the various disciplines that make up this broad sport.  in the past decade shooting sports in Canada have seen a major surge of popularity as more and more Canadians are applying for firearms licences.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the recreational level individuals and families can be found across the nation improving their marksmanship skills at various private and public shooting ranges. Hunting is also a popular activity due to Canada's vast wilderness and pioneer past.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the competitive level, many Canadians train in Olympic events. There are also a variety of other competitive shooting sports that operate provincially, nationally and internationally through their respective organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor multi-sport events with Canadian participation, or that have taken place in Canada, are the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, Canada Games, World Championships in Athletics, Pan American Games, and the Universiade. Others include the North American Indigenous Games, the World Police and Fire Games, and the Gay Games.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canada Games is a high-level multi-sport event with held every two years in Canada, alternating between the Canada Winter Games and the Canada Summer Games. Athletes are strictly amateur only, and represent their province or territory. Since their inception, the Canada Games have played a prominent role in developing some of Canada's premier athletes, including Lennox Lewis, Catriona Le May Doan, Hayley Wickenheiser, Sidney Crosby, Martin Brodeur, Steve Nash, Suzanne Gaudet and David Ling. The Games were first held in 1967 in Quebec City as part of Canada's Centennial celebrations. Similar events are held on the provincial level, such as the annual BC Games.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada is one of only six nations to have attended every Commonwealth Games, and hosted the first ever British Empire Games in 1930 in Hamilton, Ontario. Canada also hosted the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, and the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia. Canada ranks third in the all-time medal tally of Commonwealth Games.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada has competed at every Olympic Games, except for the first games in 1896 and the boycotted games in 1980. Canada has previously hosted the games three times, at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the summer games, the majority of Canada's medals come from the sports of athletics, aquatics (swimming, synchronized swimming and diving), rowing and canoeing/kayaking. In the post-boycott era (since 1988), Canada's medal total ranks 19th in the world, with the highest rank of 11th in 1992 and the lowest of 24th in 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the winter games, Canada is usually one of the top nations in terms of medals won. Canada is traditionally strong in the sports of ice hockey, speed skating (especially the short track variation), figure skating and every Canadian men's and women's curling teams have won medals since the sport was added to the Olympic program.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Canada failed to win any gold medals at the 1976 Summer and 1988 Winter games, several organizations including Sport Canada and the Canadian Olympic Committee collaborated to launch \\"Own the Podium ÿ 2010\\", a development program to help Canada earn the most medals at the 2010 Games. Canada did not win the most total medals at the Vancouver Olympics (they finished third, behind the United States, whose 37 total medals was the most of any country at a single Winter Olympics, and Germany, with 26), but did win the most gold medals, with 14, the most of any country at a single Winter Olympics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Sport School in Calgary, founded 1994, is the first Canadian high school designed exclusively for Olympic-calibre athletes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada has participated in each of the Pan American Games since the second edition of the games, held in Mexico City in 1955. The fifth games took place in Winnipeg in 1967, Canada's Centennial year. Winnipeg hosted again in 1999. Toronto was selected as the host city for the 2015 games, which was held in July, 2015 in venues located in Toronto and its surrounding municipalities.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian athletes are world-ranked in many amateur sports. These include the 'winter' sports of alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, freestyle skiing, snowboarding, speed skating and biathlon. In ice hockey, Canada supports national teams in under-20 and under-18 categories. In 'summer' sports, Canadians participate in rugby, soccer, disc ultimate, track and field among most sports presented in the Summer Olympics. There are sports federations for most sports in Canada. Funding for amateur athletics is provided by governments, private companies and individual citizens through donation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor television broadcasters of sports in Canada include the CBC Television, Tlvision de Radio-Canada, The Sports Network (TSN), Rseau des sports (RDS), Rogers Sportsnet, and The Score. A consortium led by CTVglobemedia outbid CBC for the broadcast rights to the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics. Major national weekly sports broadcasts include Hockey Night In Canada and Friday Night Football. There are sports radio stations in most major Canadian cities as well as on satellite radio.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Rankings current as of November 2, 2016)","input":"What is canada's most popular spectator sport?"},{"output":"January 26, 2003","context":"Super Bowl XXXVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Oakland Raiders and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2002 season. The Buccaneers defeated the Raiders by the score of 48ÿ21, tied with Super Bowl XXXV for the seventh largest Super Bowl margin of victory, and winning their first ever Super Bowl.[5] The game, played on January 26, 2003 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California, was the sixth Super Bowl to be held a week after the conference championship games (XVII, XXV, XXVIII, XXXIV, and XXXVI). It was also the last Super Bowl played in the month of January.\\r\\nThis was the first Super Bowl in which the league's number one-ranked offense (Raiders) faced the league's number one-ranked defense (Buccaneers). The game sometimes is referred to as the \\"Gruden Bowl\\", because the primary storyline surrounding the game revolved around Jon Gruden. Gruden was the Raiders' head coach from 1998 to 2001, and then became the Buccaneers coach in 2002. Tampa Bay, \\"Gruden's new team\\", made their first Super Bowl appearance in team history after posting a 12ÿ4 regular season record. Oakland, \\"Gruden's old team\\", advanced to their fifth Super Bowl after an 11ÿ5 regular season. Super Bowl XXXVII is also referred to as the \\"Pirate Bowl\\", due to both teams' pirate-themed names.[6]\\r\\nThe Raiders came into the game as four-point favorites. However, the Tampa Bay defense dominated the contest. Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon threw a Super Bowl record five interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns. The Buccaneers also sacked Gannon five times, and scored 34 consecutive points to build a 34ÿ3 lead late in the third quarter. Tampa Bay safety Dexter Jackson, who had two of those interceptions and returned them for 34 yards, was named Super Bowl MVP. Jackson became only the second safety and third defensive back named Super Bowl MVP.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSuper Bowl XXXVII was originally awarded to San Francisco on October 15, 1997 by the NFL owners at a league meeting in Washington, D.C.[7] The 49ers had recently announced plans for a new stadium, and were awarded the Super Bowl contingent on its completion. However, the stadium plans had stalled by the fall of 1998 and the NFL reopened the bidding for the game. San Diego, which had lost out on Super Bowl XXXVI,[8] announced its interest. The city was awarded the game during the May 26, 1999 meeting at Atlanta. Miami was the only other city in consideration.[9] It was the last Super Bowl played in California until Super Bowl 50 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. It was the also the final Super Bowl at Qualcomm Stadium before the Chargers relocated to Los Angeles in 2017.\\r\\nLater in 2003, California would host the Stanley Cup Finals with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim hosting games 3, 4, and 6, making it only the second time that the same state hosted both the Super Bowl and the Stanley Cup Finals in the same year,[10] following California itself ten years earlier, when the Los Angeles Kings went to the Finals four months after Pasadena hosted Super Bowl XXVII. It was then succeeded by itself again in 2016 when Super Bowl 50 took place in San Francisco and the San Jose Sharks made the Stanley Cup Finals.\\r\\nAfter moving back to Oakland, California in 1995, the Raiders suffered sub-par seasons, including a 4ÿ12 record in 1997. Under Gruden's leadership, the Raiders improved to 8ÿ8 in both 1998 and 1999. The team was further boosted in 1999 with the signing of veteran quarterback Rich Gannon. With Gannon as quarterback, the team jumped to the fifth-best offense in the league.\\r\\nThe Raiders won the AFC West in 2000 with a 12ÿ4 record and the best rushing offense in the league. However, they lost the AFC Championship Game to the eventual Super Bowl XXXV champion Baltimore Ravens, 16ÿ3. After signing veteran Pro Bowl wide receiver Jerry Rice and defensive tackle Trace Armstrong, the team repeated as AFC West champions in 2001, but were eliminated in the AFC Divisional Game by the eventual Super Bowl XXXVI champion New England Patriots in what became known as the \\"Tuck Rule Game\\", in which a potential game-ending fumble recovery by the Raiders was overturned by instant replay.\\r\\nRaiders owner Al Davis was known to have the lowest salaries for coaches in the league, and Gruden was no exception. Instead of paying a high salary for Gruden, Davis opted to trade the rights for Gruden to the Buccaneers in exchange for four draft picks, in a deal similar to what Patriots owner Robert Kraft made with the New York Jets to get head coach Bill Belichick in 2000. The Buccaneers ended up giving two first-round picks, two second-round picks and $8 million to the Raiders to get Gruden. Tampa Bay was desperate to have someone rebuild their offense so it would complement their powerful defense in an attempt to win the Super Bowl.\\r\\nFor most of their history, the Buccaneers were regarded as losers, making the playoffs only three times in their first 20 seasons. But that changed when the team hired Tony Dungy as head coach in 1996. Dungy, along with his defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, rebuilt the defense around a core group of players, such as defensive lineman Warren Sapp, linebacker Derrick Brooks, and defensive backs Ronde Barber and John Lynch. By 1997, Tampa Bay ranked 3rd in the league in total yards allowed, 2nd in 1998, and 3rd in 2000.\\r\\nWith one of the best defenses in the league, Dungy helped guide the Buccaneers to four playoff appearances in his six years as the team's head coach. But the team always had one of the worst offenses in the league, and this was a major factor in their playoff losses. Thus, Dungy was fired and replaced by Gruden.\\r\\nStill, even Gruden had trouble getting the offense in sync during his first year as Tampa Bay's head coach. In 2002, the Buccaneers ranked 25th in the league in total yards gained (5,222). Quarterback Brad Johnson made the Pro Bowl, completing 281 out of 451 passes for 3,049 yards, 22 touchdowns, and only 6 interceptions. Running back Michael Pittman led the team in rushing with 718 yards and one touchdown, and caught 59 passes for 477 yards. Pro Bowl fullback Mike Alstott had 548 rushing yards and 5 touchdowns, and also had 35 receptions for 242 yards and 2 touchdowns. Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson led the team with 76 receptions for 1,088 yards and 5 touchdowns, while wide receiver Keenan McCardell had 61 receptions for 670 yards and 6 touchdowns.\\r\\nHowever, the Buccaneers' defense was still the strength of the team, leading the NFL in total defense (252.8 yards per game), pass defense (155.6 yards per game), points allowed (12.3 points per game), passing touchdowns allowed (10), interceptions (31), and opponent passer rating (48.4). Brooks, Lynch, Sapp, and defensive end Simeon Rice all had Pro Bowl years. Brooks led the team with 87 tackles and excelled at pass coverage, recording 5 interceptions, 218 return yards, and 2 touchdowns, plus 1 fumble return and 1 on a lateral from Sapp after a Sapp interception for a total of 4 touchdowns (an NFL record for a linebacker). The defense as a whole had nine total touchdowns during the regular season and playoffs. Rice led the team with 15.5 sacks. Sapp recorded 7.5 sacks and 2 interceptions. Cornerback Brian Kelly was also a big asset, leading the team with 8 interceptions.\\r\\nDespite the loss of Gruden in 2002, the Raiders under their new coach Bill Callahan still managed to earn a share of the AFC's best record at 11ÿ5. The offense led the league in total passing yards (4,689) and ranked second in total yards gained (6,451).\\r\\nGannon had a Pro Bowl season, completing 418 out of 618 passes for 4,689 yards, 26 touchdowns, and with 10 interceptions. His 418 completions and his 10 games with over 300 passing yards were both NFL records. He also ran 50 times for 156 yards and 3 touchdowns. Rice, who was already the NFL's all-time leader in nearly every receiving record after 17 seasons, had a Pro Bowl season for the 13th time in his career with 92 receptions for 1,211 yards and 7 touchdowns. Gannon's other weapons in passing game were 15-year veteran receiver Tim Brown (81 receptions for 930 yards and 2 touchdowns) and young receiver Jerry Porter (51 receptions for 688 yards and 9 touchdowns). Multi-talented running back Charlie Garner was the team's leading rusher with 962 yards and 7 touchdowns, while also leading all NFL running backs in receiving with 91 receptions for 941 yards and another 4 touchdowns. Running back Tyrone Wheatley was also a big contributor with 419 rushing yards and 71 receiving yards, while fullback Zack Crockett provided both of them with solid blocking and scored 8 touchdowns. Up front, their offensive line was led by 2 Pro Bowlers, guard Lincoln Kennedy and center Barret Robbins.\\r\\nThe Raiders' weakness was primarily on their defense, which ranked 25th in the league in passing yards allowed (3,787) and 12th in total yards (5,240). But veteran Pro Bowl safety Rod Woodson recorded 8 interceptions (which led the league) for 225 yards and 2 touchdowns. Up front, their line was anchored by defensive tackle Rod Coleman, who led the team with 11 sacks. Behind him, the team had a solid veteran linebacker, Bill Romanowski, who was playing in his 5th Super Bowl (after winning 2 championships with the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV, and 2 while playing for the Denver Broncos in Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII). Defensive back Tory James was also a big contributor with 4 interceptions.\\r\\nThe second-seeded Buccaneers defeated the fourth-seeded San Francisco 49ers, 31ÿ6, and the top-seeded Philadelphia Eagles on the road, 27ÿ10, in the playoffs, to make the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history.[11] Meanwhile, the top-seeded Raiders were victorious against the fourth-seeded New York Jets, 30ÿ10,[12] and the second-seeded Tennessee Titans, 41ÿ24.[13] The Raiders won against the Titans through Gannon's pass-oriented offense.[13]\\r\\nThe Raiders entered the game favored to win in their first Super Bowl in 19 years. They were also the first franchise to appear in the Super Bowl in four different decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 2000s; the 1990s was the only decade that they didn't appear in the Super Bowl). However, much of the media hype surrounded the Gruden trade prior to the season. This forced league commissioner Paul Tagliabue to issue a statement that he might ban all future trades for coaches involving draft choices because it might compromise the draft.[14]\\r\\nA distraction for the Raiders was that starting center Barret Robbins went missing for most of the week leading up to the Super Bowl, and ended up in a San Diego hospital the night before the game after suffering a manic episode.[15] Backup Adam Treu (a former Pro Bowl-er) replaced Robbins.\\r\\nThe game was broadcast in the United States by ABC with Al Michaels handling the play-by-play duties and color commentator John Madden, who became the first person to announce Super Bowls on different networks in consecutive years, having called Super Bowl XXXVI on Fox and then moving to ABC after Pat Summerall retired.\\r\\nThe NFC improved to 6ÿ0 on Super Bowls broadcast on ABC. Melissa Stark and Lynn Swann served as sideline reporters. Chris Berman from Disney-owned corporate sibling ESPN hosted all the events. Berman was joined by fellow ESPN analyst Steve Young, Baltimore Ravens head coach Brian Billick, and New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan.\\r\\nThe Super Bowl was the first of three major professional sports championship series ABC broadcast in 2003, as they would also broadcast the Stanley Cup Finals and the NBA Finals. Both the Super Bowl and the Stanley Cup Finals were hosted by Berman (who co-hosted the Stanley Cup Finals with John Saunders) and took place in the state of California.[10] The state of California had representation in both finals series.[10] Gary Thorne, Bill Clement, and John Davidson mentioned all of these when they called the Stanley Cup Finals.[10]\\r\\nBefore the game, a show called \\"Santana and Friends\\" performed on the field. Carlos Santana was joined by Beyonc and Michelle Branch and sang truncated versions of \\"Oye Como Va\\", \\"The Game of Love\\", and \\"Foo Foo.\\" ABC also aired a pre-game parking lot performance featuring Bonnie Raitt, Goo Goo Dolls and Michael Bubl prior to the Santana and Friends segment.[16]\\r\\nIn a nod to what the New England Patriots did the previous year in Super Bowl XXXVI, both teams were introduced as a team, rather than individually by offensive and defensive starters, after highlights of their seasons were simulcast on the video boards in the stadium and on television. This has become a regular tradition starting with this Super Bowl.\\r\\nCeline Dion then sang \\"God Bless America\\" which is sung for the only time in the Super Bowl, and later the Dixie Chicks sang the national anthem, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". F/A-18 Super Hornets of the United States Navy performed a flyover.[17]\\r\\nTo honor the 30th anniversary of the 17ÿ0 undefeated, perfect season of the 1972 Miami Dolphins, the following members of that team appeared during the coin toss ceremony: Don Shula, Bob Griese, Larry Csonka, Larry Little, Jim Langer, Nick Buoniconti, Paul Warfield.\\r\\nMemorable television commercials that aired during the game included the \\"Terry Tate: Office Linebacker\\" Reebok ad and the Budweiser Zebra Referee. ADBOWL ranked FedEx's \\"Castaway\\" as the best commercial of the year.\\r\\nShania Twain, No Doubt, and Sting were featured during the halftime show, which was sponsored by AT&T Wireless. Twain sang her hits \\"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\\" and \\"Up!\\".\\r\\nNo Doubt then sang their hit \\"Just a Girl\\" with lead singer Gwen Stefani ad-libbing lines like \\"I'm just a girl at the Super Bowl!\\" The show concluded with Sting performing \\"Message in a Bottle\\", with Stefani joining in midway through.[18]\\r\\nNBC provided counter-programming against the halftime show, airing a live segment of \\"Weekend Update\\" from the comedyÿvariety show Saturday Night Live featuring Jimmy Fallon and Tina Fey.\\r\\nBon Jovi appeared as part of the post-game ceremonies, performing \\"It's My Life\\" prior to the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation and \\"Everyday\\" afterwards (most of the latter performance was not shown on ABC because the network cut to commercials).\\r\\nThe Raiders had a great chance to score a touchdown early in the game after cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Buccaneers quarterback Brad Johnson's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 12 yards to the Tampa Bay 36-yard line. However, six plays later, Tampa Bay defensive end Simeon Rice sacked Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon on third down, forcing Oakland to settle for kicker Sebastian Janikowski's 40-yard field goal to give them a 3ÿ0 lead.[19]\\r\\nBuccaneers kick returner Aaron Stecker returned the ensuing kickoff 27 yards to the 29-yard line, then appeared to fumble the ball. Although the officials initially ruled that the ball was recovered by Oakland's Eric Johnson, the play was reviewed by instant replay and the fumble was overturned, and thus Tampa Bay retained possession. It showed that both of Stecker's knees were down and the ball didn't come loose until it hit the ground. Gruden and Stecker appeared upset at having to use a challenge so early in a game, when they both believed Stecker was clearly down.\\r\\nOn the first play of the drive, Brad Johnson completed an 11-yard pass to wide receiver Joe Jurevicius. Johnson's next 2 passes were incomplete, but he then completed a 23-yard pass to Jurevicius on third down to advance the ball to the Oakland 37-yard line. Running back Michael Pittman then rushed for a 23-yard gain to the 13-yard line. However, on the next 3 plays, the Raiders defense limited the Buccaneers to a pair of incompletions and a 1-yard run. Argentine kicker Martn Gramtica then made a 31-yard field goal to tie the game, 3ÿ3.\\r\\nLater in the half, a 17-yard punt return by Raiders defensive back Darrien Gordon gave Oakland the ball at their own 49-yard line. Gannon then threw an 8-yard pass to running back Charlie Garner to reach the Tampa Bay 43-yard line. However, on third down, Buccaneers safety Dexter Jackson intercepted Gannon's pass at the 40-yard line and returned it 9-yards to near midfield. Then nine plays after the turnover, Gramatica kicked his second field goal from 43 yards to give Tampa Bay a 6ÿ3 lead.\\r\\nJackson intercepted another pass on the Raiders' next drive and returned it 25 yards to Oakland's 45-yard line, making Jackson the first player ever to record two interceptions in the first half of the Super Bowl. However, the Buccaneers were unable to take advantage of the turnover and were forced to punt. Fortunately for Tampa Bay, they got a big assist from their punter Tom Tupa, who managed to pin Oakland all the way back at their own 11-yard line with his punt. The Raiders could not move the ball either, losing 1 yard on 3 plays with their ensuing drive. Tampa Bay punt returner Karl Williams then returned Shane Lechler's punt 25 yards, giving the Buccaneers great field position at Oakland's 27-yard line. Aided with Pittman's gains of 6 and 19 yards, the Buccaneers scored their first touchdown on a 2-yard run from fullback Mike Alstott, increasing their lead to 13ÿ3. Then with 3:45 left in the half, Tampa Bay drove 77 yards, assisted by a pair of catches by Alstott for 28 total yards. Johnson finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Keenan McCardell to give the Buccaneers a 20ÿ3 halftime lead.\\r\\nTampa Bay continued to dominate the game for most of the third quarter. The Buccaneers forced the Raiders to punt on the opening drive of the second half. Next, Tampa Bay marched 89 yards on a 14-play drive that took 7:52 off the clock, and ended with Johnson's 8-yard touchdown pass to McCardell to increase their lead to 27ÿ3. Then on the second play of Oakland's ensuing drive, Buccaneers defensive back Dwight Smith intercepted Gannon's pass and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown, making the score 34ÿ3.[20]\\r\\nAfter giving up 34 points, Oakland finally managed to drive 82 yards down the field and score on a 39-yard touchdown pass from Gannon to wide receiver Jerry Porter. Although he was initially ruled as being out of bounds when he caught the ball, it was determined that Porter had both feet in the end zone.[21] The two-point conversion failed, so the Raiders were still down 34ÿ9.\\r\\nThe Raiders' touchdown seemed to fire up their defense, who forced the Buccaneers to a fourth down on their ensuing possession. Oakland linebacker Tim Johnson then blocked Tupa's punt, and linebacker Eric Johnson returned the ball 13 yards for a touchdown. Another two-point conversion for Oakland failed, but Tampa Bay's lead was cut to 34ÿ15.[20]\\r\\nTampa Bay responded by moving the ball to the Oakland 9-yard line on their ensuing drive, featuring a 24-yard run by Pittman, but they came up empty after Tupa fumbled the snap on a field goal attempt. A few plays later, Gannon threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerry Rice with 6:06 left in the game, cutting the Raiders deficit to 34ÿ21. The two-point conversion failed when Jerry Porter caught the ball but landed out of bounds. Though there was contact with a defender, the officials deemed the contact incidental rather than a force-out, and therefore that part of the play was non-reviewable.[22]\\r\\nIn an attempt to prevent a Raiders comeback, the Buccaneers managed to run the clock down to 2:44 on their ensuing drive before being forced to punt. Then on third and 18 from the Oakland 29-yard line, Tampa Bay linebacker Derrick Brooks intercepted a pass from Gannon and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown, giving the Buccaneers a 41ÿ21 lead with only 1:18 left, and leading Buccaneers radio announcer Gene Deckerhoff to make his famous call of \\"The dagger's in, we're gonna win the Super Bowl!\\".[20] A few plays later, with the Raiders now playing for pride, Dwight Smith intercepted a tipped pass and returned it 50 yards for a touchdown with only two seconds remaining. Gramatica kicked the extra point, and the Buccaneers were up 48ÿ21.[22] Raiders defensive tackle Chris Cooper returned Gramatica's kickoff 6 yards before being tackled by Jack Golden, ending the game.[20] The Buccaneers won their first-ever Super Bowl with a 48-21 victory. Gannon said after the game that his performance was \\"nightmarish\\".[19]\\r\\nat Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego, California\\r\\nTampa Bay dominated Oakland, outgaining them in total yards (365 to 269), rushing yards (150 to 19), first downs (24 to 11), offensive plays (76 to 60), and forced turnovers (5 to 1). As many sports fans and writers predicted, Gruden's prior knowledge of the Raiders was a major factor. The most damaging piece of evidence is NFL Films footage of Tampa Bay defensive back John Lynch telling his teammates during the game that almost all of the plays ran by Oakland's offense were plays that Gruden (who that week even played the part of \\"Rich Gannon\\" by playing QB with the scout-team offense) specifically told them to look out for.[24] Better still for the Buccaneers was that Oakland hadn't changed their audible-calling signals that Gruden himself had installed, thus tipping off plays repeatedly.\\r\\nJohnson finished the game with 18 out of 34 completions for 215 yards and 2 touchdowns, with 1 interception, along with 10 rushing yards. Pittman was the top rusher of the game with 129 yards. Alstott was the game's second leading rusher with 15 yards and a touchdown, and had 5 receptions for 43 yards. Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson was the Buccaneers' leading receiver with 6 catches for 69 yards. Smith recorded 2 interceptions, 94 return yards, and 2 touchdowns. He also added another 23 yards on a kickoff return.\\r\\nGannon finished the game 24 out of 44 for 272 yards and 2 touchdowns, but was intercepted a Super Bowl record 5 times. Garner was their leading rusher, but with only 10 yards, and caught 7 passes for 51 yards. Rice was the Raiders' leading receiver of the game with 5 catches for 77 yards and a touchdown. He became the first player to score touchdowns with two different teams in Super Bowls (Ricky Proehl and Muhsin Muhammad have since joined him). Wide receiver Marcus Knight returned 8 kickoffs for 143 yards.\\r\\nJerry Rice and Bill Romanowski joined Gene Upshaw as the only players to appear in Super Bowls in three different decades. Rice played in Super Bowls XXIII, XXIV, and XXIX. Romanowski played in Super Bowls XXIII, XXIV, XXXII, and XXXIII; the Raiders' loss prevented Romanowski from joining Charles Haley as the only NFL players at that time to earn 5 Super Bowl rings (Haley was also with the 49ers for Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV, and later earned rings when the Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowls XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX). The Raiders became the first team to appear in Super Bowls under four different head coaches. John Rauch coached them in Super Bowl II, John Madden (who himself called Super Bowl XXXVII on ABC), coached them in Super Bowl XI and Tom Flores coached them in Super Bowl XV and XVIII.\\r\\nThe teams combined for the most second half points in a Super Bowl with 46 (28 for Tampa Bay and 18 for Oakland) and the third most total points in a game with 69, tying Dallas and Buffalo who combined for 69 points in Super Bowl XXVII.\\r\\nSources: NFL.com Super Bowl XXXVII, Super Bowl XXXVII Play Finder TB, Super Bowl XXXVII Play Finder Oak, Super Bowl XXXVII Play by Play\\r\\n1Completions/attempts 2Carries 3Long gain 4Receptions 5Times targeted\\r\\nSource:[25]\\r\\nHall of Fame?\\r\\nIn Oakland, after the Raiders' loss, riots broke out on the streets of East Oakland.

The 30-minute series was created by David Levy and Donald Saltzman and shot in black-and-white, airing for two seasons on ABC from September 18, 1964, to April 8, 1966 for a total of 64 episodes. It is often compared to its CBS rival, The Munsters, which ran for the same two seasons and achieved somewhat higher Nielsen ratings.[2] The show is also notable for its opening theme that was composed by Vic Mizzy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was originally produced by head writer Nat Perrin for Filmways, Inc. at General Service Studios in Hollywood, California. Successor company MGM Television (via The Program Exchange for broadcast syndication and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment for home video/DVD) now owns the rights to the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Addamses are a close-knit extended family with decidedly macabre interests and supernatural abilities, though no explanation for their powers is explicitly given in the series. The wealthy, endlessly enthusiastic Gomez Addams (John Astin) is madly in love with his refined wife, Morticia (Carolyn Jones). Along with their daughter Wednesday (Lisa Loring), their son Pugsley (Ken Weatherwax), Uncle Fester (Jackie Coogan), and Grandmama (Blossom Rock), they reside at 0001 Cemetery Lane in an ornate, gloomy, Second Empire-style mansion, attended by their servants: Lurch (Ted Cassidy), the towering butler, and Thing, a\\r\\ndisembodied hand that appears from within a small wooden box. Other relatives who made recurring appearances included Cousin Itt (Felix Silla), Morticia's older sister Ophelia (also portrayed by Jones), and Morticia's mother Grandma Frump (Margaret Hamilton). Many guest stars mainly famous during the era came in the show playing a cameo part, as the script permitted (example, a truant officer, insurance man etc.)[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the humor derives from the Addamses' culture clash with the rest of the world. They invariably treat normal visitors with great warmth and courtesy, unaware that some of their guests often have bad intentions. They are puzzled by the horrified reactions to their own good-natured and normal behavior, since the family is under the impression that their tastes are shared by most of society. Accordingly, they view \\"conventional\\" tastes with generally tolerant suspicion. Invariably, as a result of their visit to the Addamses, a visitor would be institutionalized, change professions, move out of the country or suffer some other negative life-changing event.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeries creator David Levy explained the premise of the show to syndicated columnist Erskine Johnson in August 1964: \\"We have made [the family] full-bodied people, not monsters ... They are not grotesque and hideous manifestations. At the same time we are protecting the images of [Charles] Addams' 'children', as he refers to them. We are living up to the spirit of his cartoons. He is more than just a cartoonist. He's a social commentator and a great wit.\\"[7] The tone was set by series producer Nat Perrin, who was a close friend of Groucho Marx and writer of several Marx Brothers films. Perrin created story ideas, directed one episode and rewrote every script. The series often employed the same type of zany satire and screwball humor seen in the Marx Brothers films. It lampooned politics (\\"Gomez, The Politician\\" and \\"Gomez, The People's Choice\\"), the legal system (\\"The Addams Family in Court\\"), rock n' roll and Beatlemania (\\"Lurch, The Teenage Idol\\") and Hollywood (\\"My Fair Cousin Itt\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show's memorable theme, written and arranged by longtime Hollywood composer Vic Mizzy, was dominated by a harpsichord with finger snaps as percussive accompaniment. Ted Cassidy punctuated the lyrics with the words \\"neat\\", \\"sweet\\" and \\"petite\\". Mizzy's theme was popular enough to enjoy a release as a 45-rpm single, though it failed to make the U.S. charts. The song was revived for the 1992 animated series, as well as in 2007 for a series of Addams Family television commercials for M&M's chocolates.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor both seasons, episodes aired Friday nights at 8:30?p.m.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show has been aired worldwide. In the United Kingdom, it first aired on ITV in 1965ÿ1966, and then it appeared on Sky 1 in 1991 and ran until 1992. and then it was aired on BBC Two from 6 p.m. on Monday nights starting in February 1992 until the end of 1993 and then moved to Saturdays in 1994 and later in school summer holidays before it vanished at the end of August 1996.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince October 2011, the series was picked up by Cartoon Network's sister channel Boomerang and runs through the entire month of October for Halloween alongside The Munsters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series airs on select local stations,[8] and as of November 2013 airs weekends on the national movie/classic TV network Antenna TV[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nA reunion TV film, Halloween with the New Addams Family, aired on NBC in October 1977 and starred most of the original cast, except for Blossom Rock, who was very ill at the time and was replaced as Grandmama by Phyllis actress Jane Rose. Elvia Allman portrayed Mother Frump, whom Margaret Hamilton had played in the original series. Veteran character actors Parley Baer and Vito Scotti, who both had recurring roles in the original series, also appeared in the movie. The film also included extended family members created specifically for this production, such as Gomez's brother Pancho (played by Henry Darrow) and two additional children, Wednesday Jr. and Pugsley Jr.  The latter two were portrayed as near copies of the original children, now known as Wednesday Sr. and Pugsley Sr., who were once again played respectively by Lisa Loring and Ken Weatherwax, the original Wednesday and Pugsley in the series. Vic Mizzy rewrote and conducted the series theme as an instrumental.\\r\\n\\r\\nAstin reprised his role as Gomez Addams for the 1992 animated adaptation of the series. No other members of the original cast were involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, a standalone film, Addams Family Reunion, aired on the Fox Family Channel, followed by the series The New Addams Family that ran from 1998 to 2000.

A sequel, Addams Family Values, followed in 1993, to greater critical success than the first film, though it earned less at the box office.","input":"When did the addams family first air on tv?"},{"output":"temples","context":"The architecture of ancient Greece is the architecture produced by the Greek-speaking people (Hellenic people) whose culture flourished on the Greek mainland, the Peloponnese, the Aegean Islands, and in colonies in Anatolia and Italy for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC.[1]\\r\\nAncient Greek architecture is best known from its temples, many of which are found throughout the region, mostly as ruins but many substantially intact. The second important type of building that survives all over the Hellenic world is the open-air theatre, with the earliest dating from around 525-480 BC. Other architectural forms that are still in evidence are the processional gateway (propylon), the public square (agora) surrounded by storied colonnade (stoa), the town council building (bouleuterion), the public monument, the monumental tomb (mausoleum) and the stadium.\\r\\nAncient Greek architecture is distinguished by its highly formalised characteristics, both of structure and decoration. This is particularly so in the case of temples where each building appears to have been conceived as a sculptural entity within the landscape, most often raised on high ground so that the elegance of its proportions and the effects of light on its surfaces might be viewed from all angles.[2] Nikolaus Pevsner refers to \\"the plastic shape of the [Greek] temple.....placed before us with a physical presence more intense, more alive than that of any later building\\".[3]\\r\\nThe formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the Doric Order, the Ionic Order and the Corinthian Order, was to have profound effect on Western architecture of later periods. The architecture of ancient Rome grew out of that of Greece and maintained its influence in Italy unbroken until the present day. From the Renaissance, revivals of Classicism have kept alive not only the precise forms and ordered details of Greek architecture, but also its concept of architectural beauty based on balance and proportion. The successive styles of Neoclassical architecture and Greek Revival architecture followed and adapted Ancient Greek styles closely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mainland and islands of Greece are rocky, with deeply indented coastline, and rugged mountain ranges with few substantial forests. The most freely available building material is stone. Limestone was readily available and easily worked.[4] There is an abundance of high quality white marble both on the mainland and islands, particularly Paros and Naxos. This finely grained material was a major contributing factor to precision of detail, both architectural and sculptural, that adorned ancient Greek architecture.[5] Deposits of high quality potter's clay were found throughout Greece and the Islands, with major deposits near Athens. It was used not only for pottery vessels, but also roof tiles and architectural decoration.[6]\\r\\nThe climate of Greece is maritime, with both the coldness of winter and the heat of summer tempered by sea breezes. This led to a lifestyle where many activities took place outdoors. Hence temples were placed on hilltops, their exteriors designed as a visual focus of gatherings and processions, while theatres were often an enhancement of a naturally occurring sloping site where people could sit, rather than a containing structure. Colonnades encircling buildings, or surrounding courtyards provided shelter from the sun and from sudden winter storms.[5]\\r\\nThe light of Greece may be another important factor in the development of the particular character of ancient Greek architecture. The light is often extremely bright, with both the sky and the sea vividly blue. The clear light and sharp shadows give a precision to the details of landscape, pale rocky outcrops and seashore. This clarity is alternated with periods of haze that varies in colour to the light on it. In this characteristic environment, the ancient Greek architects constructed buildings that were marked by precision of detail.[5] The gleaming marble surfaces were smooth, curved, fluted, or ornately sculpted to reflect the sun, cast graded shadows and change in colour with the ever-changing light of day.\\r\\nHistorians divide ancient Greek civilization into two eras, the Hellenic period (from around 900 BC to the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC), and the Hellenistic period (323 BC to 30 AD).[7] During the earlier Hellenic period, substantial works of architecture began to appear around 600 BC. During the later (Hellenistic) period, Greek culture spread widely, initially as a result of Alexander's conquest of other lands, and later as a result of the rise of the Roman Empire, which adopted much of Greek culture.[1][8]\\r\\nBefore the Hellenic era, two major cultures had dominated the region: the Minoan (c. 2800ÿ1100 BC), and the Mycenaean (c. 1500ÿ1100 BC). Minoan is the name given by modern historians to the culture of the people of ancient Crete, known for its elaborate and richly decorated palaces, and for its pottery painted with floral and marine motifs. The Mycenaean culture, which flourished on the Peloponnesus, was quite different in character. Its people built citadels, fortifications and tombs rather than palaces, and decorated their pottery with bands of marching soldiers rather than octopus and seaweed. Both these civilizations came to an end around 1100 BC, that of Crete possibly because of volcanic devastation, and that of Mycenae because of an invasion by the Dorian people who lived on the Greek mainland.[9] Following these events, there was a period from which few signs of culture remain. This period is thus often referred to as a Dark Age.\\r\\nThe art history of the Hellenic era is generally subdivided into four periods: the Protogeometric (1100ÿ900 BC), the Geometric (900ÿ700 BC), the Archaic (700 ÿ 500 BC) and the Classical (500 ÿ 323 BC)[10] with sculpture being further divided into Severe Classical, High Classical and Late Classical.[1] The first signs of the particular artistic character that defines ancient Greek architecture are to be seen in the pottery of the Dorian Greeks from the 10th century BC. Already at this period it is created with a sense of proportion, symmetry and balance not apparent in similar pottery from Crete and Mycenae. The decoration is precisely geometric, and ordered neatly into zones on defined areas of each vessel. These qualities were to manifest themselves not only through a millennium of Greek pottery making, but also in the architecture that was to emerge in the 6th century.[11] The major development that occurred was in the growing use of the human figure as the major decorative motif, and the increasing surety with which humanity, its mythology, activities and passions were depicted.[1]\\r\\nThe development in the depiction of the human form in pottery was accompanied by a similar development in sculpture. The tiny stylised bronzes of the Geometric period gave way to life-sized highly formalised monolithic representation in the Archaic period. The Classical period was marked by a rapid development towards idealised but increasingly lifelike depictions of gods in human form.[12] This development had a direct effect on the sculptural decoration of temples, as many of the greatest extant works of ancient Greek sculpture once adorned temples,[13] and many of the largest recorded statues of the age, such as the lost chryselephantine statues of Zeus at the Temple of Zeus at Olympia and Athena at the Parthenon, Athens, both over 40 feet high, were once housed in them.[14]\\r\\nThe religion of ancient Greece was a form of nature worship that grew out of the beliefs of earlier cultures. However, unlike earlier cultures, man was no longer perceived as being threatened by nature, but as its sublime product.[8] The natural elements were personified as gods of completely human form, and very human behaviour.[5]\\r\\nThe home of the gods was thought to be Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece. The most important deities were: Zeus, the supreme god and ruler of the sky; Hera, his wife and goddess of marriage; Athena, goddess of wisdom; Poseidon, god of the sea; Demeter, goddess of the harvest; Apollo, god of the sun, law, healing, plague, reason, music and poetry; Artemis, goddess of the moon, the hunt and the wilderness; Aphrodite, goddess of love; Ares, God of war; Hermes, god of commerce and travelers, Hephaestus, god of fire and metalwork, and Dionysus, god of wine and fruit-bearing plants.[5] Worship, like many other activities, was done in community, in the open. However, by 600 BC, the gods were often represented by large statues and it was necessary to provide a building in which each of these could be housed. This led to the development of temples.[15]\\r\\nThe ancient Greeks perceived order in the universe, and in turn, applied order and reason to their creations. Their humanist philosophy put mankind at the centre of things, and promoted well-ordered societies and the development of democracy.[8] At the same time, the respect for human intellect demanded reason, and promoted a passion for enquiry, logic, challenge, and problem solving. The architecture of the ancient Greeks, and in particular, temple architecture, responds to these challenges with a passion for beauty, and for order and symmetry which is the product of a continual search for perfection, rather than a simple application of a set of working rules.\\r\\nThere is a clear division between the architecture of the preceding Mycenaean culture and Minoan cultures and that of the ancient Greeks, the techniques and an understanding of their style being lost when these civilisations fell.[4]\\r\\nMycenaean art is marked by its circular structures and tapered domes with flat-bedded, cantilevered courses.[9] This architectural form did not carry over into the architecture of ancient Greece, but reappeared about 400 BC in the interior of large monumental tombs such as the Lion Tomb at Cnidos (c. 350 BC). Little is known of Mycenaean wooden or domestic architecture and any continuing traditions that may have flowed into the early buildings of the Dorian people.\\r\\nThe Minoan architecture of Crete, was of trabeated form like that of ancient Greece. It employed wooden columns with capitals, but the columns were of very different form to Doric columns, being narrow at the base and splaying upward.[9] The earliest forms of columns in Greece seem to have developed independently. As with Minoan architecture, ancient Greek domestic architecture centred on open spaces or courtyards surrounded by colonnades. This form was adapted to the construction of hypostyle halls within the larger temples. The evolution that occurred in architecture was towards public building, first and foremost the temple, rather than towards grand domestic architecture such as had evolved in Crete.[2]\\r\\nThe Greek word for the family or household, oikos, is also the name for the house. Houses followed several different types. It is probable that many of the earliest houses were simple structures of two rooms, with an open porch or \\"pronaos\\" above which rose a low pitched gable or pediment.[7] This form is thought to have contributed to temple architecture.\\r\\nThe construction of many houses employed walls of sun dried clay bricks or wooden framework filled with fibrous material such as straw or seaweed covered with clay or plaster, on a base of stone which protected the more vulnerable elements from damp.[4] The roofs were probably of thatch with eaves which overhung the permeable walls. Many larger houses, such as those at Delos, were built of stone and plastered. The roofing material for substantial house was tile. Houses of the wealthy had mosaic floors and demonstrated the Classical style.\\r\\nMany houses centred on a wide passage or \\"pasta\\" which ran the length of the house and opened at one side onto a small courtyard which admitted light and air. Larger houses had a fully developed peristyle courtyard at the centre, with the rooms arranged around it. Some houses had an upper floor which appears to have been reserved for the use of the women of the family.[16]\\r\\nCity houses were built with adjoining walls and were divided into small blocks by narrow streets. Shops were sometimes located in the rooms towards the street. City houses were inward-facing, with major openings looking onto the central courtyard, rather than the street.[7]\\r\\nThe rectangular temple is the most common and best-known form of Greek public architecture. This rectilinear structure borrows from the Late Helladic, Mycenaean Megaron, which contained a central throne room, vestibule, and porch.[17] The temple did not serve the same function as a modern church, since the altar stood under the open sky in the temenos or sacred precinct, often directly before the temple. Temples served as the location of a cult image and as a storage place or strong room for the treasury associated with the cult of the god in question, and as a place for devotees of the god to leave their votive offerings, such as statues, helmets and weapons. Some Greek temples appear to have been oriented astronomically.[18] The temple was generally part of a religious precinct known as the acropolis. According to Aristotle, '\\"the site should be a spot seen far and wide, which gives good elevation to virtue and towers over the neighbourhood\\".[2] Small circular temples, tholos were also constructed, as well as small temple-like buildings that served as treasuries for specific groups of donors.[19]\\r\\nDuring the late 5th and 4th centuries BC, town planning became an important consideration of Greek builders, with towns such as Paestum and Priene being laid out with a regular grid of paved streets and an agora or central market place surrounded by a colonnade or stoa. The completely restored Stoa of Attalos can be seen in Athens. Towns were also equipped with a public fountain where water could be collected for household use. The development of regular town plans is associated with Hippodamus of Miletus, a pupil of Pythagoras.[20][21][22]\\r\\nPublic buildings became \\"dignified and gracious structures\\", and were sited so that they related to each other architecturally.[21] The propylon or porch, formed the entrance to temple sanctuaries and other significant sites with the best-surviving example being the Propylaea on the Acropolis of Athens. The bouleuterion was a large public building with a hypostyle hall that served as a court house and as a meeting place for the town council (boule). Remnants of bouleuterion survive at Athens, Olympia and Miletus, the latter having held up to 1200 people.[23]\\r\\nEvery Greek town had an open-air theatre. These were used for both public meetings as well as dramatic performances. The theatre was usually set in a hillside outside the town, and had rows of tiered seating set in a semicircle around the central performance area, the orchestra. Behind the orchestra was a low building called the skn, which served as a store-room, a dressing-room, and also as a backdrop to the action taking place in the orchestra. A number of Greek theatres survive almost intact, the best known being at Epidaurus, by the architect Polykleitos the Younger.[20]\\r\\nGreek towns of substantial size also had a palaestra or a gymnasium, the social centre for male citizens which included spectator areas, baths, toilets and club rooms.[23] Other buildings associated with sports include the hippodrome for horse racing, of which only remnants have survived, and the stadium for foot racing, 600 feet in length, of which examples exist at Olympia, Delphi, Epidarus and Ephesus, while the Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, which seats 45,000 people, was restored in the 19th century and was used in the 1896, 1906 and 2004 Olympic Games.[23][24]\\r\\nThe architecture of ancient Greece is of a trabeated or \\"post and lintel\\" form, i.e. it is composed of upright beams (posts) supporting horizontal beams (lintels). Although the existent buildings of the era are constructed in stone, it is clear that the origin of the style lies in simple wooden structures, with vertical posts supporting beams which carried a ridged roof. The posts and beams divided the walls into regular compartments which could be left as openings, or filled with sun dried bricks, lathes or straw and covered with clay daub or plaster. Alternately, the spaces might be filled with rubble. It is likely that many early houses and temples were constructed with an open porch or \\"pronaos\\" above which rose a low pitched gable or pediment.[7]\\r\\nThe earliest temples, built to enshrine statues of deities, were probably of wooden construction, later replaced by the more durable stone temples many of which are still in evidence today. The signs of the original timber nature of the architecture were maintained in the stone buildings.[25]\\r\\nA few of these temples are very large, with several, such as the Temple of Zeus Olympus and the Olympians at Athens being well over 300 feet in length, but most were less than half this size. It appears that some of the large temples began as wooden constructions in which the columns were replaced piecemeal as stone became available. This, at least was the interpretation of the historian Pausanias looking at the Temple of Hera at Olympia in the 2nd century AD.[2]\\r\\nThe stone columns are made of a series of solid stone cylinders or \\"drums\\" that rest on each other without mortar, but were sometimes centred with a bronze pin. The columns are wider at the base than at the top, tapering with an outward curve known as \\"entasis\\". Each column has a capital of two parts, the upper, on which rests the lintels, being square and called the \\"abacus\\". The part of the capital that rises from the column itself is called the \\"echinus\\". It differs according to the order, being plain in the Doric Order, fluted in the Ionic and foliate in the Corinthian. Doric and usually Ionic capitals are cut with vertical grooves known as \\"fluting\\". This fluting or grooving of the columns is a retention of an element of the original wooden architecture.[25]\\r\\nThe columns of a temple support a structure that rises in two main stages, the entablature and the pediment.\\r\\nThe entablature is the major horizontal structural element supporting the roof and encircling the entire building. It is composed of three parts. Resting on the columns is the architrave made of a series of stone \\"lintels\\" that spanned the space between the columns, and meet each other at a joint directly above the centre of each column.\\r\\nAbove the architrave is a second horizontal stage called the \\"frieze\\". The frieze is one of the major decorative elements of the building and carries a sculptured relief. In the case of Ionic and Corinthian architecture, the relief decoration runs in a continuous band, but in the Doric Order, it is divided into sections called \\"metopes\\" which fill the spaces between vertical rectangular blocks called \\"triglyphs\\". The triglyphs are vertically grooved like the Doric columns, and retain the form of the wooden beams that would once have supported the roof.\\r\\nThe upper band of the entablature is called the \\"cornice\\", which is generally ornately decorated on its lower edge. The cornice retains the shape of the beams that would once have supported the wooden roof at each end of the building. At the front and rear of each temple, the entablature supports a triangular structure called the \\"pediment\\". The triangular space framed by the cornices is the location of the most significant sculptural decoration on the exterior of the building.\\r\\nEvery temple rested on a masonry base called the crepidoma, generally of three steps, of which the upper one which carried the columns was the stylobate. Masonry walls were employed for temples from about 600 BC onwards. Masonry of all types was used for ancient Greek buildings, including rubble, but the finest ashlar masonry was usually employed for temple walls, in regular courses and large sizes to minimise the joints.[7] The blocks were rough hewn and hauled from quarries to be cut and bedded very precisely, with mortar hardly ever being used. Blocks, particularly those of columns and parts of the building bearing loads were sometimes fixed in place or reinforced with iron clamps, dowels and rods of wood, bronze or iron fixed in lead to minimise corrosion.[4]\\r\\nDoor and window openings were spanned with a lintel, which in a stone building limited the possible width of the opening. The distance between columns was similarly affected by the nature of the lintel, columns on the exterior of buildings and carrying stone lintels being closer together than those on the interior, which carried wooden lintels.[26][27] Door and window openings narrowed towards the top.[27] Temples were constructed without windows, the light to the naos entering through the door. It has been suggested that some temples were lit from openings in the roof.[26] A door of the Ionic Order at the Erechtheion (17 feet high and 7.5 feet wide at the top) retains many of its features intact, including mouldings, and an entablature supported on console brackets. (See Architectural Decoration, below)[27][28][29]\\r\\nThe widest span of a temple roof was across the cella, or internal space. In a large building, this space contains columns to support the roof, the architectural form being known as hypostyle. It appears that, although the architecture of ancient Greece was initially of wooden construction, the early builders did not have the concept of the diagonal truss as a stabilising member. This is evidenced by the nature of temple construction in the 6th century BC, where the rows of columns supporting the roof the cella rise higher than the outer walls, unnecessary if roof trusses are employed as an integral part of the wooden roof. The indication is that initially all the rafters were supported directly by the entablature, walls and hypostyle, rather than on a trussed wooden frame, which came into use in Greek architecture only in the 3rd century BC.[7]\\r\\nAncient Greek buildings of timber, clay and plaster construction were probably roofed with thatch. With the rise of stone architecture came the appearance of fired ceramic roof tiles. These early roof tiles showed an S-shape, with the pan and cover tile forming one piece. They were much larger than modern roof tiles, being up to 90?cm (35.43?in) long, 70?cm (27.56?in) wide, 3ÿ4?cm (1.18ÿ1.57?in) thick and weighing around 30?kg (66?lb) apiece.[30][31] Only stone walls, which were replacing the earlier mudbrick and wood walls, were strong enough to support the weight of a tiled roof.[32]\\r\\nThe earliest finds of roof tiles of the Archaic period in Greece are documented from a very restricted area around Corinth, where fired tiles began to replace thatched roofs at the temples of Apollo and Poseidon between 700 and 650 BC.[33] Spreading rapidly, roof tiles were within fifty years in evidence for a large number of sites around the Eastern Mediterranean, including Mainland Greece, Western Asia Minor, Southern and Central Italy.[33] Being more expensive and labour-intensive to produce than thatch, their introduction has been explained by the fact that their fireproof quality would have given desired protection to the costly temples.[33] As a side-effect, it has been assumed that the new stone and tile construction also ushered in the end of overhanging eaves in Greek architecture, as they made the need for an extended roof as rain protection for the mudbrick walls obsolete.[32]\\r\\nVaults and arches were not generally used, but begin to appear in tombs (in a \\"beehive\\" or cantilevered form such as used in Mycenaea) and occasionally, as an external feature, exedrae of voussoired construction from the 5th century BC. The dome and vault never became significant structural features, as they were to become in ancient Roman architecture.[7]\\r\\nMost ancient Greek temples were rectangular, and were approximately twice as long as they were wide, with some notable exceptions such as the enormous Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens with a length of nearly 2? times its width. A number of surviving temple-like structures are circular, and are referred to as tholos.[34] The smallest temples are less than 25 metres (approx. 75 feet) in length, or in the case of the circular tholos, in diameter. The great majority of temples are between 30ÿ60 metres (approx. 100ÿ200 feet) in length. A small group of Doric temples, including the Parthenon, are between 60ÿ80 metres (approx. 200ÿ260 feet) in length. The largest temples, mainly Ionic and Corinthian, but including the Doric Temple of the Olympian Zeus, Agrigento, were between 90ÿ120 metres (approx. 300ÿ390 feet) in length.\\r\\nThe temple rises from a stepped base or \\"stylobate\\", which elevates the structure above the ground on which it stands. Early examples, such as the Temple of Zeus at Olympus, have two steps, but the majority, like the Parthenon, have three, with the exceptional example of the Temple of Apollo at Didyma having six.[35] The core of the building is a masonry-built \\"naos\\" within which is a cella, a windowless room originally housing the statue of the god. The cella generally has a porch or \\"pronaos\\" before it, and perhaps a second chamber or \\"antenaos\\" serving as a treasury or repository for trophies and gifts. The chambers were lit by a single large doorway, fitted with a wrought iron grill. Some rooms appear to have been illuminated by skylights.[35]\\r\\nOn the stylobate, often completely surrounding the naos, stand rows of columns. Each temple is defined as being of a particular type, with two terms: one describing the number of columns across the entrance front, and the other defining their distribution.[35]\\r\\nExamples:\\r\\nThe ideal of proportion that was used by ancient Greek architects in designing temples was not a simple mathematical progression using a square module. The math involved a more complex geometrical progression, the so-called Golden mean. The ratio is similar to that of the growth patterns of many spiral forms that occur in nature such as rams' horns, nautilus shells, fern fronds, and vine tendrils and which were a source of decorative motifs employed by ancient Greek architects as particularly in evidence in the volutes of capitals of the Ionic and Corinthian Orders.[36]\\r\\nThe ancient Greek architects took a philosophic approach to the rules and proportions. The determining factor in the mathematics of any notable work of architecture was its ultimate appearance. The architects calculated for perspective, for the optical illusions that make edges of objects appear concave and for the fact that columns that are viewed against the sky look different from those adjacent that are viewed against a shadowed wall. Because of these factors, the architects adjusted the plans so that the major lines of any significant building are rarely straight.[36] The most obvious adjustment is to the profile of columns, which narrow from base to top. However, the narrowing is not regular, but gently curved so that each columns appears to have a slight swelling, called entasis below the middle. The entasis is never sufficiently pronounced as to make the swelling wider than the base; it is controlled by a slight reduction in the rate of decrease of diameter.[7]\\r\\nThe Parthenon, the Temple to the Goddess Athena on the Acropolis in Athens, is referred to by many as the pinnacle of ancient Greek architecture. Helen Gardner refers to its \\"unsurpassable excellence\\", to be surveyed, studied and emulated by architects of later ages. Yet, as Gardner points out, there is hardly a straight line in the building.[37] Banister Fletcher calculated that the stylobate curves upward so that its centres at either end rise about 2.6?inches above the outer corners, and 4.3?inches on the longer sides. A slightly greater adjustment has been made to the entablature. The columns at the ends of the building are not vertical but are inclined towards the centre, with those at the corners being out of plumb by about 2.6?inches.[7] These outer columns are both slightly wider than their neighbours and are slightly closer than any of the others.[38]\\r\\nAncient Greek architecture of the most formal type, for temples and other public buildings, is divided stylistically into three \\"orders\\", first described by the Roman architectural writer Vitruvius. These are: the Doric Order, the Ionic Order and the Corinthian Order, the names reflecting their regional origins within the Greek world. While the three orders are most easily recognizable by their capitals, the orders also governed the form, proportions, details and relationships of the columns, entablature, pediment and the stylobate.[2] The different orders were applied to the whole range of buildings and monuments.\\r\\nThe Doric Order developed on mainland Greece and spread to Magna Graecia (Italy). It was firmly established and well-defined in its characteristics by the time of the building of the Temple of Hera at Olympia, c.?600 BC. The Ionic order co-existed with the Doric, being favoured by the Greek cities of Ionia, in Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands. It did not reach a clearly defined form until the mid 5th?century BC.[25] The early Ionic temples of Asia Minor were particularly ambitious in scale, such as the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus.[11] The Corinthian Order was a highly decorative variant not developed until the Hellenistic period and retaining many characteristics of the Ionic. It was popularised by the Romans.[7]\\r\\nThe Doric order is recognised by its capital, of which the echinus is like a circular cushion rising from the top of the column to the square abacus on which rest the lintels. The echinus appears flat and splayed in early examples, deeper and with greater curve in later, more refined examples, and smaller and straight-sided in Hellenistc examples.[39] A refinement of the Doric column is the entasis, a gentle convex swelling to the profile of the column, which prevents an optical illusion of concavity.[39] This is more pronounced in earlier examples.\\r\\nDoric columns are almost always cut with grooves, known as \\"fluting\\", which run the length of the column and are usually 20 in number, although sometimes fewer. The flutes meet at sharp edges called arrises. At the top of the columns, slightly below the narrowest point, and crossing the terminating arrises, are three horizontal grooves known as the hypotrachelion. Doric columns have no bases, until a few examples in the Hellenistic period.[39]\\r\\nThe columns of an early Doric temple such as the Temple of Apollo at Syracuse, Sicily, may have a height to base diameter ratio of only 4:1 and a column height to entablature ratio of 2:1, with relatively crude details. A column height to diameter of 6:1 became more usual, while the column height to entablature ratio at the Parthenon is about 3:1. During the Hellenistic period, Doric conventions of solidity and masculinity dropped away, with the slender and unfluted columns reaching a height to diameter ratio of 7.5:1.[39]\\r\\nThe Doric entablature is in three parts, the architrave, the frieze and the cornice. The architrave is composed of the stone lintels which span the space between the columns, with a joint occurring above the centre of each abacus. On this rests the frieze, one of the major areas of sculptural decoration. The frieze is divided into triglyphs and metopes, the triglyphs, as stated elsewhere in this article, are a reminder of the timber history of the architectural style. Each triglyph has three vertical grooves, similar to the columnar fluting, and below them, seemingly connected, are guttae, small strips that appear to connect the triglyphs to the architrave below.[39] A triglyph is located above the centre of each capital, and above the centre of each lintel. However, at the corners of the building, the triglyphs do not fall over the centre the column. The ancient architects took a pragmatic approach to the apparent \\"rules\\", simply extending the width of the last two metopes at each end of the building.\\r\\nThe cornice is a narrow jutting band of complex moulding which overhangs and protects the ornamented frieze, like the edge of an overhanging wooden-framed roof. It is decorated on the underside with projecting blocks, mutules, further suggesting the wooden nature of the prototype. At either end of the building the pediment rises from the cornice, framed by moulding of similar form.[39]\\r\\nThe pediment is decorated with figures that are in relief in the earlier examples, though almost freestanding by the time of the sculpture on the Parthenon. Early architectural sculptors found difficulty in creating satisfactory sculptural compositions in the tapering triangular space.[40] By the Early Classical period, with the decoration of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, (486-460 BC) the sculptors had solved the problem by having a standing central figure framed by rearing centaurs and fighting men who are falling, kneeling and lying in attitudes that fit the size and angle of each part of the space.[37] The famous sculptor Phidias fills the space at the Parthenon (448-432 BC) with a complex array of draped and undraped figures of deities who appear in attitudes of sublime relaxation and elegance.\\r\\nThe Ionic Order is recognized by its voluted capital, in which a curved echinus of similar shape to that of the Doric Order, but decorated with stylised ornament, is surmounted by a horizontal band that scrolls under to either side, forming spirals or volutes similar to those of the nautilus shell or ram's horn. In plan, the capital is rectangular. It is designed to be viewed frontally but the capitals at the corners of buildings are modified with an additional scroll so as to appear regular on two adjoining faces. In the Hellenistic period, four-fronted Ionic capitals became common.[41]\\r\\nLike the Doric Order, the Ionic Order retains signs of having its origins in wooden architecture. The horizontal spread of a flat timber plate across the top of a column is a common device in wooden construction, giving a thin upright a wider area on which to bear the lintel, while at the same time reinforcing the load-bearing strength of the lintel itself. Likewise, the columns always have bases, a necessity in wooden architecture to spread the load and protect the base of a comparatively thin upright.[41] The columns are fluted with narrow, shallow flutes that do not meet at a sharp edge but have a flat band or fillet between them. The usual number of flutes is twenty-four but there may be as many as forty-four. The base has two convex mouldings called torus, and from the late Hellenic period stood on a square plinth similar to the abacus.[41]\\r\\nThe architrave of the Ionic Order is sometimes undecorated, but more often rises in three outwardly-stepped bands like overlapping timber planks. The frieze, which runs in a continuous band, is separated from the other members by rows of small projecting blocks. They are referred to as dentils, meaning \\"teeth\\", but their origin is clearly in narrow wooden slats which supported the roof of a timber structure.[41] The Ionic Order is altogether lighter in appearance than the Doric, with the columns, including base and capital, having a 9:1 ratio with the diameter, while the whole entablature was also much narrower and less heavy than the Doric entablature. There was some variation in the distribution of decoration. Formalised bands of motifs such as alternating forms known as \\"egg and dart\\" were a feature of the Ionic entablatures, along with the bands of dentils. The external frieze often contained a continuous band of figurative sculpture or ornament, but this was not always the case. Sometimes a decorative frieze occurred around the upper part of the naos rather than on the exterior of the building. These Ionic-style friezes around the naos are sometimes found on Doric buildings, notably the Parthenon. Some temples, like the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, had friezes of figures around the lower drum of each column, separated from the fluted section by a bold moulding.[41]\\r\\nCaryatids, draped female figures used as supporting members to carry the entablature, were a feature of the Ionic order, occurring at several buildings including the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi in 525 BC and at the Erechtheion, about 410 BC.[42]\\r\\nThe Corinthian Order does not have its origin in wooden architecture. It grew directly out of the Ionic in the mid 5th century BC, and was initially of much the same style and proportion, but distinguished by its more ornate capitals.[43] The capital was very much deeper than either the Doric or the Ionic capital, being shaped like a large krater, a bell-shaped mixing bowl, and being ornamented with a double row of acanthus leaves above which rose voluted tendrils, supporting the corners of the abacus, which, no longer perfectly square, splayed above them. According to Vitruvius, the capital was invented by a bronze founder, Callimachus of Corinth, who took his inspiration from a basket of offerings that had been placed on a grave, with a flat tile on top to protect the goods. The basket had been placed on the root of an acanthus plant which had grown up around it.[43] The ratio of the column height to diameter is generally 10:1, with the capital taking up more than 1/10 of the height. The ratio of capital height to diameter is generally about 1.16:1.[43]\\r\\nThe Corinthian Order was initially used internally, as at the Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae (c.450-425 BC). In 334 BC it appeared as an external feature on the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens, and then on a huge scale at the Temple of Zeus Olympia in Athens, (174 BC - AD 132).[43] It was popularised by the Romans, who added a number of refinements and decorative details. During the Hellenistic period, Corinthian columns were sometimes built without fluting.[43]\\r\\nEarly wooden structures, particularly temples, were ornamented and in part protected by fired and painted clay revetments in the form of rectangular panels, and ornamental discs. Many fragments of these have outlived the buildings that they decorated and demonstrate a wealth of formal border designs of geometric scrolls, overlapping patterns and foliate motifs.[44] With the introduction of stone-built temples, the revetments no longer served a protective purpose and sculptured decoration became more common.\\r\\nThe clay ornaments were limited to the roof of buildings, decorating the cornice, the corners and surmounting the pediment. At the corners of pediments they were called acroteria and along the sides of the building, antefixes. Early decorative elements were generally semi-circular, but later of roughly triangular shape with moulded ornament, often palmate.[44][45] Ionic cornices were often set with a row of lion's masks, with open mouths that ejected rainwater.[26][45] From the Late Classical period, acroteria were sometimes sculptured figures.See \\"Architectural sculpture\\"[46]\\r\\nIn the three orders of ancient Greek architecture, the sculptural decoration, be it a simple half round astragal, a frieze of stylised foliage or the ornate sculpture of the pediment, is all essential to the architecture of which it is a part. In the Doric order, there is no variation in its placement. Reliefs never decorate walls in an arbitrary way. The sculpture is always located in several predetermined areas, the metopes and the pediment.[44] In later Ionic architecture, there is greater diversity in the types and numbers of mouldings and decorations, particularly around doorways, where voluted brackets sometimes occur supporting an ornamental cornice over a door, such as that at the Erechtheion.[26][28][44] A much applied narrow moulding is called \\"bead and reel\\" and is symmetrical, stemming from turned wooden prototypes. Wider mouldings include one with tongue-like or pointed leaf shapes, which are grooved and sometimes turned upward at the tip, and \\"egg and dart\\" moulding which alternates ovoid shapes with narrow pointy ones.[26][44][47]\\r\\nArchitectural sculpture showed a development from early Archaic examples through Severe Classical, High Classical, Late Classical and Hellenistic.[1] Remnants of Archaic architectural sculpture (700 - 500 BC) exist from the early 6th century BC with the earliest surviving pedimental sculpture being fragments of a Gorgon flanked by heraldic panthers from the centre of the pediment of the Artemis Temple of Corfu.[48] A metope from a temple known as \\"Temple C\\" at Selinus, Sicily, shows, in a better preserved state, Perseus slaying the Gorgon Medusa.[40] Both images parallel the stylised depiction of the Gorgons on the black figure name vase decorated by the Nessos painter (c. 600 BC), with the face and shoulders turned frontally, and the legs in a running or kneeling position. At this date images of terrifying monsters have predominance over the emphasis on the human figure that developed with Humanist philosophy.[48]\\r\\nThe Severe Classical style (500 ÿ 450 BC) is represented by the pedimental sculptures of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, (470 ÿ 456 BC). The eastern pediment shows a moment of stillness and \\"impending drama\\" before the beginning of a chariot race, the figures of Zeus and the competitors being severe and idealised representations of the human form.[49] The western pediment has Apollo as the central figure, \\"majestic\\" and \\"remote\\", presiding over a battle of Lapiths and Centaurs, in strong contrast to that of the eastern pediment for its depiction of violent action, and described by D. E. Strong as the \\"most powerful piece of illustration\\" for a hundred years.[49]\\r\\nThe shallow reliefs and three-dimensional sculpture which adorned the frieze and pediments, respectively, of the Parthenon, are the lifelike products of the High Classical style (450 ÿ 400 BC) and were created under the direction of the sculptor Phidias.[50] The pedimental sculpture represents the Gods of Olympus, while the frieze shows the Panathenaic procession and ceremonial events that took place every four years to honour the titular Goddess of Athens.[50] The frieze and remaining figures of the eastern pediment show a profound understanding of the human body, and how it varies depending upon its position and the stresses that action and emotion place upon it. Benjamin Robert Haydon described the reclining figure of Dionysus as \\"....the most heroic style of art, combined with all the essential detail of actual life\\".[51]\\r\\nThe names of many famous sculptors are known from the Late Classical period (400 ÿ 323 BC), including Timotheos, Praxiteles, Leochares and Skopas, but their works are known mainly from Roman copies.[1] Little architectural sculpture of the period remains intact. The Temple of Asclepius at Epidauros had sculpture by Timotheos working with the architect Theodotos. Fragments of the eastern pediment survive, showing the Sack of Troy. The scene appears to have filled the space with figures carefully arranged to fit the slope and shape available, as with earlier east pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympus. But the figures are more violent in action, the central space taken up, not with a commanding God, but with the dynamic figure of Neoptolemos as he seizes the aged king Priam and stabs him. The remaining fragments give the impression of a whole range of human emotions, fear, horror, cruelty and lust for conquest.[46] The acroteria were sculptured by Timotheus, except for that at the centre of the east pediment which is the work of the architect. The palmate acroteria have been replaced here with small figures, the eastern pediment being surmounted by a winged Nike, poised against the wind.[46]\\r\\nHellenistic architectural sculpture (323 ÿ 31 BC) was to become more flamboyant, both in the rendering of expression and motion, which is often emphasised by flowing draperies, the Nike Samothrace which decorated a monument in the shape of a ship being a well-known example. The Pergamon Altar (c. 180ÿ160 BC) has a frieze (120 metres long by 2.3 metres high) of figures in very high relief. The frieze represents the battle for supremacy of Gods and Titans, and employs many dramatic devices: frenzy, pathos and triumph, to convey the sense of conflict.[52]","input":"What types of architecture could you find in ancient greece?"},{"output":"between seventeen and twenty years of age","context":"Facial hair is hair grown on the face, usually on the chin, cheeks, and upper lip region. It is typically a secondary sex characteristic of human males. Men typically start developing facial hair in the later years of puberty or adolescence, between seventeen and twenty years of age, and most do not finish developing a full adult beard until their early twenties or later.[1] This varies, as boys may first develop facial hair between fourteen and sixteen years of age, and boys as young as eleven have been known to develop facial hair. Women are also capable of developing facial hair, especially after menopause, though typically significantly less than men. Men may style their facial hair into beards, moustaches, goatees or sideburns; others completely shave their facial hair. The term whiskers, when used to refer to human facial hair, indicates the hair on the chin and cheeks.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moustache forms its own stage in the development of facial hair in adolescent males.[4] Facial hair in males does not always appear in a specific order during puberty and varies among some individuals but may follow this process:\\r\\nDepending on the periods and countries, facial hair was prohibited in the army or, on the contrary, an integral part of the uniform.\\r\\nMany religious male figures are recorded to have had facial hair; for example, all the prophets mentioned in the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) were known to grow their beards. Other religions, such as Sikhism, encourage growing beards. Amish men grow beards after marriage, but continue to shave their moustaches in order to avoid historical associations with military facial hair due to their pacifistic beliefs. There are various hadiths that describe the necessary beard as its entirety, such as Sunan Abu Dawood 33;4183, which says, \\"The Prophet saw a boy with part of his head shaved and part left unshaven. He forbade them to do that, saying: Shave it all or leave it all.\\" Therefore, most non-taqlid Muslims such as the ghair muqallids, Salafis and Ahle Hadith view its growing as wajib and fardh. The reasoning for the command was reportedly to differ the Muslims from non-Muslims deriving from Sahih Bukhari, \\"Do otherwise than those who ascribe partners to Allah (the mushriks).\\"[6][7]\\r\\nWomen typically have little hair on the face, apart from eyebrows and the vellus hair that covers most of the body. However, in some cases, women have noticeable facial hair growth, most commonly after menopause. Excessive hairiness (especially facially) is known as hirsutism and is usually an indication of atypical hormonal variation. In contemporary Western culture, many women depilate facial hair that appears, as considerable social stigma is associated with facial hair on women, and freak shows and circuses have historically displayed bearded women.

The moist solid emits small amounts of hydrogen cyanide due to hydrolysis, which smells like bitter almonds.[5] Not everyone, however, can smell this; the ability to do so is a genetic trait.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe taste of potassium cyanide has been described as acrid with a burning sensation.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nKCN is produced by treating hydrogen cyanide with aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide, followed by evaporation of the solution in a vacuum:[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nor by treating formamide with potassium hydroxide[citation needed]:\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 50,000 tons of potassium cyanide are produced yearly.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 1900, before the invention of the Castner process, potassium cyanide was the most important source of alkali metal cyanides.[4] In this historical process, potassium cyanide was produced by decomposing potassium ferrocyanide:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nK4[Fe(CN)6] L 4 KCN + FeC2 + N2\\r\\n\\r\\nIn aqueous solution, KCN is dissociated into hydrated potassium (K+) ions and cyanide (CN?) ions. The common form of solid KCN, stable at ambient pressure and temperature, has the same cubic crystal structure as sodium chloride, with each potassium ion surrounded by six cyanide ions, and vice versa.  Despite the cyanide ions being diatomic, and thus less symmetric than chloride, they rotate so rapidly, their time-averaged shape is spherical.  At low temperature and high pressure, this free rotation is hindered, resulting in a less symmetric crystal structure with the cyanide ions arranged in sheets. \\r\\n[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nKCN and sodium cyanide (NaCN) are widely used in organic synthesis for the preparation of nitriles and carboxylic acids, particularly in the von Richter reaction. It also finds use for the synthesis of hydantoins, which can be useful synthetic intermediates, when reacted with a carbonyl compound such as an aldehyde or ketone in the presence of ammonium carbonate.\\r\\n\\r\\nKCN is used as a photographic fixer in the wet plate collodion process.[12] The KCN dissolves silver where it has not been made insoluble by the developer. This reveals and stabilizes the image, making it no longer sensitive to light. Modern wet plate photographers may prefer less toxic fixers, often opting for the less toxic Sodium thiosulphate, but KCN is still used.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn gold mining, KCN forms the water-soluble salt potassium gold cyanide (or gold potassium cyanide) and potassium hydroxide from gold metal in the presence of oxygen (usually from the surrounding air) and water:\\r\\n\\r\\nA similar process uses NaCN to produce sodium gold cyanide (NaAu(CN2)).\\r\\n\\r\\nPotassium cyanide is a potent inhibitor of cellular respiration, acting on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, hence blocking oxidative phosphorylation. This prevents the body from oxidizing food to produce useful energy. Lactic acidosis then occurs as a consequence of anaerobic metabolism. Initially, acute cyanide poisoning causes a red or ruddy complexion in the victim because the tissues are not able to use the oxygen in the blood. The effects of potassium and sodium cyanide are identical, and symptoms of poisoning typically occur within a few minutes of ingesting the substance: the person loses consciousness, and brain death eventually follows. During this period the victim may suffer convulsions. Death is caused by cerebral hypoxia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lethal dose(human) for potassium cyanide is 20?mg.[13]  Its toxicity when ingested depends on the acidity of the stomach, because it must react with an acid to become hydrogen cyanide, the deadly form of cyanide.

In terms of votes, they were only narrowly ahead of the Conservatives, but still had a comfortable lead in terms of seats. The Conservatives returned 198 MPs, with 32 more seats than they had won at the previous general election, and won the popular vote in England, while still ending up with 91 fewer MPs in England than Labour; this indicated the party lost many close races and won more large majorities in its heartlands. The Liberal Democrats saw their popular vote increase by 3.7% and won the most seats for any third party since 1923, with 62 MPs. Anti-war activist and former Labour MP George Galloway was elected as the MP for Bethnal Green and Bow under the Respect ÿ The Unity Coalition banner; Richard Taylor was re-elected for Kidderminster Health Concern in Worcestershire; and independent candidate Peter Law was elected in Blaenau Gwent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Northern Ireland, the Ulster Unionist Party, the more moderate of the main unionist parties, which had dominated Northern Irish politics since the 1920s, was reduced from six MPs to one, with party leader David Trimble himself being unseated. The more hardline Democratic Unionist Party became the largest Northern Irish party, with nine MPs elected. Following the election, Conservative leader Michael Howard resigned and was succeeded by future Prime Minister David Cameron. In June 2007, Blair resigned as both Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party and was replaced by then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. The election results were broadcast live on the BBC, and presented by Peter Snow, David Dimbleby, Jeremy Paxman and Andrew Marr.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe governing Labour Party, led by Tony Blair, was looking to secure a third consecutive term in office and to retain a large majority. The Conservative Party was seeking to regain seats lost to both Labour and the Liberal Democrats since the 1992 general election, and move from being the Official Opposition into government. The Liberal Democrats hoped to make gains from both main parties, but especially the Conservative Party, with a \\"decapitation\\" strategy targeting members of the Shadow Cabinet. The Lib Dems had also wished to become the governing party, or to make enough gains to become the Official Opposition; but more realistically hoped to play a major part in a parliament led by a minority Labour or Conservative government. In Northern Ireland the Democratic Unionist Party sought to make further gains from the Ulster Unionist Party in unionist politics, and Sinn Fin hoped to overtake the Social Democratic and Labour Party in nationalist politics. (Note that Sinn Fin MPs do not take their seats in the House of Commonsthey refuse to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen as required). The pro-independence Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) stood candidates in every constituency in Scotland and Wales respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany seats were contested by other parties, including several parties without incumbents in the House of Commons. Parties that were not represented at Westminster, but had seats in the devolved assemblies and/or the European Parliament, included the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the UK Independence Party, the Green Party of England and Wales, the Scottish Green Party, and the Scottish Socialist Party. The Health Concern party also stood again. A full list of parties which declared their intention to run can be found on the list of parties contesting the 2005 general election.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll parties campaigned using such tools as party manifestos, party political broadcasts and touring the country in what are commonly referred to as battle buses.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal elections in parts of England and in Northern Ireland were held on the same day. The polls were open for fifteen hours, from 07:00 to 22:00 BST (UTC+1). The election came just over three weeks after the dissolution of Parliament on 11 April by Queen Elizabeth II, at the request of the Prime Minister, Tony Blair.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the death of Pope John Paul II on 2 April, it was announced that the calling of the election would be delayed until 5 April.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to eight years of sustained economic growth Labour could point to a strong economy, with greater investment in public services such as education and health. This was overshadowed, however, by the issue of the controversial 2003 invasion of Iraq, which met widespread public criticism at the time, and would dog Blair throughout the campaign. The Chancellor, Gordon Brown, played a prominent role in the election campaign, frequently appearing with Tony Blair and ensuring that the economy would remain the central focus of Labour's message.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Conservatives, their recently elected leader Michael Howard brought a great level of experience and stability to a party that had ousted its former leader Iain Duncan Smith[3] just 18 months prior. The Conservatives focused their campaign on more traditional conservative issues like immigration, which created some controversy with the slogan \\"It's not racist to impose limits on immigration\\".[4] They also criticised Labour's \\"dirty\\" hospitals and high crime levels, under the umbrella of the slogan \\"Are you thinking what we're thinking?\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Labour counter-attacked, by emphasising Howard's role in the unpopular Major Government of 1992ÿ1997, airing a party election broadcast attacking Howard, showing a montage of scenes from Howard's tenure as Home Secretary, including prison riots and home repossessions. It also launched a billboard campaign showing Howard, and the Conservative Party's four previous leaders: Iain Duncan Smith, William Hague, John Major and Margaret Thatcher, with the caption \\"Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Liberal Democrats, this was the second, and final election campaign fought by leader Charles Kennedy, who was strongly opposed to the Iraq War, and offered a more down to earth approach to voters, which proved popular. There were some questions, however, over Kennedy's abilities when, at the Liberal Democrat manifesto launch, he was asked about local income tax, but appeared confused on the figures.[6] Both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives were keen to tackle Labour's introduction of tuition fees, which was opposed by both parties, and they promised to abolish these fees.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of voting (2200 BST) the ballot boxes were sealed and returned to the counting centres, where counting proceeded under the supervision of the returning officer who was obliged to declare the result as soon as it was known. As previously, there was serious competition amongst constituencies to be first to declare. Sunderland South repeated its performance in the last three elections and declared Labour incumbent Chris Mullin re-elected as MP with a majority of 11,059 at approximately 2245 BST (failing by two minutes to beat its previous best, but making it eligible for entry into the Guinness Book of World Records as longest consecutive delivery of first results). The vote itself represented a swing (in a safe Labour seat, in a safe Labour region) of about 4% to the Conservatives and 4.5% to the Liberal Democrats, somewhat below the prediction of BBC/ITV exit polls published shortly after 2200 BST.\\r\\n\\r\\nSunderland North was the next to declare, followed by Houghton and Washington East, both Labour holds but with reductions in the incumbent majorities of up to 9%. The first Scottish seat to declare was Rutherglen and Hamilton West? another safe Labour seat, also a Labour hold, but with the majority reduced by 4%. The first seat to change hands was Putney, where Labour's majority of around 2,500 fell to a strong Conservative challenge, with a total swing of about 5,000 (6.2%). This was also the first seat to be declared for the Conservatives. The first Liberal Democrat seat to be declared was North East Fife, the constituency of LibDem deputy leader Sir Menzies Campbell which he had held since 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constituency of Crawley in West Sussex had the slimmest majority of any seat, with Labour holding off the Conservatives by 37 votes after three recounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing problems with exit polls in previous British elections, the BBC and ITV agreed for the first time to pool their respective data, using results from Mori and NOP. More than 20,000 people were interviewed for the poll at 120 polling stations across the country. The predictions were very accurateinitial projections saw Labour returned to power with a majority of 66 (down from 160),[8] and the final result (including Staffordshire South, where the election was postponed due to the death of a candidate) was indeed a Labour majority of 66.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe projected shares of the vote in Great Britain were Labour 35% (down 6% on 2001), Conservatives 33% (up 1%), Liberal Democrats 22% (up 4%) and other parties 8% (up 1%).[8] The Conservatives were expected to make the biggest gains, however? 44 seats according to the exit poll? with the Liberal Democrats expected to take as few as two. Whilst the Lib Dems' vote share predicted by the exit poll was accurate (22.6% compared to the actual 22.0%) they did better in some Lib Dem-Labour marginals than predicted on the basis of the national share of the vote, and achieved a net gain of 11 seats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were major boundary changes in Scotland, where the number of seats were reduced from 72 to 59. As a result of this a number of seats were lost by each party, and this notional election result below is based on the 2001 election results if they had been fought on these new 2005 boundaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 04:28 BST, it was announced that Labour had won Corby, giving them 324 seats in the House of Commons out of those then declared and an overall majority, Labour's total reaching 355 seats out of the 646 House of Commons seats. Labour received 35.3% of the popular vote, equating to approximately 22% of the electorate on a 61.3% turnout, up from 59.4% turnout in 2001. Increased turnout was mostly attributed to the extension and promotion of the postal voting system, which has been criticised as being too insecure increasing the risk of electoral fraud.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs expected, voter disenchantment led to an increase of support for many opposition parties, and caused many eligible to vote, not to turn out. Labour achieved a third successive term in office for the first time in their history, though with reduction of the Labour majority from 167 to 67 (as it was before the declaration of South Staffordshire). As it became clear that Labour had won an overall majority, Michael Howard, the leader of the Conservative party, announced his intention to retire from front-line politics. The final seat to declare was the delayed poll in South Staffordshire, at just after 1?a.m. on Friday 24 June.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe election was followed by further criticism of the UK electoral system. Calls for reform came particularly from Lib Dem supporters, citing that they received only just over 10% of the overall seats with 22.1% of the popular vote. The only parties to win a higher percentage of seats than they achieved in votes were Labour, the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fin, and Health Concern, which ran only one candidate. The results of the election give a Gallagher index of dis-proportionality of 16.76.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Labour Government claimed that being returned to office for a third term for the first time ever showed the public approval of Labour's governance and the continued unpopularity of the Conservatives. Nevertheless, Labour's vote declined to 35.3%, the lowest share of the popular vote to have formed a majority government in the history of the UK House of Commons. In many areas the collapse in the Labour vote resulted in a host of seats changing hands. Labour also failed to gain any new seats, almost unique in any election since 1945. As well as losing seats to the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, Labour also lost their safest seat in Wales[9] to Independent Peter Law, and Bethnal Green and Bow to Respect candidate George Galloway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conservatives claimed that their increased number of seats showed disenchantment with the Labour government and was a precursor of a Conservative breakthrough at the next election. Following three consecutive elections of declining representation and then in 2001 a net gain of just one seat, 2005 was the first general election since 1983 where the number of Conservative seats increased appreciably, although the Conservatives' vote share increased only slightly and this election did mark the third successive general election in which the Conservatives polled below 35%. In some areas the Conservative vote actually fell. The Conservatives claimed to have won the General Election in England, since they received more votes than Labour although Labour still won a majority of seats.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Liberal Democrats claimed that their continued gradual increase in seats and percentage vote showed they were in a position to make further gains from both parties. They pointed in particular to the fact that they were now in second place in roughly one hundred and ninety constituencies and that having had net losses to Labour in the 1992 general election and having not taken a single seat off Labour in 1997, they had held their gains off Labour from the 2001 general election and had actually made further gains from them. The Liberals also managed to take 3 seats from the Conservatives, notably Tim Collins, through the use of a decapitation strategy, which targeted senior Tories.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Liberal Democrats increased their percentage of the vote by 3.7%, the Conservatives by 0.6%, and Labour's dropped by 5.4%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe results were interpreted by the UK media as an indicator of a breakdown in trust in the government, and in Prime Minister Tony Blair in particular.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the SNP had a good night in Scotland, regaining the Western Isles and Dundee East from Labour, having lost both seats in 1987.[12] In Wales Plaid Cymru failed to gain any seats, and lost Ceredigion to the Liberal Democrats. In Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionists were all but wiped out, only holding onto North Down, with leader David Trimble losing his seat in Upper Bann. For the first time the DUP became the biggest party in Northern Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the first general election since 1929 in which no party received more than ten million votes. It was the most \\"three-cornered\\" election since 1923, though the Liberal Democrats failed to match the higher national votes of the SDP-Liberal Alliance in the 1980s either in absolute or percentage terms. The total combined vote for Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats proved to be the lowest main three party vote since 1922.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure of 355 seats for Labour does not include the speaker Michael Martin. \\r\\nSee also the list of parties standing in Northern Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\n[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the election result, Labour remained in power and Tony Blair remained Prime Minister, reshuffling Cabinet and junior ministers over the following weekend, with formal announcements made on 9 May 2005. The most senior positions of Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary remained the same, but a few new faces were added; most notably David Blunkett returned to cabinet as the Work and Pensions Secretary, although he was forced to resign again due to another scandal before the end of the year that spawned a national press and opposition campaign for his dismissal. Patricia Hewitt became the new Health Secretary, Tessa Jowell remained as Culture Secretary, whilst Alan Johnson was promoted to Trade and Industry Secretary. Meanwhile, Ruth Kelly retained the Education job and Margaret Beckett stayed put at Environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new Parliament met on 11 May for the election of the Speaker of the House of Commons.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 May, Michael Howard announced he would be standing down as leader of the Conservative Party, but not before a review of the leadership rules. The formal leadership election began in October, and was ultimately won by David Cameron. On 7 May, David Trimble resigned as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party; Sir Reg Empey was elected as his successor at an Ulster Unionist Council meeting on 24 June.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe then-prime minister Gordon Brown visited Buckingham Palace on 6 April 2010 and asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April.  The next election was held on 6 May 2010.[15]","input":"Which political party was in power in 2005?"},{"output":"St. Lucie County","context":"Port St. Lucie is a city in St. Lucie County, Florida, United States. It is the most populous municipality in the county with a population of 164,603 at the 2010 census due to its rapid growth during the 2000s. In 2013, the state of Florida estimated the city's population at 171,016.[6] Port St. Lucie forms part of a metropolitan area called the Port St. Lucie, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area that in 2013 was estimated to have 438,095 residents. As of 2015, the city had 179,413 residents, surpassing Fort Lauderdale in population.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPort St. Lucie was a largely uninhabited tract of land south of White City in the 1950s, composed of a fishing camp, a few farms and businesses near U.S. 1. In 1958, with a budget of $5, the General Development Corporation (GDC) purchased the River Park development and 40,000 acres (160?km2) along the North Fork of the St. Lucie River.[7] In 1959, the GDC opened its first bridge over the St. Lucie River, allowing for direct automobile access to Port St. Lucie.\\r\\nBy February 25, 1961 there were 250 homes in the new city. GDC requested the state legislature to incorporate 70 miles (110?km), along with the River Park settlement, into the City of Port St. Lucie. River Park did not incorporate into the city at the request of its residents. Port St. Lucie became a city on April 27, 1961 with the passage of House Bill No. 953, proposed by State Representative Rupert Smith and approved by Florida Governor C. Farris Bryant.[8]\\r\\nIn the early 1990s, Core Communities (CC), acquired and began planning what would become St. Lucie West.[citation needed] Originally, St. Lucie West was to have contained about 14,000 homes over a 20-year period on 7 square miles (18?km2).[citation needed] But after realizing the community's strategic position, they began developing it into more than just a residential area. CC began building business sectors and places of entertainment and leisure. That resulted in 7,000 jobs being brought to the small town, helping it into its boom during most of the early 2000s.[9]\\r\\nIn 2006, CC started development of its newest community, Tradition.[citation needed] The community, which sits west of the Interstate 95 intersection of Gatlin Blvd., was a large cattle ranch before CC began to develop it. There they built around 13,000,000 square feet (1,200,000?m2) of commercial area, and room for over 18,000 residences. According to CC's website, Tradition is the largest fully entitled residential development area from the tip of Interstate 95 to the CanadaÿU.S. border.[citation needed] It is modeled after a 1950s-era town. According to its website, Tradition Square, the town center of the community, holds festivities year-round. It was also chosen as the site of HGTV's Green Home 2009, and one of America's best 100 communities.[9]\\r\\nIn 2007, the housing market began to collapse and unemployment started to rise. As of February 2009, unemployment was at 10? percent and in 2008, nearly 11,000 homes went into foreclosure. This prompted the county government to consider declaring itself a disaster area. Doing so would have given county administrators access to $17 million in county emergency reserve funds. That money, combined with a transportation fund and other accounts, would give St. Lucie $20 ÿ $30 million to spend on building projects: research parks, highways and other infrastructure improvements.[10]\\r\\nIn 2008, Tradition and Core Communities welcomed the Florida Center of Innovation, a research laboratory and campus, which has a building in Tradition for two biotech and life science companies, the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies and the Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute. This campus alone is projected to bring more than 30,000 jobs to the city of Port St. Lucie.[9]\\r\\nAs of 2000, 31.6% of households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.8% were married couples living together, 10.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.1% were non-families. 18.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.9% had someone living alone who was aged 65 or older.

The TPO is governed by a TPO Board, which is composed of elected officials, representatives from the St. Lucie County School Board, and representatives from Community Transit, a division of The Council on Aging of St. Lucie, Inc.[17] The original bus system started out as a demand response service bus in the 1990s, it only served St. Lucie County. Soon it expanded to a fixed route system, going to predetermined locations along a route. On June 3, 2002, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT)[18] approved funding, expanding the bus service to Martin County, and became the Treasure Coast Connector.[19]\\r\\n Florida's Turnpike (State Road 91) is the only toll road in St. Lucie County, which is the northernmost place where the Turnpike and Interstate 95 run close to each other. The Turnpike has 2 exits within Port St. Lucie's city limits: Port St. Lucie Boulevard (SR 716) and Becker Road. For most of its route through St. Lucie County, the Turnpike is east of I-95. The Turnpike provides access to Orlando to the north, and Miami to the southeast.\\r\\n Interstate 95 (State Road 9) is in the western portion of the city. It is 6 lanes wide (3 in each direction), and provides access to Miami and Jacksonville.

Stars are a familiar and popular symbol, with scales of one to three or five stars commonly used. Ratings appear in guide books as well as in the media, typically in newspapers, lifestyle magazines and webzines. Websites featuring consumer-written reviews and ratings are increasingly popular, but are far less reliable.[1]\\r\\nIn addition, there are ratings given by public health agencies rating the level of sanitation practiced by an establishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most Well known guides is the Michelin series which award one to three stars to restaurants they perceive to be of high culinary merit. One star indicates a \\"very good restaurant\\"; two stars indicate a place \\"worth a detour\\"; three stars means \\"exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey\\".\\r\\nSeveral bigger newspapers employ restaurant critics and publish online dining guides for the cities they serve, such as the Irish Independent for Irish restaurants.\\r\\nInternet restaurant review sites have empowered regular people to generate non-expert reviews. This has sparked criticism from restaurant establishments about the non-editorial, non-professional critiques. Those reviews can be falsified or faked.[1][3]\\r\\nThe different guides have their own criteria. Not every guide looks behind the scenes or decorum. Others look particularly sharply to value for money. This is why a restaurant can be missing in one guide, while mentioned in another. Because the guides work independently, it is possible to have simultaneous multiple recognitions.[4][5][6][7][8]\\r\\nA top restaurant rating can mean success or failure for a restaurant, particularly when bestowed by an influential sources such as Michelin. Still, a good rating is not enough for economic success and many Michelin starred and/or highly rated restaurants have met the same fate as the Dutch restaurant De Swaen.\\r\\nIn 2004, Michelin came under fire after bipolar chef Bernard Loiseau committed suicide after he was rumoured to be in danger of losing one of his three Michelin stars. However, the Michelin guide had stated he would not be downgraded. Most news reports attributed his suicide to the downgrade carried out by the rival Gault Millau guide.\\r\\nMany countries have a system of checks and inspections in place for sanitation. Only a few countries, amongst others the United States and Canada, create and publish restaurant ratings based on this. However, the whole of the United Kingdom is covered - as is Denmark.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the United States, several states have imposed uniform statewide restaurant grading systems, under which safety and hygiene inspection reports are used to compute numerical scores or letter grades, and those must be prominently posted by restaurants.[9] The first state to enact such a statewide system was South Carolina in 1995.[9] Tennessee and North Carolina later enacted legislation imposing similar statewide systems.[9]\\r\\nIn many other states, the mandatory posting of restaurant grades is neither required nor prohibited statewide, which means it is purely a matter for local governments like cities and counties.[9]\\r\\nIn November 1997, a KCBS-TV sweeps news story called Behind The Kitchen Door focused attention on problems in Los Angeles's top restaurants. The station used hidden cameras to catch restaurant employees practicing unsafe food handling practices such as picking up food from the floor and re-serving it, vermin crawling near food to be served, and mixing uncooked meat and vegetables.[citation needed] The KCBS report also reviewed inspection reports, which have always been public records, but were available only on request (and at the time required an in-person visit to the health department), and found that many problems had already been expressly identified in the inspection reports but had not been adequately publicized.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a result of this report, in December 1997 the Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County introduced a letter grading system already in use for some years in two other nearby counties, San Diego County and Riverside County. Instead of merely listing violations in a report, the restaurant inspection system was changed to a point system, with each restaurant starting each inspection with a perfect score of 100 points.[9] Environmental health specialists were required to use a standard form called the Food Official Inspection Report to identify violations as they inspected establishments; the form required them to subtract a certain number of points for each violation found.[9] Based on the number of points remaining, letter grades were then assigned and required to be prominently posted at all establishments selling food, and all establishments were also required to provide a copy of the underlying inspection report to any customer on request.[9] Grades are available at the County Public Health Department's web site.[10]\\r\\nTwo Stanford University economics researchers found that higher lettered restaurants scored a rise in revenue, while lower lettered restaurants have seen their revenues decline. The quality of restaurants in the entire county became more acceptable, with the average score going up from about 75% to nearly 90% in the year after restaurant grading was implemented. The researchers concluded that the results were not explained solely by consumers switching to higher quality restaurants, and that some of the effect had to do with restaurants making changes due to grade cards.[11][12] Another study estimated a 13.1% reduction in hospitalization for food borne illnesses in the year following implementation of the program, suggesting that implementing a restaurant grading program could improve public safety.[13]\\r\\nAlthough Los Angeles County was not the first local jurisdiction to require restaurants to post grades, its success in implementing such a program inspired many other local governments during the 2000s to enact similar programs based on the Los Angeles model, such as Toronto, Las Vegas, Dallas, and New York City.[9]","input":"How many michelin stars can a restaurant get?"},{"output":"Native American origin","context":"Tallulah (or minor variations thereof) as a given name is of Native American origin, meaning \\"leaping water\\".

It was originally composed by Captain George Thatcher Balch, a Union Army Officer during the Civil War and later a teacher of patriotism in New York City schools.[5][6] The form of the pledge used today was largely devised by Francis Bellamy in 1892, and formally adopted by Congress as the pledge in 1942.[7] The official name of The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945. The most recent alteration of its wording came on Flag Day in 1954, when the words \\"under God\\" were added.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nCongressional sessions open with the recital of the Pledge, as do many government meetings at local levels, and meetings held by many private organizations. All states except Hawaii, Iowa, Vermont and Wyoming require a regularly scheduled recitation of the pledge in the public schools, although the Supreme Court has ruled in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette that students cannot be compelled to recite the Pledge, nor can they be punished for not doing so.[9] In a number of states, state flag pledges of allegiance are required to be recited after this.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Flag Code says:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag\\"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation  under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\"[11]should be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. When not in uniform men should remove any non-religious headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute. Members of the Armed Forces not in uniform and veterans may render the military salute in the manner provided for persons in uniform.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pledge of Allegiance, as it exists in its current form, was composed in August 1892 by Francis Bellamy (1855ÿ1931), who was a Baptist minister, a Christian socialist,[12][13] and the cousin of socialist utopian novelist Edward Bellamy (1850ÿ1898). There did exist a previous version created by Captain George T. Balch, a veteran of the Civil War, who later became auditor of the New York Board of Education. Balch's pledge, which existed contemporaneously with the Bellamy version until the 1923 National Flag Conference, read:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe give our heads and hearts to God and our country; one country, one language, one flag!\\r\\n\\r\\nBalch was a proponent of teaching children, especially those of immigrants, loyalty to the United States, even going so far as to write a book on the subject and work with both the government and private organizations to distribute flags to every classroom and school.[14] Balch's pledge, which predates Bellamy's by 5 years and was embraced by many schools, by the Daughters of the American Revolution until the 1910s, and by the Grand Army of the Republic until the 1923 National Flag Conference, is often overlooked when discussing the history of the Pledge.[15] Bellamy, however, did not approve of the pledge as Balch had written it, referring to the text as \\"too juvenile and lacking in dignity.\\"[16] The Bellamy \\"Pledge of Allegiance\\" was first published in the September 8 issue of the popular children's magazine The Youth's Companion as part of the National Public-School Celebration of Columbus Day, a celebration of the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas. The event was conceived and promoted by James B. Upham, a marketer for the magazine, as a campaign to instill the idea of American nationalism in students and to encourage children to raise flags above their schools.[17] According to author Margarette S. Miller, this campaign was in line both with Upham's patriotic vision as well as with his commercial interest. According to Miller, Upham \\"would often say to his wife: 'Mary, if I can instill into the minds of our American youth a love for their country and the principles on which it was founded, and create in them an ambition to carry on with the ideals which the early founders wrote into The Constitution, I shall not have lived in vain.'\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nBellamy's original Pledge read:\\r\\n\\r\\nI pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.[1][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pledge was supposed to be quick and to the point. Bellamy designed it to be recited in 15 seconds. As a socialist, he had initially also considered using the words equality and fraternity[17] but decided against it, knowing that the state superintendents of education on his committee were against equality for women and African Americans.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancis Bellamy and Upham had lined up the National Education Association to support the Youth's Companion as a sponsor of the Columbus Day observance and the use in that observance of the American flag. By June 29, 1892, Bellamy and Upham had arranged for Congress and President Benjamin Harrison to announce a proclamation making the public school flag ceremony the center of the Columbus Day celebrations. This arrangement was formalized when Harrison issued Presidential Proclamation 335. Subsequently, the Pledge was first used in public schools on October 12, 1892, during Columbus Day observances organized to coincide with the opening of the World's Columbian Exposition (the Chicago World's Fair), Illinois.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his recollection of the creation of the Pledge, Francis Bellamy said, \\"At the beginning of the nineties patriotism and national feeling was (sic) at a low ebb. The patriotic ardor of the Civil War was an old story?... The time was ripe for a reawakening of simple Americanism and the leaders in the new movement rightly felt that patriotic education should begin in the public schools.\\"[16] James Upham \\"felt that a flag should be on every schoolhouse,\\"[16] so his publication \\"fostered a plan of selling flags to schools through the children themselves at cost, which was so successful that 25,000 schools acquired flags in the first year (1892ÿ93).[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the World's Columbian Exposition was set to celebrate the 400th anniversary the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas, Upham sought to link the publication's flag drive to the event, \\"so that every school in the land?... would have a flag raising, under the most impressive conditions.\\"[16] Bellamy was placed in charge of this operation and was soon lobbying \\"not only the superintendents of education in all the States, but [he] also worked with governors, Congressmen, and even the President of the United States.\\"[16] The publication's efforts paid off when Benjamin Harrison declared Wednesday October 12, 1892, to be Columbus Day for which The Youth's Companion made \\"an official program for universal use in all the schools.\\"[16] Bellamy recalled that the event \\"had to be more than a list of exercises. The ritual must be prepared with simplicity and dignity.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdna Dean Proctor wrote an ode for the event, and \\"There was also an oration suitable for declamation.\\"[16] Bellamy held that \\"Of course, the nub of the program was to be the raising of the flag, with a salute to the flag recited by the pupils in unison.\\"[16] He found \\"There was not a satisfactory enough form for this salute. The Balch salute, which ran, \\"I give my heart and my hand to my country, one country, one language, one flag,\\" seemed to him too juvenile and lacking in dignity.\\"[16] After working on the idea with Upham, Bellamy concluded, \\"It was my thought that a vow of loyalty or allegiance to the flag should be the dominant idea. I especially stressed the word 'allegiance'. ...?Beginning with the new word allegiance, I first decided that 'pledge' was a better school word than 'vow' or 'swear'; and that the first person singular should be used, and that 'my' flag was preferable to 'the.'\\"[16] Bellamy considered the words \\"country, nation, or Republic,\\" choosing the last as \\"it distinguished the form of government chosen by the founding fathers and established by the Revolution. The true reason for allegiance to the flag is the Republic for which it stands.\\"[16] Bellamy then reflected on the sayings of Revolutionary and Civil War figures, and concluded \\"all that pictured struggle reduced itself to three words, one Nation indivisible.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nBellamy considered the slogan of the French Revolution, Libert, galit, fraternit (\\"liberty, equality, fraternity\\"), but held that \\"fraternity was too remote of realization, and  [that] equality was a dubious word.\\"[16] Concluding \\"Liberty and justice were surely basic, were undebatable, and were all that any one Nation could handle. If they were exercised for all. They involved the spirit of equality and fraternity.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being reviewed by Upham and other members of The Youth's Companion, the Pledge was approved and put in the official Columbus Day program. Bellamy noted that \\"in later years the words 'to my flag' were changed to 'to the flag of the United States of America' because of the large number of foreign children in the schools.\\"[16] Bellamy disliked the change, as \\"it did injure the rhythmic balance of the original composition.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1906, The Daughters of the American Revolution's magazine, The American Monthly, listed the \\"formula of allegiance\\" as being the Balch Pledge of Allegiance, which reads:[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nI pledge allegiance to my flag, and the republic for which it stands. I pledge my head and my heart to God and my country. One country, one language and one flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn subsequent publications of the Daughters of the American Revolution, such as in 1915's \\"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Continental Congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution\\" and 1916's annual \\"National Report,\\" the Balch Pledge, listed as official in 1906, is now categorized as \\"Old Pledge\\" with Bellamy's version under the heading \\"New Pledge.\\"[22][23] However, the \\"Old Pledge\\" continued to be used by other organizations until the National Flag Conference established uniform flag procedures in 1923.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1923, the National Flag Conference called for the words \\"my Flag\\" to be changed to \\"the Flag of the United States,\\" so that new immigrants would not confuse loyalties between their birth countries and the US. The words \\"of America\\" were added a year later. Congress officially recognized the Pledge for the first time, in the following form, on June 22, 1942:[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouis Albert Bowman, an attorney from Illinois, was the first to suggest the addition of \\"under God\\" to the pledge. The National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution gave him an Award of Merit as the originator of this idea.[25][26] He spent his adult life in the Chicago area and was chaplain of the Illinois Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. At a meeting on February 12, 1948,[25] he led the society in reciting the pledge with the two words \\"under God\\" added. He said that the words came from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Although not all manuscript versions of the Gettysburg Address contain the words \\"under God\\", all the reporters' transcripts of the speech as delivered do, as perhaps Lincoln may have deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he said \\"that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom.\\" Bowman repeated his revised version of the Pledge at other meetings.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1951, the Knights of Columbus, the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization, also began including the words \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance.[27] In New York City, on April 30, 1951, the board of directors of the Knights of Columbus adopted a resolution to amend the text of their Pledge of Allegiance at the opening of each of the meetings of the 800 Fourth Degree Assemblies of the Knights of Columbus by addition of the words \\"under God\\" after the words \\"one nation.\\" Over the next two years, the idea spread throughout Knights of Columbus organizations nationwide. On August 21, 1952, the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus at its annual meeting adopted a resolution urging that the change be made universal, and copies of this resolution were sent to the President, the Vice President (as Presiding Officer of the Senate), and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The National Fraternal Congress meeting in Boston on September 24, 1952, adopted a similar resolution upon the recommendation of its president, Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart. Several State Fraternal Congresses acted likewise almost immediately thereafter. This campaign led to several official attempts to prompt Congress to adopt the Knights of Columbus policy for the entire nation. These attempts were eventually a success.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the suggestion of a correspondent, Representative Louis C. Rabaut (D-Mich.), of Michigan sponsored a resolution to add the words \\"under God\\" to the Pledge in 1953.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore February 1954, no endeavor to get the pledge officially amended had succeeded. The final successful push came from George MacPherson Docherty. Some American presidents honored Lincoln's birthday by attending services at the church Lincoln attended, New York Avenue Presbyterian Church by sitting in Lincoln's pew on the Sunday nearest February 12. On February 7, 1954, with President Eisenhower sitting in Lincoln's pew, the church's pastor, George MacPherson Docherty, delivered a sermon based on the Gettysburg Address entitled \\"A New Birth of Freedom.\\" He argued that the nation's might lay not in arms but rather in its spirit and higher purpose. He noted that the Pledge's sentiments could be those of any nation: \\"There was something missing in the pledge, and that which was missing was the characteristic and definitive factor in the American way of life.\\" He cited Lincoln's words \\"under God\\" as defining words that set the US apart from other nations.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Eisenhower had been baptized a Presbyterian very recently, just a year before. He responded enthusiastically to Docherty in a conversation following the service. Eisenhower acted on his suggestion the next day and on February 8, 1954, Rep. Charles Oakman (R-Mich.), introduced a bill to that effect. Congress passed the necessary legislation and Eisenhower signed the bill into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954.[30] Eisenhower said:\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural school house, the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty.... In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource, in peace or in war.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase \\"under God\\" was incorporated into the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14, 1954, by a Joint Resolution of Congress amending ?4 of the Flag Code enacted in 1942.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 6, 1954, the National Executive Committee of the American Legion adopted a resolution, first approved by the Illinois American Legion Convention in August 1954, which formally recognized the Knights of Columbus for having initiated and brought forward the amendment to the Pledge of Allegiance.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though the movement behind inserting \\"under God\\" into the pledge might have been initiated by a private religious fraternity and even though references to God appear in previous versions of the pledge, historian Kevin M. Kruse asserts that this movement was an effort by corporate America to instill in the minds of the people that capitalism and free enterprise were heavenly blessed. Kruse acknowledges the insertion of the phrase was influenced by the push-back against Russian atheistic communism during the Cold War, but argues the longer arc of history shows the conflation of Christianity and capitalism as a challenge to the New Deal played the larger role.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwearing of the Pledge is accompanied by a salute. An early version of the salute, adopted in 1887, known as the Balch Salute, which accompanied the Balch pledge, instructed students to stand with their right hand outstretched toward the flag, the fingers of which are then brought to the forehead, followed by being placed flat over the heart, and finally falling to the side.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1892, Francis Bellamy created what was known as the Bellamy salute. It started with the hand outstretched toward the flag, palm down, and ended with the palm up. Because of the similarity between the Bellamy salute and the Nazi salute, which was adopted in Germany later, the US Congress stipulated that the hand-over-the-heart gesture as the salute to be rendered by civilians during the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem in the US would be the salute to replace the Bellamy salute. Removal of the Bellamy salute occurred on December 22, 1942, when Congress amended the Flag Code language first passed into law on June 22, 1942.[33] Attached to bills passed in Congress in 2008 and then in 2009 (Section 301(b)(1) of title 36, United States Code), language was included which authorized all active duty military personnel and all veterans in civilian clothes to render a proper hand salute during the raising and lowering of the flag, when the colors are presented, and during the National Anthem.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nA musical setting for \\"The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag\\" was created by Irving Caesar, at the suggestion of Congressman Louis C. Rabaut whose House Resolution 243 to add the phrase \\"under God\\" was signed into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composer, Irving Caesar, wrote and published over 700 songs in his lifetime. Dedicated to social issues, he donated all rights of the musical setting to the U.S. government, so that anyone can perform the piece without owing royalties.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was sung for the first time on the floor of the House of Representatives on Flag Day, June 14, 1955 by the official Air Force choral group the \\"Singing Sergeants\\". A July 29, 1955 House and Senate resolution authorized the  U.S. Government Printing Office to print and distribute the song sheet together with a history of the pledge.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther musical versions of the Pledge have since been copyrighted, including by Beck (2003), Lovrekovich (2002 and 2001), Roton (1991), Fijol (1986), and Girardet (1983).[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1940, the Supreme Court, in Minersville School District v. Gobitis, ruled that students in public schools, including the respondents in that caseJehovah's Witnesses who considered the flag salute to be idolatrycould be compelled to swear the Pledge. In 1943, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the Supreme Court reversed its decision. Justice Robert H. Jackson, writing for the 6 to 3 majority, went beyond simply ruling in the precise matter presented by the case to say that public school students are not required to say the Pledge on narrow grounds, and asserted that such ideological dogmata are antithetical to the principles of the country, concluding with:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. If there are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a later case, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals held that students are also not required to stand for the Pledge.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nRequiring or promoting of the Pledge on the part of the government has continued to draw criticism and legal challenges on several grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne objection is that a democratic republic built on freedom of dissent should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech in the context of the ritual of pledging allegiance.[42][41] Another objection is that the people who are most likely to recite the Pledge every day, small children in schools, cannot really give their consent or even completely understand the Pledge they are making.[43] Another criticism is that a government requiring or promoting the phrase \\"under God\\" violates protections against the establishment of religion guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg said the original supporters of the addition thought that they were simply quoting Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, but to Lincoln and his contemporaries, \\"under God\\" meant \\"God willing\\", so they would have found its use in the Pledge of Allegiance grammatically incorrect and semantically odd.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nProminent legal challenges were brought in the 1930s and 1940s by Jehovah's Witnesses, a denomination whose beliefs preclude swearing loyalty to any power other than God, and who objected to policies in public schools requiring students to swear an oath to the flag.[47] They said requiring the pledge violated their freedom of religion guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The first case was in 1935, when two children, Lillian and William Gobitas, ages ten and twelve, were expelled from the Minersville, Pennsylvania, public schools that year for failing to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.[48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2002 case brought by atheist Michael Newdow, whose daughter was being taught the Pledge in school, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the phrase \\"under God\\" an unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism when the Pledge was promoted in public school. In 2004, the Supreme Court heard Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, an appeal of the ruling, and rejected Newdow's claim on the grounds that he was not the custodial parent, and therefore lacked standing, thus avoiding ruling on the merits of whether the phrase was constitutional in a school-sponsored recitation. On January 3, 2005, a new suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of three unnamed families. On September 14, 2005, District Court Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled in their favor. Citing the precedent of the 2002 ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Karlton issued an order stating that, upon proper motion, he would enjoin the school district defendants from continuing their practices of leading children in pledging allegiance to \\"one Nation under God.\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, in the Florida case Frazier v. Alexandre, a federal district court in Florida ruled that a 1942 state law requiring students to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.[51] As a result of that decision, a Florida school district was ordered to pay $32,500 to a student who chose not to say the pledge and was ridiculed and called \\"unpatriotic\\" by a teacher.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, a Montgomery County, Maryland, teacher berated and had school police remove a 13-year-old girl who refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance in the classroom. The student's mother, assisted by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, sought and received an apology from the teacher, as state law and the school's student handbook both prohibit students from being forced to recite the Pledge.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 11, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the words \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance in the case of Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District.[54][55] In a 2ÿ1 decision, the appellate court ruled that the words were of a \\"ceremonial and patriotic nature\\" and did not constitute an establishment of religion.[54] Judge Stephen Reinhardt dissented, writing that \\"the state-directed, teacher-led daily recitation in public schools of the amended 'under God' version of the Pledge of Allegiance... violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\\"[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 12, 2010, in a unanimous decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston affirmed a ruling by a New Hampshire lower federal court which found that the pledge's reference to God does not violate non-pledging students' rights if student participation in the pledge is voluntary.[57][58] A United States Supreme Court appeal of this decision was denied on June 13, 2011.[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2013, a case was brought before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, arguing that the pledge violates the Equal Rights Amendment of the Constitution of Massachusetts.[61] In May 2014, Massachusetts' highest court ruled that the pledge does not discriminate against atheists, saying that the words \\"under God\\" represent a patriotic, not a religious, exercise.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2015 New Jersey Superior Court Judge David F. Bauman dismissed a lawsuit, ruling that \\" the Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the rights of those who don't believe in God and does not have to be removed from the patriotic message.\\"[63] The case against the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District had been brought by a student of the district and the American Humanist Association that argued that the phrase \\"under God\\" in the pledge created a climate of discrimination because it promoted religion, making non-believers \\"second-class citizens.\\" In a twenty-one page decision, Bauman wrote, \\"Under [the association members'] reasoning, the very constitution under which [the members] seek redress for perceived atheistic marginalization could itself be deemed unconstitutional, an absurd proposition which [association members] do not and cannot advance here.\\"[63] Bauman said the student could skip the pledge, but upheld a New Jersey law that says pupils must recite the pledge unless they have \\"conscientious scruples\\" that do not allow it.[64][65] He noted, \\"As a matter of historical tradition, the words 'under God' can no more be expunged from the national consciousness than the words 'In God We Trust' from every coin in the land, than the words 'so help me God' from every presidential oath since 1789, or than the prayer that has opened every congressional session of legislative business since 1787.","input":"When was the pledge of allegiance first used in schools?"},{"output":"white with distinctive pinstripes and a navy blue interlocking \\"NY\\" at the chest","context":"This article is about the historical and current logos and uniforms of the New York Yankees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent cap logo\\r\\nJersey logo 1903ÿ1904\\r\\nCurrent jersey logo\\r\\nCurrent print insignia\\r\\nThroughout much of their tenure as the Highlanders, the logo was variations of a stylized N and Y, which lay separately on either side of the jersey's breast. In 1905, the two locked for one season, but not in the way used today. It wasn't until 1909 that the team changed to the familiar interlocking NY that would be the team logo long after the team became known as the Yankees, and would continue to be the cap insignia until today. The interlocking NY was originally designed by Tiffany & Co. and struck on a medal of honor presented in 1877 to John McDowell, a New York City police officer shot in the line of duty.[1][2]\\r\\nThe primary logo, created in 1947 by sports artist Henry Alonzo Keller,[3] consists of \\"Yankees\\" against a baseball, written in red script with a red bat forming the vertical line of the K, an Uncle Sam hat hanging from the barrel. The logo was slightly changed over the years, with the current version first appearing in the 1970s.\\r\\nThe interlocking NY has varied greatly, and there are currently three major versions in use. The first is the cap insignia, in which the N and Y are of about the same size and unadorned. The second is the logo on the breast of the home jersey. This logo first appeared there in 1912, continued through the 1913 renaming to the New York Yankees,[4] and after disappearing in 1917, returned for good in 1936, although there have been many small but apparent changes through the years. In the jersey logo, the Y is larger, the letters more blocky, and the curves more exaggerated. The third is the print logo which is used extensively in marketing, is painted behind home plate at the Stadium, and appears on the team's batting helmets. The N is larger and more curved, and the letters have large serifs at the end.\\r\\nIn 1992, the Yankees along with all MLB teams, had an MLB logo on the back of their caps for the first time. The following year, the Yankees became one of the last teams to wear a cap with a green underbrim. They did not switch to a gray underbrim until 1994, when most teams had been wearing a gray underbrim since the late 1980s. In the 1996 World Series, the Yankees, along with the Atlanta Braves, became the first teams to wear their caps with World Series patches sewn on the side. In 1998, the Yankees had the number #39 sewn on the back of their caps, next to the MLB logo, for Darryl Strawberry, because he was suffering from colon cancer at the time. When the MLB season opened in 2001, it was the 100th Anniversary of the American League. The Yankees had an AL 100th Anniversary patch on the side of their caps for the opening day series. When the Yankees celebrated their 100th Anniversary in 2003, they had a patch on the side of their caps, commemorating it as well. The Yankees along with all MLB teams stopped wearing wool caps, beginning in the year 2007. The new caps now have a black underbrim to reduce glare, and a more 3D MLB logo on the back. In 2009, to celebrate the inaugural season at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees had an inaugural season patch on the back of their caps. It is the first time in MLB history that a patch was in the back of a cap instead of just the MLB logo. However, the Yankees players that played in the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, in St. Louis had the regular MLB logo on the back of their caps. Starting in the 2010 MLB season, the Yankees MLB logo on the back of the caps and the back collar of the jerseys had gray behind the bat of the MLB logo instead of the usual red, which was present on Yankee caps since 1992.\\r\\nThe Yankees use a block letter \\"NEW YORK\\" wordmark on the gray road uniform which has also become emblematic.

The home uniform is white with distinctive pinstripes and a navy blue interlocking \\"NY\\" at the chest. The away uniform is gray with a navy blue \\"NEW YORK\\" written across the chest. The player number is on the back of the uniform jersey, and is not accompanied by the player name. A navy blue cap with a white interlocking \\"NY\\" logo is worn with both uniforms.\\r\\nContrary to baseball legend, the Yankees did not start wearing pinstriped uniforms to make Babe Ruth look slimmer in the late 1920s and 1930s. In truth, the Yankees added pinstripes to their uniforms on a permanent basis soon after Ruppert bought the team in 1915[5] after briefly wearing pinstripes in 1912.\\r\\nIn 1929, the New York Yankees became the first team to make numbers a permanent part of the uniform. Numbers were handed out based on the order in the lineup. In 1929, Earle Combs wore #1, Mark Koenig #2, Babe Ruth #3, Lou Gehrig #4, Bob Meusel #5, Tony Lazzeri #6, Leo Durocher #7, Johnny Grabowski #8, Benny Bengough #9, and Bill Dickey #10. The team has never issued #0 or #00.[6] When other teams began putting names on the backs of jerseys in the 1960s, the Yankees did not follow suit. Many companies have created replica Yankee jerseys and other apparel with the player name above the number on the back for fans to purchase, but the only official Yankee uniform that has ever had a name on the back was a special uniform used during MLB's inaugural Players Weekend on August 25ÿ27, 2017.[7] Apart from the Players Weekend jerseys,[7] the Yankees are the only team in Major League Baseball that has never displayed the logo of the official uniform supplier, currently Majestic Athletic, on game jerseys or pants supplied to players. They are also one of only two teams (the other being the Detroit Tigers) in Major League Baseball to shun the trend of creating a third \\"alternate\\" jersey.\\r\\nThe home uniform has been the same (apart from minor changes) since 1936 ÿ longer than any current uniform design in Major League Baseball ÿ although patches commemorating milestones or special events may be worn for all or part of a season. The team will occasionally wear a black armband on the left sleeve, usually in honor of a Yankee great that died (in the case of some players, his number is frequently sewn above the armband).\\r\\nIn 1990, the Yankees wore a #1 patch on their left sleeve in tribute to Billy Martin, who died in a car crash on Christmas Day of 1989. It was the first time the Yankees paid tribute to a retired legend by putting their jersey number on their left sleeve. They did the same for Mickey Mantle in 1995, Joe DiMaggio in 1999, Phil Rizzuto in 2007 and Yogi Berra in late 2015.\\r\\nFor the 2008 season, the team wore a patch commemorating the 2008 All-Star Game, another commemorating the last season in Yankee Stadium, and a black armband to honor Bobby Murcer who died July 12, 2008 due to complication related to brain cancer.[8]\\r\\nIn 2009, to commemorate the inaugural season at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees had an inaugural season patch on the left sleeve of the jersey.\\r\\nBeginning in the 2010 season, the MLB logo, on the back collar of their jerseys, has gray behind the bat of the MLB logo, instead of the usual red, which was on the jersey since 2000, when all of the MLB teams started wearing the MLB logo on the back collar. Upon the deaths of owner George Steinbrenner and P.A. announcer Bob Sheppard, the Yankees sported two patches from July 16 until the end of the season; the left breast patch in memory of Steinbrenner, and a left shoulder patch in memory of Sheppard. The Yankees also added a black armband in memory of Ralph Houk upon his death on July 21.\\r\\nAlthough the Yankees have worn the same road uniform since 1918 (with the exception of 1927 to 1930, when the arched \\"NEW YORK\\" was replaced by the word \\"YANKEES\\"), a radical change was proposed in 1974. Marty Appel, in his book Now Pitching for the Yankees, describes the proposed uniforms:[9]\\r\\nThe Yankees did, however, make some minor updates to the road uniforms that season, including adding striping patterns to the sleeves and a white outline to the jersey numbers and the \\"NEW YORK\\" arch. This has remained since and was the only significant change to the road uniform until mid-2016 season when the road batting helmets became painted with a matte finish, rather than the gloss still used for home games.\\r\\nThe Yankees have worn throwback uniforms on two special occasions. In 1996, the Yankees wore the uniforms of the New York Black Yankees on a day celebrating Negro league baseball. In 2012, the Yankees wore replicas of their 1912 uniforms, with an alternate interlocking N-Y logo and without numbers, for a game celebrating Fenway Park's centennial.[10]\\r\\nDuring a July 4, 2008 game against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees wore a special stars-and-stripes cap with an American flag pattern inside the interlocking N-Y. It was \\"thought to be the first time in their history\\" that the Yankees had worn a special edition cap. All other teams in Major League Baseball, including the Red Sox, sported similar designs inside their cap logos.[11]\\r\\nAs a Memorial Day promotion, the Yankees donned red caps with stars-and-stripes logos for a May 25, 2009 game against the Texas Rangers.[12] The Yankees also wore these caps for a July 4, 2009 game against the Toronto Blue Jays and for a September 11, 2009 game against the Baltimore Orioles.[13] The latter game is particularly notable, as it was the game in which Derek Jeter earned his 2,722nd base hit, breaking the franchise record held by Lou Gehrig.\\r\\nDuring the 2010 season, the Yankees wore special off-white caps with a similar stars-and-stripes logo in games played on Memorial Day, Independence Day weekend, and Patriot Day. Proceeds from sales of these caps support Welcome Back Veterans, a non-profit organization \\"targeting veterans' greatest needs, including mental health and job training/placement.\\" All United States-based teams wore similarly-styled caps on these days. (The one Canadian franchise wore a Maple Leaf design, owing to their national emblem.)[14]\\r\\nFor Memorial Day, 2013 (May 27) each Major League Baseball club wore caps and jerseys \\"featuring an authentic military digital camouflage design licensed from the United States Marine Corps.\\"[15] The Yankees, playing on the road at Citi Field, wore camouflage caps with a white \\"NY\\", and jerseys with camouflage \\"New York\\" on the front and camouflage numbers on the back.[16]\\r\\nThe Yankees uniform for 2017 Players Weekend was part of a league-wide initiative in which all 30 teams used special color pullover jerseys with contrasting sleeves, inspired by uniforms frequently used by youth baseball teams. All teams also wore special caps. Since the weekend coincided with the final days of the 2017 Little League World Series, all jerseys bore a unique logo that drew design cues from the MLB and Little League logos. The Yankees jersey was solid black with gray sleeves featuring the \\"YANKEES\\" script used since 1950 (dispensing with pinstripes for the first time in more than a century), and the team used a gray cap with the traditional interlocking \\"NY\\" logo. Also as part of the initiative, all uniforms had names on the back (a first for any official Yankees uniform), and players were encouraged to place nicknames instead of family names on their jerseysfor example, Aaron Judge's uniform that weekend had \\"ALL RISE\\" on the back. Brett Gardner and Tyler Austin became the first Yankees ever to have their last names on the back of their uniforms. [7][17]\\r\\nUnder George Steinbrenner, long hair and facial hair below the lip were prohibited;[18] the practice has been continued under Hal Steinbrenner since control of the Yankees was transferred to him after the 2008 season. Players who do not fit these criteria must shave the excess hair. In the past, visible tattoos were also prohibited[citation needed] and players wore navy blue arm bands to cover them,[citation needed] although this practice has since been discontinued.\\r\\nAlthough this is a policy that all baseball teams once had, the Yankees are currently the only team with such a policy (though former Chicago White Sox general manager Ken Williams was known for asking players to cut their hair, the club does not now nor during his time as GM have a policy banning long hair) and have gotten notoriety enforcing it. Many players, most notably Reggie Jackson, Jeff Reardon, Roger Clemens, Kevin Youkilis, Jason Giambi, Gary Sheffield, Johnny Damon, and Randy Johnson either had long hair, significant facial hair, or both before playing for the Yankees, but were clean-cut by the time they had their press conferences unveiling them as members of the Yankees.\\r\\nThere have been some defiances of the dress code, however. Most notable incident involved pitcher Goose Gossage, who had a horseshoe mustache in deliberate defiance of George Steinbrenner. Jackson, though he currently sports only a mustache as a \\"special assistant\\" with the organization, did have a full beard during parts of his stay with the Yankees. Don Mattingly, the face of the franchise for the 1980s and the first half the 1990s, was briefly benched in 1991 for letting his hair grow too long and the team did not let him play until it was cut, but was eventually reinserted into the lineup after it became apparent that he was not going to cut it.\\r\\nSeveral players, including Clemens, Giambi, Sheffield, Johnson, Damon, Andrew Miller, David Wells, and Joba Chamberlain, grew significant facial hair after their departures from the organization. Journeyman outfielder Darnell McDonald had long dreadlocks throughout his career and had to cut them when joining the Yankees despite only being on their roster for three days when the Yankees released him.\\r\\nThe Yankees are so well known with their dress code that players for other teams have been rumored to be signing for the Yankees if they adopt a clean-cut look before actually signing with them. In December 2012, San Francisco Giants pitcher Tim Lincecum, known for his long locks, cut his hair short. Although his hair was also short during his rookie season with the Giants in 2007, one Twitter commenter joked that he may have been preparing to play for the Yankees in 2014, since he was entering a contract year with the Giants in 2013.[19] Other players have refused to sign with the team due to these restrictions, such as Lincecum's teammate Brian Wilson, who said he would never shave his trademark beard to sign with the Yankees.[citation needed]","input":"What color are the new york yankees uniforms?"},{"output":"Mike Berenstain","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Berenstain Bears is a children's literature franchise created by Stan and Jan Berenstain and continued by their son, Mike Berenstain, who assumed partial authorship in 2002, and full authorship in 2012 following Jan's death. The books feature a family of anthropomorphic grizzly bears who generally learn a moral or safety-related lesson in the course of each story.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1962 debut of the first Berenstain Bears book, The Big Honey Hunt, the series has grown to over 300 titles, which have sold approximately 260 million copies in 23 languages.[1] The Berenstain Bears franchise has also expanded well beyond the books, encompassing two television series and a wide variety of other products and licenses. While enjoying decades of popularity and receiving numerous awards, the series has been criticized for its perceived saccharine tone and formulaic storytelling.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Berenstain and Janice Grant met in 1941, on their first day of drawing class at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art, where they formed an immediate bond.[3][4][5] After being separated during World War II, during which Stan worked for the Army as a medical illustrator and Janice worked as a riveter, they were reunited and married in 1946.[3] While initially working as art teachers, the Berenstains pursued a joint career in cartooning and gradually found success working together on illustrations, humorous sketches and cover art for publications including The Saturday Review of Literature, Collier's, McCall's, Good Housekeeping, and The Saturday Evening Post.[3][4][6] In 1951, they published Berenstains' Baby Book, a humorous how-to aimed at adults and based on their experiences raising their infant son Leo in downtown Philadelphia.[5] Nearly two dozen other books followed; described by Stan as \\"cartoon essays,\\" the titles included Marital Blitz, How To Teach Your Children About Sex Without Making A Complete Fool of Yourself and Have A Baby, My Wife Just Had A Cigar![5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, the Berenstains sought to enter the field of writing for young children.[3] For their first children's book, they chose to cast bears as the main characters, primarily because the animal held wide appeal and could be drawn easily.[3][5] Stan also observed that female bears are \\"terrifyingly good mothers\\" while the males are \\"lousy fathers.\\"[5] (The Berenstains denied that their last name had anything to do with the decision.)[5][7] In their 2002 memoir, they said that they knew from the start that their book would \\"have three characters: a bluff, overenthusiastic Papa Bear who wore bib overalls and a plaid shirt and...a wise Mama Bear who wore a blue dress with white polka dots...and a bright, lively little cub.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Berenstains' first bear story, titled Freddy Bear's Spanking, arrived on the desk of Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, who had found phenomenal success in 1957 with The Cat in the Hat and was now editor of a Random House series called \\"Beginner Books\\".[7] Geisel took on the manuscript, but spent the next two years ruthlessly challenging the Berenstains to make improvements to the writing and structure and to connect with their characters on a deeper level.[1][7][8] He asked questions such as \\"What kind of pipe tobacco does Papa Bear smoke?\\" and urged them to analyze the relationship between Papa Bear and Small Bear, to which Stan responded, mystified, \\"Well, he's the father, and he's the son\\"; however, Jan attributed the inspiration for the characters' dynamic to the 1931 film The Champ.[3][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book was finally published in 1962 under the title The Big Honey Hunt, with no plans to revisit the bears in a sequel.[5][7] Geisel had told the Berenstains to feature a different animal in their next story, as \\"there are already too many bears... Sendak's got some kind of bear. There's Yogi Bear, the Three Bears, Smokey Bear, the Chicago Bears... for your next book you should do something as different from bears as possible.\\"[6] They had started work on a new project featuring a penguin when Geisel called and told them: \\"We're selling the hell out of the bear book.\\"[5][6] The second bear book, The Bike Lesson, appeared in 1964, featuring the names Stan and Jan Berenstain instead of Stanley and Janice; Geisel had changed the credit without consulting them. Geisel was also responsible for adding the name \\"Berenstain Bears\\" to the covers of succeeding books.[5][6][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next several decades, Stan and Jan collaborated on hundreds of books from their home studio outside Philadelphia.[1][6] After developing a storyline together, one of them (usually Stan) would develop a first draft, which the other would then refine into an 1100-word manuscript. They also worked together on the illustrations.[5] In 2002, the couple released a memoir of their career titled Down A Sunny Dirt Road.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sons Leo and Mike also entered the family business after making their own forays into children's publishing as an author and illustrator, respectively.[7] In the 1990s, the men worked on the Berenstain Bears \\"Big Chapter Book\\" series (published under the names Stan and Jan Berenstain).[7]  Following Stan's death from lymphoma in 2005, Mike collaborated with his mother on writing and illustrating Berenstain Bears installments, while Leo has been involved with the business side of the franchise.[1] Jan Berenstain died in February 2012 following a stroke.[11][12] Mike Berenstain continues to write and illustrate new books in the series.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Berenstain Bears, who reside \\"in a big treehouse down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country,\\" consists of Papa Bear, an oafish, bumbling carpenter; wise Mama Bear, a housewife and perfectionist; and their children, Brother Bear (originally Small Bear), and later additions Sister Bear and Honey Bear.[3][7][14] Sister Bear was introduced in the 1974 book The Berenstain Bears' New Baby in response to requests from female readers.[8] Honey Bear's imminent arrival was announced in early 2000 in The Birds, the Bees, and the Berenstain Bears, along with a reader contest to name the new bear; her birth was featured later that year in The Berenstain Bears and Baby Makes Five.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nStories about the bears generally follow a basic formula, so described by the Berenstains: \\"Papa sets out to instruct Small Bear in some aspect of the art of living and ends up badly the worse for wear, with Small Bear expressing his appreciation for the fine lesson Papa has taught him.\\"[6] In the words of The Washington Post's Paul Farhi, \\"The action usually starts when the kids face a problem. They turn to Papa,  who offers a \\"solution\\" that only makes the problemor the kids' fears about iteven worse. Enter Mama, who eventually sets everyone straight.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe litany of issues confronted by the Berenstain Bears over their fifty years of publication include bullying, messiness, poor sportsmanship, visiting the dentist, online safety, and childhood obesity, among countless others.[1][5][17] The Berenstains often drew inspiration from their own family experiences, which Stan credited for the series' continued relevance: \\"Kids still tell fibs and they mess up their rooms and they still throw tantrums in the supermarket...Nobody gets shot. No violence. There are problems, but they're the kind of typical family problems everyone goes through.\\"[4][8] The couple also claimed, in response to criticism of the characterization of Papa and Mama Bear, that those characters were heavily inspired by Stan and Jan Berenstain themselves.[5][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Berenstain Bears series had sold over 240 million copies by 2003. Of their books, 35 are in the Publishers Weekly top 250 titles of all time, and 15 are in the top 100 childrens paperbacks.[18] The series has received praise and awards for its contributions to children's literature[19] as well as condemnation for promoting outdated gender roles, simplistic and unrealistic messages, and not keeping up with the times.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics of the series have called it \\"syrupy\\", \\"unsatisfying\\", \\"infuriatingly formulaic\\", \\"hokey\\", \\"abominable\\", and \\"little more than stern lectures dressed up as children's stories.\\"[2][7][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 1989 editorial titled \\"Drown the Berenstain Bears\\", Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer lamented the popularity of the books, writing that \\"it is not just the smugness and complacency of the stories that is so irritating,\\" but the bears themselves, particularly \\"the post-feminist Papa Bear, the Alan Alda of grizzlies, a wimp so passive and fumbling he makes Dagwood Bumstead look like Batman.\\" He described Mama Bear as \\"the final flowering of the grade-school prissy, the one with perfect posture and impeccable handwriting...and now you have to visit her every night. The reason is, of course, that kids love them. My boy, 4, cannot get enough of these bears.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the death of Stan Berenstain in 2005, the Washington Post published an \\"Appreciation\\" piece which many Post readers found surprisingly unappreciative in its tone. Written by Paul Farhi, who had previously rebuked the Berenstain Bears as the most popular example of a lamentable and misguided \\"self-help\\" genre aimed at children,[2] the 2005 piece revived his earlier sentiments:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe larger questions about the popularity of the Berenstain Bears are more troubling: Is this what we really want from children's books in the first place, a world filled with scares and neuroses and problems to be toughed out and solved? And if it is, aren't the Berenstain Bears simply teaching to the test, providing a lesson to be spit back, rather than one lived and understood and embraced? Where is the warmth, the spirit of discovery and imagination in Bear Country? Stan Berenstain taught a million lessons to children, but subtlety and plain old joy weren't among them.[16]\\r\\nSubsequent letters from readers condemned Farhi for expressing such harshness toward the recently deceased; one wrote, \\"In the name of fairness, please be sure to allow the Berenstain family the opportunity to someday retort in Farhi's obituary.\\"[23] Readers also defended the books' \\"warmth\\" and their enduring popularity among young children.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSlate's Hanna Rosin revived Krauthammer's complaints, drawing criticism for writing of Jan Berenstain's death, \\"As any right-thinking mother will agree, good riddance. Among my set of mothers the series is known mostly as the one that makes us dread the bedtime routine the most.\\" (Rosin subsequently apologized and admitted she \\"was not really thinking of [Berenstain] as a person with actual feelings and a family, just an abstraction who happened to write these books.\\")[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Berenstain Bears series has been awarded the Ludington Award from the Educational Paperback Association for their contribution to children's literature, the Drexel Citation from Drexel University, several Philadelphia Literary Children's Roundtable Honors, and many other state reading association awards.[18][19][27][28][29] Following Jan Berenstain's death in 2012, acclaimed children's author Jerry Spinelli said that \\"the Berenstains made a wonderful and lasting contribution to children's literature.\\" Author and professor Donna Jo Napoli said, \\"Those bears have helped so many children through so many kinds of challenges that kids face, in such a cheerful and kind of energetic way.\\"[11] The Washington Post's Alexandra Petri wrote that the books were \\"timeless, timely, and kind-hearted, like all the best literature,\\" and acknowledged the Post's 1989 piece by saying, \\"This is one of the times the kids have the right idea and Charles Krauthammer does not.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Berenstain Bears' creation, the characters have been widely licensed for a broad array of products. The franchise exploded in size in the 1980s, when King Features began aggressively promoting the Bears to marketers amidst a surge in popularity following a series of animated television specials. As of 1983, the Berenstain Bears had been licensed to approximately 40 companies for more than 150 types of products, with projected annual sales of $50 million.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Berenstain Bears first appeared on television in five animated specials on NBC, airing as follows:[7][9][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first special starred Ron McLarty, Gabriela Glatzer, Jonathan Lewis, and Pat Lysinger as Papa, Sister, Brother and Mama, respectively.  Most reprised their roles in the subsequent specials.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1985 through 1987, an animated series titled The Berenstain Bears Show aired as part of CBS' Saturday morning cartoon block.[40][41][42][43] The series was nominated in 1987 for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in Children's Programming; it was also nominated that year for a Humanitas Prize in the category of Non-Prime Time Children's Animated Show.[44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nA second TV series, also called The Berenstain Bears, debuted on PBS in 2003. The series was produced by the Canadian company Nelvana and consisted of 80 15-minute episodes adapted from the books and also a few new stories as well, similar to the 1985 production.[8][9] However, the series are considered separate adaptations and were never aired together. Even though the 2003 series is not a remake but a continuation of the episodes, some characters personalities changed while other characters no longer appeared. (However, new characters appeared.) The original specials and TV series have a rustic design and interaction with other forest animals while the Nelvana series completely embraced rural life with slower timing. Additionally, due to Canadian laws requiring Nelvana to employ only Canadian writers and artists, the Berenstains' involvement in the program was limited; They sought to exert their influence on some details, according to Stan. \\"Our bears don't wear shoes, and Papa wouldn't wear his hat in the house...And we try to keep complete, total banality out of the stories.\\"[8] Common practicalities of animation did force some minor costume changes from the books, such as eliminating polka dots and plaids. (This issue also occurred in previous animated series and specials. Only a limited amount of polka dots was allowed in the five specials.)[9] The show's theme song is performed by Lee Ann Womack.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, 20 episodes of the Nelvana series were dubbed with the Native American Lakota language and began airing on public television in North and South Dakota under the title Mat?܇ Wa~??ila Thiwhe (\\"The Compassionate Bear Family\\"). The translated series was a collaboration of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and the nonprofit Lakota Language Consortium, with Mike Berenstain and Nelvana waiving all licensing fees for the venture. The Berenstain Bears is the first animated series to be translated into a Native American language in the United States.[46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral computer games and other software adaptations of the Berenstain Bears books have been released, including the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2002, an exhibit titled \\"The Berenstain Bears Celebrate: The Art of Stan and Jan Berenstain\\" opened at the James A. Michener Art Museum in the Berenstains' home of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Organized by the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and timed to coincide with the release of the Berenstains' memoir Down A Sunny Dirt Road, the exhibit provided a retrospective of the couple's artwork, influences and techniques, as well as the evolution of their famous bears. The exhibit was subsequently hosted by the Rockwell Museum in 2003.[57][58][59][60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, the Lied Discovery Children's Museum in Las Vegas, Nevada, opened \\"Growing Up With the Berenstain Bears\\", an exhibition offering children the chance to experience life-size versions of Bear Country landmarks. The Youth Museum Exhibit Collaborative and the Berenstains themselves assisted in the exhibit's development.[62] The exhibition visited eight other museums in the United States and Canada before returning to Lied Discovery Children's Museum in 2010.[63][64][65][66][67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, is host to a permanent exhibit, \\"The Berenstain Bears  Down a Sunny Dirt Road.\\" Opened in 2008, the original exhibition features interactive 3D playsets such as Mama Bear's Quilt Shop, Papa Bear's Woodworking Shop, and Dr. Bearson's Dentist Office.[68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe off-Broadway musical The Berenstain Bears LIVE! in Family Matters, the Musical debuted in June 2011 at MMAC (Manhattan Movie and Arts Center) in New York City, after having toured the country in an earlier version. Originally scheduled to run from June to September 4, the show was extended through October and subsequently moved to the Marjorie S. Deane Little Theatre for an open-ended run.[70] The show was produced by Berenstain fan Matt Murphy, whose previous work included Memphis and Altar Boyz.[71] Improper Magazine called it \\"a genuinely enjoyable and enriching experience for kids\\", while The New York Times said that \\"little theatergoers will enjoy the actors\\" but the story was \\"a bit too tidy and tame.\\"[17][72]\\r\\n\\r\\nA planned Berenstain Bears feature film adaptation was announced in 2009 by Walden Media and director Shawn Levy, whose company 21 Laps would produce the film. The project was envisioned as a comedy with both live action and computer-animated elements, and an original storyline that would combine details from several Berenstain books. \\"I'd like the film to be un-ironic about its family connections but have a wry comedic sensibility that isn't oblivious to the fact that they're bears,\\" Levy said. Comparing it to the film Elf, Levy said he thought the Berenstain Bears film would be \\"witty but never sarcastic.\\"[73] As of January 2012, the project was reportedly in the script phase.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the Berenstain Bears became the \\"spokesbears\\" for Prevent Child Abuse America. Said PCA America President and CEO Jim Hmurovich: \\"This is a great example of a socially conscious and child focused business taking a stand on an issue that has great consequences for all of us. This helps us begin having a more honest conversation about how each of us has a role to prevent the abuse and neglect of our nation's children.\\"[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Berenstains were approached by former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who asked them to write an anti-smoking book for children. They declined, but the idea did lead to a 1988 book about peer pressure, The Berenstain Bears and the Double Dare.[7] In 1997, they published The Berenstain Bear Scouts and the Sinister Smoke Ring; Florida governor Lawton Chiles purchased 600,000 copies of the book to distribute to children as part of his anti-smoking campaign.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 2008, a number of Berenstain Bears titles of a specifically religious nature have been released by Mike Berenstain. These include The Berenstain Bears: God Loves You, The Berenstain Bears Say Their Prayers and a Berenstain Bears Bible - Complete New International Reader's Version written at a third-grade reading level. The titles are part of a series called Living Lights and are published by the Christian company Zondervan and HarperCollins.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2012, the publishers of the series faced a controversy regarding the fast food restaurant Chick-fil-A's plan to distribute titles in the series as part of a kids' meal promotion, with gay rights advocates urging the publishers to pull out of the promotion, due to the Chick-fil-A founder's controversial statements regarding same-sex marriage. HarperCollins responded by stating that it was not their \\"...practice to cancel a contract with an author, or any other party, for exercising their first amendment rights.\\"[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, the prominent vaccine manufacturer Lederle Laboratories licensed the Berenstain Bears for a promotional campaign encouraging children to get vaccinated. As part of the campaign, Lederle distributed Berenstain Bears stuffed animals and books to every pediatrician's office in the United States.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, many Cedar Fair theme parks, including Cedar Point, featured kids' play areas called \\"Berenstain Bear Country\\" that were themed to the franchise. The Berenstain Bears could also be found at the parks as costumed characters.[79][80][81][82][83]\\r\\n\\r\\nA musical album titled The Berenstain Bears Save Christmas: The Musical! was released by Good Mood Records in 2006. Adapted from the 2003 book The Berenstain Bears Save Christmas, the album teamed the Berenstains with the father-son composing team of Elliot Lawrence and Jamie Broza, the former of whom composed music for the holiday television specials and original television series.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther products that have featured the Berenstain Bears include clothing, Happy Meals, cereal, chocolate, crackers, greeting cards, puzzles, embroidery kits, and notepads.[3][7][16][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people incorrectly remember the name of the series as the \\"Berenstein Bears\\". This confusion has generated multiple theories to explain the memories, including an unannounced name change, time travel, or parallel universes and has been described as an instance of the Mandela effect.[85][86][87][88] According to Stan Berenstain's son, confusion over the name has existed since his father's childhood, when a teacher insisted that the name was spelled \\"Berenstein\\" due to the prevalence of names ending in \\"stein\\".[89] A few examples of the \\"Berenstein\\" spelling have been found in references to and knockoffs of official merchandise[90] and publications,[91] and cartoons for the series used an ambiguous pronunciation which may contribute to the false-memory.[92]","input":"Who is the author of the berenstain bears books?"},{"output":"Lacey Chabert","context":"1998 Pilot Pitch of Family Guy (Early version)\\r\\nMegan \\"Meg\\" Griffin is a character from the American animated television series Family Guy.

She is treated unfairly by her parents and her insecurities cause her to try desperately to be part of the cool crowd, which only results in her getting coldly rebuffed by Connie D'Amico,[1] the popular and beautiful yet mean-spirited and cocky head cheerleader of her school. However, another student named Neil Goldman is attracted to her.[2] She is also usually at the bottom of the family's pecking order and the butt of Peter's jokes due to her homeliness, tendency toward social awkwardness, and unpopularity. Everyone in her family makes fun of her: Peter and Chris resort to outrageous stunts and names; Stewie and Brian employ subtle but effective jokes, but typically choose not to verbalize them in front of Meg; Lois constantly puts Meg down while boosting her own egotistical image. However, in the episode \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\", she strongly insults and defames her family for their actions against her, causing them to distance themselves in shame and sending Peter and Lois into a depression, though she later apologizes. On one occasion, the whole family even goes as far as to read her diary and mock her deepest secrets. However, on some occasions the family's true love for her has been proven. She has been so self-conscious and insecure about herself that she has engaged in dangerous sexual behavior just for attention. She is also prone to violent releases of her repressed rage, as shown in \\"Road to Rupert\\", when she assaults a man who insulted her after a fender-bender. Many of the show's \\"Meg\\" storylines involve her trying to improve her typical life, trying to find a boyfriend, and reaching breaking points with her family and other bullies. In the episode \\"Chris Cross\\", it's strongly hinted that Meg is working with Dutch neo-Nazis when she orders Chris to retrieve mail she receives from the Netherlands at a private post office box, saying she's \\"sort of part of a group that trashes the Anne Frank house every spring.\\"\\r\\nOn the season 1 DVD commentary for the Drawn Together episode \\"Hot Tub\\", Cree Summer claims she was offered the role to play Meg but was dismissed by the producers. Meg was voiced by an uncredited Lacey Chabert for the first season, and by Mila Kunis in subsequent seasons after Chabert became busy with school and appearing on Party of Five at the time,[3] although some of her work became second season episodes due to production order. Mila Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show.[4] MacFarlane called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak more slowly, and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.[4] MacFarlane stated that Kunis \\"had a very natural quality to Meg\\" and she's \\"in a lot of ways [...] almost more right for the character\\". Kunis's voice is first heard as Meg in Episode 3 of season two \\"Da Boom\\", and the voices switch back and forth in the broadcast order until settling on Kunis.[5] Tara Strong provides Meg's singing voice in \\"Don't Make Me Over\\".[6]\\r\\nMeg typically wears glasses and a pink beanie even underneath other headgear. She also commonly wears a pink and white T-shirt, blue jeans, and tan (later white) shoes. She occasionally is seen wearing dresses or formal wear usually without her trademark cap. She is slightly shorter than her younger brother Chris. Meg is also self-conscious about her appearance (\\"I'm so fat and gross.\\").[10]\\r\\nMeg is very unpopular in high school due to her plain appearance and personality. Meg desperately tries to be part of the cool crowd, but is usually coldly rebuffed. She is also usually the butt of Peter's jokes due to her perceived homeliness and tendency towards social awkwardness. Because of her eagerness for acceptance, she has been recruited unknowingly into a suicidal religious cult,[11] and later recruited again unwittingly into her school's Lesbian Alliance (\\"Brian Sings and Swings\\").[12] However, Meg does have a moderate number of friends, the best of which being with a group of girls who are often seen with her during occasions such as her slumber parties and gossiping about boys.[13] In later episodes, these girls, known by the names Beth, Patty, Collette, Esther, and Ruth, are characterized as being highly unpopular and dateless, much like Meg, even saying that she was the only one of them who ever had a boyfriend (actually a decaying corpse she was \\"dating\\").\\r\\nMeg is so unpopular at school that one student fires a nail gun into his own stomach twice (in shop class) in order to avoid a date with her, and then in a later episode shoots his own brother as an excuse not to go to a dance with her the following night. On another occasion, Meg and Lois are looking for new clothes for Meg, but with no luck (a saleswoman ended up pouring gasoline on herself, lighting a match, catching fire, and then jumping out of a window after looking at Meg in a pair of jeans). However, she is sought by nerd Neil Goldman. In \\"8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter\\", Neil starts dating a girl named Cecilia, Meg becomes instantly jealous and pretends to date Jake Tucker to make him jealous. This leads to her signing a contract to become Neil's girlfriend and (not knowing at first) his slave, but she gets him to tear up the contract after Lois seduces him. Perverted neighbor Glenn Quagmire has shown a repeated interest in her, mostly due to his very low standards, asking if she has reached the age of consent. Quagmire comes close to succeeding when Lois tells Peter to back off after he was ruining Meg and Quagmire's 'dates'. Then, they rescue Meg after Glenn takes her to his cabin, Peter and Lois arriving in time before anything happens.[14] In several episodes she is shown dating, including stories with characters Mayor Adam West[15] and nudist Jeff Campbell.[16] She also loses her virginity unknowingly on live television to Saturday Night Live host Jimmy Fallon after having a drastic makeover; but, before all that happens, she goes out with a rebel at her school named Craig Hoffman.[17] In \\"Jerome is the New Black\\", Jerome, an old flame of Lois's and Peter's new friend, admits to having sex with Meg, to which Peter replies indifferently.\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Brian Sings and Swings\\", a lesbian student named Sarah invites Meg to join in her Lesbian Alliance Club, with Meg not knowing at first what kind of club it was. Desperate to fit in, she pretends to be a lesbian and also pretends to be attracted to Sarah and even goes so far as to kiss her to prove it. At the end of the episode, Meg goes over to Sarah's house to admit she lied about being a lesbian (Sarah thought that Meg came over to have sex and even undresses when Meg is telling her that she lied), much to Glenn's (who was hiding in Sarah's closet) disappointment. She also used to have a crush on anchorman Tom Tucker, but it ended after she discovered his vanity and selfishness.\\r\\nIn other episodes, she is portrayed as chronically incapable of finding a boyfriend. For her Junior Prom she accepts a pity date from Brian, the family dog and only after threatening suicide.[10]\\r\\nEarlier in season 2, she dated Joe Swanson's son Kevin Swanson, but in \\"Stew-Roids\\" it is mentioned that Kevin died in Iraq. In the episode, \\"Prick Up Your Ears\\", she dates a boy named Doug, but he breaks up with her when he sees her naked right before almost having sex. In the episode \\"Peter's Daughter\\", Meg falls in love with a medical student named Michael Milano after coming out of a short coma (caused by Peter when he asked her to \\"rescue\\" beer and make him a sandwich out of an already flooded kitchen) and they start to date. After he breaks up with Meg (because of Peter being overprotective of her after promising that if she came out of the coma, he would \\"treat her like a princess\\"), she announces that she is pregnant by Michael and the two get engaged. After finding out that she is not actually pregnant, Meg tells Michael the truth hoping that he will stay, however, Michael quickly leaves Meg at the altar. In the episode \\"Dial Meg for Murder\\", she is dating a convict, while in the episode \\"Go, Stewie, Go!\\" she dates an attractive young man named Anthony, who is absolutely normal (much to the surprise and chagrin of many of the other characters). They were so shocked that they had to do tests just to see if he was completely normal which annoyed Meg. It is presumed that she broke up with him after he and Lois had an affair.\\r\\nMeg also shows extremely possessive behavior when she encounters someone she believes she has a romantic connection with such as kidnapping Brian and detaining Bonnie Swanson at the airport by planting a gun in her purse.\\r\\nMeg has shown romantic interest in and dated several men throughout the series. However, there have been several instances in which she has shown hints of bisexuality or lesbianism: examples of this include \\"Brian Sings and Swings\\", \\"Stew-Roids\\", and \\"Dial Meg for Murder\\".\\r\\nIn November 2016, when asked by Splitsider if the writers will further develop the characters of Chris and Meg in future episodes, showrunner Alec Sulkin confirmed that the series crew members are working on doing so and added that there are plans for an episode where Meg comes out as a lesbian, taking inspiration from previous instances in which she exhibited signs of lesbian characteristics, like when she joins a lesbian alliance group at school in \\"Brian Sings and Swings\\" and is identified as a transgender man named \\"Ron\\" in Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, the latter which takes place in the future. However, Sulkin also noted that the plotline has not yet been finalized and thus isn't officially set to be used in an episode.[18][19]\\r\\nIn the first three seasons of the show, Meg's family often inadvertently humiliated her due to their bumbling or stupidity, though they cared for her and meant well. In the post-cancellation seasons, this began to change as the show started to flesh out the characters to the point where it seems that most of the population of Quahog, including her own family, despise her for no reason other than her simply being \\"Meg\\".[20] In an interview, Mila Kunis stated: \\"Meg gets picked on a lot. But it's funny. It's like the middle child. She is constantly in the state of being an awkward 14-year-old, when you're kind of going through puberty and what-not. She's just in perpetual mode of humiliation, and it's fun.\\"[21]\\r\\nMeg is also the most misunderstood, at least by Peter, Chris, and others who are shown avoiding her company, disparaging her in person, gathering in her bedroom to read her diary for laughs, etc.[22] Peter reminds Lois, \\"We agreed that if we could only save two, we'd leave Meg!\\"[23] even randomly shooting her when she simply said \\"Hi Dad\\" (\\"Peter's Daughter\\") but despite this he also was going to say \\"I love you\\" in \\"Hell Comes to Quahog\\", and in \\"Road to Rupert\\" he stated they were 'secret best friends' before throwing lemonade in her face, saying he would have to continue to treat her badly in public in order to maintain his reputation due to \\"peer pressure\\", thus giving hope that they may be on good terms. Occasionally, when Meg asks a question to Peter or just speaks when he is in the room, Peter responds by saying \\"Shut up, Meg,\\" which is immediately followed by a line from another character.\\r\\nWhen the family tries an anger management technique of writing letters and not sending them, Meg finds Peter's letter to her, which says, \\"Dear Meg, for the first four years of your life, I thought you were a house cat.\\" [24] And in Peter's short story of her birth, they had to go back to get her once they realized they grabbed the afterbirth. In the episode \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\", Peter tells guests on a cruise ship about how he and Lois had gone to get an abortion but decided against it when they arrived at the clinic and found out the abortionist had one hand. He then says \\"two and a half months later, our daughter Meg was born\\" ÿ indicating that they had tried to abort her when Lois was already over six months pregnant. Another hint to this is when Meg is in the car with Lois and at an attempt to make civilized conversation, says, \\"Hey Meg, did you know that if you're on birth control and you take an antibiotic it makes it not work? 'Cause no one told me! I just thought you should know\\" and laughs awkwardly. On Meg's 17th birthday, her mother and father both try to hide from Meg that they do not remember her age.[25] Peter openly states that Meg sucks in the episode \\"PTV\\", and Chris says the same thing about her in \\"Long John Peter\\". In \\"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\\", Brian says to Meg's face that she lives in a home \\"where nobody respects or cares about [her], not even enough to get [her] a damn mumps shot!\\" Chris, however, seems to have more of a typical brother-sister relationship with Meg. Although they fight and argue from time to time, he tends to go to her for advice. Chris even once threatened to quit his job if his boss didn't re-hire Meg (at the insistence of Lois).[26] Like Chris, Meg has an anthropomorphic monkey in her closet, and although she has proved it, her family coldly state that they were talking about Chris', not hers. Cleveland comments to Peter \\"Meg is my least favorite of your children.\\"[27]\\r\\nApparently, a double standard also exists against Meg, further underscoring the mistreatment she suffers from the people around her. In \\"Big Man on Hippocampus\\", an episode wherein Peter loses his memory, as he reacquaints himself with the pleasures of sex, Lois tells him that it is inappropriate to have sex with his own children; in response, Meg attempts an incest joke. Most of the family lambaste her for this and Chris kicks her out of the room.[28] However, in the season finale \\"Partial Terms of Endearment\\", Lois tells a joke that implies that it was Meg that gave birth to Stewie, and apart from a shocked reaction from the latter, Lois receives no such violent reaction.[29] Additionally, in \\"Model Misbehavior\\", when Lois starts a modeling career, Peter states that he will pleasure himself to Lois' pictures, followed by Chris and Meg both exclaiming \\"Me too!\\" to which Peter shouts \\"Oh God, Meg, that's sick! That's your mother!\\", ignoring the fact that Chris said the same thing. Meg responded by saying \\"I was only trying to fit in!\\" Peter immediately kicked her out of the house. Later, during an unrelated conversation, when she spoke, he said \\"Meg, who let you back in the house?\\"\\r\\nBrian's attention softens the lack of respect from Peter and the neighbors; he admits that he cares for Meg when she goes out with Mayor Adam West. Lois has also often shown sympathy for Meg, for example, taking her to Spring Break at the beach. Lois very often comforts Meg when she is down; however, she gives up one attempt after 45 minutes and gives her a Sylvia Plath novel and a bottle of Ambien, and with a \\"Whatever happens, happens,\\" leaves Meg to her misery.[27] One of the most cruel examples comes in the episode \\"You Can't Do That On Television, Peter\\". When Peter is mauled by a puma, Meg uses medical training to save his life. However, no one thanks her afterward and when she tries to point it out, Peter just tells her to get him water.\\r\\nThe family's treatment of Meg finally reaches her limit in \\"Dial Meg for Murder\\" when Meg emerges from a short stint in a Young Offenders Institution as a hardened criminal, abusing her family and beating up anyone who makes fun of her. It is only after a conversation with Brian that she changes her ways. However, it comes to a head once again in \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\", when Meg finally grows tired of her mistreatment and lashes out against Chris, Lois, and Peter, informing them of their own flaws. She starts with Chris by calling him \\"a bastard\\" for being a terrible brother to her, berating him for all the ill treatment he has given her over the years, and how he never takes her side when their parents abuse her. Lois Griffin condescendingly tells Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else invoking Meg to bring up her mother's delinquent past. Meg tells her that she is far from the perfect parent, harshly berates her for constantly and ruthlessly pointing out Meg's shortcomings. Lois tries to justify that she's a better person because of her past and she is open that she isn't the perfect parent, but Meg tells her that she's the farthest thing from and states how she has neglected to protect her from harm and guide her through life. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns 18, she may never want to see her again.\\r\\nThis breaks Lois' heart and she finally admits that she's been a terrible mother to Meg. Finally, Meg turns on Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing, even when she points out Peter's destructive tendencies and that he would go to jail if someone could witness his negative treatment towards her. It dawns on Peter that he is being insulted when Meg calls him a \\"waste of a man.\\" A shocked Peter asks Lois to tell Meg to \\"knock it off,\\" but Lois refuses because he didn't stick up for her. Within moments, Peter, Lois and Chris turn their abusive criticisms and insults on each other. Peter finally runs to his room crying (with Chris telling Meg he faked all of his orgasms), leaving Meg and Brian, who is now fully recovered from his trip (he had taken magic mushrooms prior to the argument), to discuss what just happened. Brian is proud that Meg stood up for herself, but she sadly tells him that even though she meant every word, seeing her family turn on each other like wild animals has made her think that it is ultimately her non-ideal role to serve as the Griffins' lightning rod and \\"absorb all the dysfunction\\". He commends her on her maturity, and even goes on to say that Meg is the \\"strongest person\\" in the family. She soon apologizes to the others and says that she is the one at fault; Chris calls her a bitch, to which she proudly responds \\"Yes, yes I am,\\" and the family reconciles. Since this episode, Meg has been less prominent in the series and the abuse towards her slowly fades away as a storyline. Meg also notices that Peter's pro wrestler sister Karen treats Peter exactly the way Peter treats her, and they bond over this with a plan to embarrass Karen at a wrestling show--which goes awry when Meg hits her with a metal folding chair instead of a breakaway one and injures Karen to the point where she ends up in a coma and (as it is implied) possibly will die from her injuries without a blood transfusion.","input":"Who did the original voice of meg griffin?"},{"output":"\\"Auld Lang Syne\\"","context":"\\"Auld Lang Syne\\" (Scots pronunciation:?[???l(d) l??s?in]: note \\"s\\" rather than \\"z\\")[1] is a Scots poem written by Robert Burns in 1788[2][3] and set to the tune of a traditional folk song (Roud # 6294). It is well known in many countries, especially in the English-speaking world, its traditional use being to bid farewell to the old year at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. By extension, it is also sung at funerals, graduations, and as a farewell or ending to other occasions. The international Scouting movement, in many countries, uses it to close jamborees and other functions.[4]\\r\\nThe song's Scots title may be translated into standard English as \\"old long since\\", or more idiomatically, \\"long long ago\\",[5] \\"days gone by\\" or \\"old times\\". Consequently, \\"For auld lang syne\\", as it appears in the first line of the chorus, might be loosely translated as \\"for (the sake of) old times\\".\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton (1570ÿ1638), Allan Ramsay (1686ÿ1757), and James Watson (1711) as well as older folk songs predating Burns.[6] Matthew Fitt uses the phrase \\"In the days of auld lang syne\\" as the equivalent of \\"Once upon a time...\\" in his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Burns sent a copy of the original song to the Scots Musical Museum with the remark, \\"The following song, an old song, of the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in manuscript until I took it down from an old man.\\"[8] Some of the lyrics were indeed \\"collected\\" rather than composed by the poet; the ballad \\"Old Long Syne\\" printed in 1711 by James Watson shows considerable similarity in the first verse and the chorus to Burns' later poem,[6] and is almost certainly derived from the same \\"old song\\".\\r\\nShould Old Acquaintance be forgot,\\r\\nand never thought upon;\\r\\nThe flames of Love extinguished,\\r\\nand fully past and gone:\\r\\nIs thy sweet Heart now grown so cold,\\r\\nthat loving Breast of thine;\\r\\nThat thou canst never once reflect\\r\\nOn old long syne.\\r\\nIt is a fair supposition to attribute the rest of the poem to Burns himself.[8]\\r\\nThere is some doubt as to whether the melody used today is the same one Burns originally intended, but it is widely used in Scotland and in the rest of the world.[3][9]\\r\\nSinging the song on Hogmanay or New Year's Eve very quickly became a Scots custom that soon spread to other parts of the British Isles. As Scots (not to mention English, Welsh and Irish people) emigrated around the world, they took the song with them.\\r\\nThe song begins by posing a rhetorical question: Is it right that old times be forgotten? The answer is generally interpreted as a call to remember long-standing friendships.[10] Thomson's Select Songs of Scotland was published in 1799 in which the second verse about greeting and toasting was moved to its present position at the end.[10]\\r\\nMost common use of the song involves only the first verse and the chorus. The last lines of both of these are often sung with the extra words \\"For the sake of\\" or \\"And days of\\", rather than Burns' simpler lines. This allows one note for each word, rather than the slight melisma required to fit Burns' original words to the melody.\\r\\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot,\\r\\nand never brought to mind?\\r\\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot,\\r\\nand auld lang syne*?\\r\\nAnd surely ye'll be your pint-stoup!\\r\\nand surely I'll be mine!\\r\\nAnd we'll tak' a cup o kindness yet,\\r\\nfor auld lang syne.\\r\\nWe twa hae run about the braes,\\r\\nand pou'd the gowans fine;\\r\\nBut we've wander'd mony a weary fit,\\r\\nsin' auld lang syne.\\r\\nWe twa hae paidl'd in the burn,\\r\\nfrae morning sun till dine;\\r\\nBut seas between us braid hae roar'd\\r\\nsin' auld lang syne.\\r\\nAnd there's a hand, my trusty fiere!\\r\\nand gie's a hand o' thine!\\r\\nAnd we'll tak' a right gude-willie waught,\\r\\nfor auld lang syne.\\r\\nShould old acquaintance be forgot,\\r\\nand never brought to mind?\\r\\nShould old acquaintance be forgot,\\r\\nand old lang syne?\\r\\nAnd surely you'll buy your pint cup!\\r\\nand surely I'll buy mine!\\r\\nAnd we'll take a cup o' kindness yet,\\r\\nfor auld lang syne.\\r\\nWe two have run about the slopes,\\r\\nand picked the daisies fine;\\r\\nBut we've wandered many a weary foot,\\r\\nsince auld lang syne.\\r\\nWe two have paddled in the stream,\\r\\nfrom morning sun till dine?;\\r\\nBut seas between us broad have roared\\r\\nsince auld lang syne.\\r\\nAnd there's a hand my trusty friend!\\r\\nAnd give me a hand o' thine!\\r\\nAnd we'll take a right good-will draught,\\r\\nfor auld lang syne.\\r\\nShid ald akwentans bee firgot,\\r\\nan nivir brocht? ti mynd?\\r\\nShid ald akwentans bee firgot,\\r\\nan ald lang syn*?\\r\\nAn sheerly yil bee yur pynt-staup!\\r\\nan sheerly al bee myn!\\r\\nAn will tak a cup o kyndnes yet,\\r\\nfir ald lang syn.\\r\\nWe twa hay rin aboot the braes,\\r\\nan pood the gowans fyn;\\r\\nBit weev wandert monae a weery fet,\\r\\nsin ald lang syn.\\r\\nWe twa hay pedilt in the burn,\\r\\nfray mornin sun til dyn;\\r\\nBut seas between us bred hay roard\\r\\nsin ald lang syn.\\r\\nAn thers a han, my trustee feer!\\r\\nan gees a han o thyn!\\r\\nAnd we'll tak a richt? gude-willie-waucht?,\\r\\nfir ald lang syn.\\r\\n??d o??ld ?.kw?n.t?ns bi f??.ot,\\r\\n?n n?.v?? br?xt t? m?in?\\r\\n??d o??ld ?.kw?n.t?ns bi f??.ot,\\r\\n?n o??l l? s?in?\\r\\n?n ?e?r.li ji?l bi ju?? p?in.st?up!\\r\\n?n ?e?r.li ?l bi m?in!\\r\\n?n wi?l tk ? k?p ? k?in.n?s j?t,\\r\\nf?? o??l l? s?in.\\r\\nwi two??? he? r?n ?.but e? bre?z,\\r\\n?n pu?d e? ?u.?nz f?in;\\r\\nb?t wi?v wn.??t m?.ne ? wi??? f?t,\\r\\ns?n o??l l? s?in.\\r\\nwi two??? he? pe.dlt ?n e? b??n,\\r\\nfre? mo??.n?n s?n t?l d?in;\\r\\nb?t si?z ?.twin ?s bred he? ro?rd\\r\\ns?n o?l? l? s?in.\\r\\n?n ee?rz ? ho??n, m tr?s.t? fi??!\\r\\n?? i?z ? ho??n ? e?in!\\r\\n?n wi?l tk ? r?xt ?d w?.l? wo??xt,\\r\\nf?? o?l? l? s?in.\\r\\n? dine = \\"dinner time\\"\\r\\n? ch = voiceless velar fricative, /x/, at the back of the mouth like /k/ but with the mouth partly open like /f/.

The contention that Burns borrowed the melody from Shield is for various reasons highly unlikely, although they may very well both have taken it from a common source, possibly a strathspey called The Miller's Wedding or The Miller's Daughter. The problem is that tunes based on the same set of dance steps necessarily have a similar rhythm, and even a superficial resemblance in melodic shape may cause a very strong apparent similarity in the tune as a whole. For instance, Burns' poem Coming Through the Rye is sung to a tune that might also be based on the Miller's Wedding. The origin of the tune of God Save the Queen presents a very similar problem and for just the same reason, as it is also based on a dance measure.[12] (See the note in the William Shield article on this subject.)\\r\\nIn 1855, different words were written for the Auld Lang Syne tune by Albert Laighton and titled, \\"Song of the Old Folks.\\" This song was included in the tunebook, Father Kemp's Old Folks Concert Tunes published in Boston, Massachusetts in 1860.[13] For many years it was the tradition of the Stoughton Musical Society to sing this version in memory of those who had died that year.\\r\\nSongwriter George M. Cohan quotes the first line of the \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" melody in the second to last line of the chorus of You're a Grand Old Flag. It is plain from the lyrics that this is deliberate.\\r\\nJohn Philip Sousa quotes the melody in the Trio section of his 1924 march \\"Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company\\"\\r\\nIn the Sacred Harp choral tradition, an arrangement of it exists under the name \\"Plenary\\". The lyrics are a memento mori and begin with the words \\"Hark! from the tomb a doleful sound\\". Another Christian setting, using the name \\"Fair Haven\\" for the same tune, uses the text \\"Hail! Sweetest, Dearest Tie That Binds\\" by Amos Sutton.[14]\\r\\nThe University of Virginia's alma mater (\\"The Good Old Song\\") is also sung to the tune of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\".\\r\\n\\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is traditionally sung at the conclusion of New Year gatherings in Scotland and around the world, especially in English-speaking countries.\\r\\nAt Hogmanay in Scotland, it is common practice that everyone joins hands with the person next to them to form a great circle around the dance floor. At the beginning of the last verse, everyone crosses their arms across their breast, so that the right hand reaches out to the neighbour on the left and vice versa.[15][16] When the tune ends, everyone rushes to the middle, while still holding hands. When the circle is re-established, everyone turns under the arms to end up facing outwards with hands still joined.\\r\\nIn countries other than Scotland the hands are often crossed from the beginning of the song at variance with Scottish custom. The Scottish practice was demonstrated by the Queen at the Millennium Dome celebrations for the year 2000. The English press berated her for not \\"properly\\" crossing her arms, unaware that she was correctly following the Scottish tradition.[17][18]\\r\\nAs well as celebrating the New Year, \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is very widely used to symbolise other \\"endings/new beginnings\\" ÿ including farewells, funerals (and other memorials of the dead), graduations, the end of a (non-New Year) party or a Scout gathering, the election of a new government, the last lowering of the Union Jack as a British colony achieves independence and even as a signal that a retail store is about to close for the day. The melody is also widely used for other words, especially hymns, the songs of sporting and other clubs, and even national anthems. In Scotland and other parts of Britain, in particular, it is associated with celebrations and memorials of Robert Burns. The following list of specific uses is far from comprehensive.\\r\\n\\"Auld Lang Syne\\" has been translated into many languages, and the song is widely sung all over the world. The song's pentatonic scale matches scales used in Korea, Japan, India, China and other East Asian countries, which has facilitated its \\"nationalisation\\" in the East. The following particular examples mostly detail things that are special or unusual about the use of the song in a particular country.\\r\\nThe strong and obvious associations of the song and its melody have made it a common staple for film soundtracks from the very early days of \\"talking\\" pictures to the presenta large number of films and television series' episodes having used it for background, generally but by no means exclusively to evoke the New Year. Examples can be seen in Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Rob Reiner's When Harry Met Sally (1989).\\r\\nAs a standard in music, Auld Lang Syne has been recorded many times, in every conceivable style, by many artists, both well-known and obscure.","input":"What is the new years eve song called?"},{"output":"the 12th century","context":"The Rialto Bridge (Italian: Ponte di Rialto; Venetian: Ponte de Rialto) is the oldest of the four bridges spanning the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. Connecting the sestieri (districts) of San Marco and San Polo, it has been rebuilt several times since its first construction as a pontoon bridge in the 12th century, and is now a significant tourist attraction in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first dry crossing of the Grand Canal was a pontoon bridge built in 1181 by Nicol Barattieri. It was called the Ponte della Moneta, presumably because of the mint that stood near its eastern entrance.[2]\\r\\nThe development and importance of the Rialto market on the eastern bank increased traffic on the floating bridge, so it was replaced in 1255 by a wooden bridge.[2] This structure had two inclined ramps meeting at a movable central section, that could be raised to allow the passage of tall ships. The connection with the market eventually led to a change of name for the bridge. During the first half of the 15th century, two rows of shops were built along the sides of the bridge. The rents brought an income to the State Treasury, which helped maintain the bridge.\\r\\nMaintenance was vital for the timber bridge. It was partly burnt in the revolt led by Bajamonte Tiepolo in 1310. In 1444, it collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade and it collapsed again in 1524.\\r\\nThe idea of rebuilding the bridge in stone was first proposed in 1503. Several projects were considered over the following decades. In 1551, the authorities requested proposals for the renewal of the Rialto Bridge, among other things. Plans were offered by famous architects, such as Jacopo Sansovino, Palladio and Vignola, but all involved a Classical approach with several arches, which was judged inappropriate to the situation. Michelangelo also was considered as designer of the bridge.\\r\\nThe present stone bridge, a single span designed by Antonio da Ponte, was finally completed in 1591. It is similar to the wooden bridge it succeeded. Two inclined ramps lead up to a central portico. On either side of the portico, the covered ramps carry rows of shops. The engineering of the bridge was considered so audacious that architect Vincenzo Scamozzi predicted future ruin. The bridge has defied its critics to become one of the architectural icons of Venice.\\r\\nToday, the Bridge is one of the top tourism attractions in Venice.[3]\\r\\nIt was called Shylock's bridge in Robert Browning's poem A Toccata of Galuppi's.","input":"When was the rialto bridge in venice built?"},{"output":"November 9, 2007","context":"The history of iPhone began with a request from Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs to the company's engineers, asking them to investigate the use of touchscreen devices and tablet computers (which later came to fruition with the iPad).[1][2][3][4] Many have noted the device's similarities to Apple's previous touch-screen portable device, the Newton MessagePad.[5][6][7][8] Like the Newton, the iPhone is nearly all screen. Its form factor is credited to Apple's Chief Design Officer, Jonathan Ive.[3][9]\\r\\nIn April 2003, at the \\"All Things Digital\\" executive conference, Jobs expressed his belief that tablet PCs and traditional PDAs were not good choices as high-demand markets for Apple to enter, despite receiving many requests for Apple to create another PDA. He believed that cell phones were going to become important devices for portable information access, and that mobile phones needed to have excellent synchronization software. At that time, instead of focusing on a follow-up to their Newton PDA, Jobs had Apple focus on the iPod. Jobs also had Apple develop the iTunes software, which can be used to synchronize content with iPod devices. iTunes was released in January 2001.[10][11][12][13] On September 7, 2005, Apple and Motorola released the ROKR E1, the first mobile phone to use iTunes. Jobs was unhappy with the ROKR, feeling that having to compromise with a non-Apple designer (Motorola) prevented Apple from designing the phone they wanted to make.[14] In September 2006, Apple discontinued support for the ROKR, and released a version of iTunes that included references to an as-yet unknown mobile phone that could display pictures and video.[15] Ed Zander (the CEO of Motorola at the time) \\"inspired\\"[clarify] Steve Jobs with Moto's[clarify] multimedia (e.g., iTunes) + smartphone product concept.[clarify] As a result, Apple gained a new product concept, called \\"iPhone\\", while Motorola walked away[clarify] with a limited version of iTunes for Rokr/Slvr.\\r\\nOn January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs announced iPhone at the Macworld convention, receiving substantial media attention.[16] Jobs announced that the first iPhone would be released later that year. On June 29, 2007, the first iPhone[17] was released.\\r\\nOn June 11, 2007, Apple announced at the Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference that the iPhone would support third-party applications using the Safari engine. Third parties would be able to create Web 2.0 applications, which users could access via the internet.[18] Such applications appeared even before the release of the iPhone; the first of these, called OneTrip, was a program meant to keep track of users' shopping lists.[19] On June 29, 2007, Apple released version 7.3 of iTunes to coincide with the release of iPhone.[20] This release contains support for iPhone service activation and syncing.\\r\\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the iPhone is manufactured on contract[clarify] in the Shenzhen factory of the Taiwanese company Hon Hai (also known as Foxconn).[21] Also, according to recent news, Apple will shortly begin outsourcing the manufacturing of iPhones.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Apple released the iPhone on January 9, 2007,[23] it was sold only with AT&T (formerly Cingular) contracts in the United States.[14] After 18 months of negotiations, Steve Jobs reached an agreement with the wireless division of AT&T to be the iPhone's exclusive carrier. Consumers were unable to use any other carrier without unlocking their device.\\r\\nApple retained control of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the iPhone.[24] Since some customers were jailbreaking their iPhones to leave their network, AT&T began charging them a $175 early-termination fee for leaving before the end of their contract.[25]\\r\\nQuestions arose about the legality of Apple's arrangement after the iPhone was released.[26] Two class-action lawsuits were filed against the company in October 2007: one in Federal court and the other in state court.[27] According to the suits, Apple's exclusive agreement with AT&T violated antitrust law.[28]\\r\\nThe state-court suit, filed by the law office of Damian R. Fernandez on behalf of California resident Timothy P. Smith,[28] sought an injunction barring Apple from selling iPhones with a software lock and $200 million in damages.[29] In Smith v. Apple Inc., the plaintiffs said that Apple failed to disclose to purchasers its five-year agreement with AT&T when they bought iPhones with a two-year contract and cited the Sherman Act's prohibition of monopolies.[30]\\r\\nThe second case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiff, Paul Holman, filed a complaint against Apple and AT&T Mobility that he could not switch carriers or change SIM cards without losing iPhone improvements to which he was entitled. Holman also cited a Sherman Act violation by the defendants.[31] On July?8, 2010, the case was affirmed for class certification.[32] On December 9 the court ordered a stay on the case, awaiting the Supreme Court's decision in AT&T v. Concepcion (disputed whether the state's basic standards of fairness were met by a clause in AT&T's contract limiting complaint resolution to arbitration).[33] On April 27, 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that AT&T met the state's fairness standards.[34]\\r\\nThe first advertisement for iPhone, titled \\"Hello\\", aired during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25, 2007, on American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[35] On June 4, 2007, Apple released four advertisements announcing that iPhone would be released on June 29, 2007.\\r\\nOn July 1, 2007, it was reported that Apple paid at least US$1 million to Michael Kovatch for the iPhone.com domain name, previously owned by Kovatch since 1995.[36] The URL now redirects to Apple's iPhone page.\\r\\nOn June 28, 2007, during an address to Apple employees, Steve Jobs announced that all full-time Apple employees and those part-time employees who had been with the company for at least one year would receive a free iPhone. Employees received their phones in July after the initial demand for iPhones subsided.[37]\\r\\nInitially priced at US $499 and US $599 for the 4GB models and 8GB models respectively, the iPhone went on sale on June 29, 2007. Apple closed its stores at 2:00pm local time to prepare for the 6:00pm iPhone launch, while hundreds of customers lined up at stores nationwide.[38]\\r\\nIn the US and some other countries, iPhones could only be acquired with a credit card, preventing completely anonymous purchases of iPhones.[39][40][41] At the time, there was no way to opt out of the bundled AT&T data plan. At first, iPhones could not be added to an AT&T Business account, and any existing business account discounts could not be applied to an iPhone AT&T account. AT&T changed these restrictions in late January 2008.[42]\\r\\nThe Associated Press also reported in 2007 that some users were unable to activate their phones because, according to AT&T, \\"[a] high volume of activation requests [was] taxing the company's computer servers.\\"[43][44] On Oct 29, 2007, the Usenet newsgroup misc.phone.mobile.iphone was created.[relevant? ÿ discuss]\\r\\nEarly estimates by technology analysts estimated sales of between 250,000 and 700,000 iPhones in the first weekend alone, with strong sales continuing after the initial weekend.[45][46] As part of their quarterly earnings announcement, AT&T reported that 146,000 iPhones were activated in the first weekend. Though this figure does not include units that were purchased for resale on eBay or otherwise not activated until after the opening weekend, it is still less than most initial estimates.[47] It is also estimated that 95% of the units sold are the 8GB model.[48]\\r\\nOn January 11, 2011, Verizon announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone 4. The Verizon iPhone went on sale on February 10, 2011.[49][50][51]\\r\\nDuring Apple's official unveiling of iPhone 4S on October 4, 2011, it was announced that Sprint would begin carrying the reconfigured CDMA iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S in the US on October 14.[52][53] Cricket Wireless announced on May 31, 2012 that it would become the first prepaid carrier in the US to offer iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, beginning June 22, 2012.[54] A week later, Virgin Mobile USA became the second American prepaid carrier to offer iPhone 4 and 4S, announcing plans to release the phones on June 29, 2012.[55] Due to T-Mobile USA's inability to provide iPhone to customers raised its subscription churn rate, put the unit in an \\"unsustainable position\\", and contributed to parent Deutsche Telekom's decision to sell it to AT&T in March 2011;[clarify] T-Mobile began offering iPhone on April 12, 2013.[56]\\r\\nMedia reports emerged in early August 2013 that announced that Apple would be launching its next iPhone model on September 10, 2013, but further details were not available. Brian Barrett, Managing Editor of the Gizmodo publication, speculated that either an upgraded version of iPhone 5 or a budget version would be released.[57]\\r\\nStories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press a little more than a month after iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release.[58] The 300-page iPhone bill in a box received by iJustine on Saturday, August 11, 2007[59][60] became the subject of a viral video, posted by the following Monday, which quickly became an Internet meme.[61][62] This video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media. Ten days later, after the video had been viewed more than 3 million times on the Internet,[63] and had received international news coverage, AT&T sent iPhone users a text message outlining changes in its billing practices.[64]\\r\\nOn September 5, 2007, the 4GB model was discontinued, and the 8GB model price was cut by a third, from US $599 to US $399.[65] Those who had purchased an iPhone in the 14-day period before the September 5, 2007 announcement were eligible for a US $200 \\"price protection\\" rebate from Apple or AT&T. However, it was widely reported that some who bought between the June 29, 2007 launch and the August 22, 2007 price protection kick-in date complained that this was a larger-than-normal price drop for such a relatively short period and accused Apple of unfair pricing.[66][67]\\r\\nIn response to customer complaints, on September 6, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs wrote in an open letter to iPhone customers that everyone who purchased an iPhone at the higher price \\"and who is not receiving a rebate or other consideration\\", would receive a US$100 credit to be redeemed towards the purchase of any product sold in Apple's retail or online stores.[68]\\r\\nWith the July 11, 2008 release of the iPhone 3G, Apple and AT&T changed the US pricing model from the previous generation. Following the de facto model for mobile phone service in the United States, AT&T would subsidize a sizable portion of the upfront cost for the iPhone 3G, followed by charging moderately higher monthly fees over a minimum two-year contract.[69]\\r\\nOn November 9, 2007, the iPhone was officially launched in Europe, in the United Kingdom and Germany.[clarify] In the UK, sales go through the UK O2 unit of Telef܇nica, while in Germany, it is offered through Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile division.[clarify] As in the case of the previous launch in the US, customers lined up as much as a day in advance to obtain the much-anticipated phone.[70]\\r\\nApple occasionally produced a limited number of 4GB iPhones for German and UK markets, but they never reached end customers and were used as in-store demo units. Later[when?] most of the units were disposed of.[71]\\r\\nThe initial operating model of locking iPhone owners to one selected carrier has been controversial in Europe. In Germany, Vodafone, an operator competing with the operator that Apple had locked German iPhone sales to (Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile division), brought a legal case[clarify] claiming that the arrangement was against German law. On November 20, 2007, an interim court order resulted in sales of locked iPhones in Germany being temporarily stopped. The iPhone launch in France a few weeks later through the operator Orange faced the same legal issues. Other countries that will pose[clarify] the same problems for the business model revolving around the sale of locked iPhones include Belgium, Italy, Finland, and Brazil.\\r\\nOn December 1, 2007, Tu?mobil, the Slovenian mobile operator,[clarify] started selling \\"unlocked\\" iPhones without an official contract with Apple. The offer caused confusion between Apple Europe, local media, and local Apple representatives.[72]\\r\\nOn May 6, 2008, Telecom Italia announced that it had signed a deal with Apple to sell iPhones in Italy by the end of 2008.[73] It was estimated that it would probably be the second generation iPhone with 3G-UMTS capability.\\r\\nOn May 27, 2008, TeliaSonera released a press release stating that it would start selling iPhones in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia during 2008.[74]\\r\\nOn June 4, 2008, Movistar announced that it had signed a deal with Apple to sell iPhones in Spain beginning on July 11, 2008.[75]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2008, Estonian mobile operator EMT started selling iPhones.[76]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2008, Vodafone Greece released iPhones in the Greek market.[77]\\r\\nOn September 26, 2008, Omnitel released iPhones in Lithuania.[78]\\r\\nOn November 7, 2008, T-Mobile released iPhones in Croatia.[79]\\r\\nOn September 29, 2010, Elisa released the iPhone 4 in Finland.[80]\\r\\nSingTel (in Singapore) and Globe Telecom (in the Philippines) were the first two carriers to launch the iPhone in Southeast Asia. Both carriers launched the iPhone 3G in August 2008.\\r\\nOn March 20, 2009, Telkomsel became the first telecommunications company in Indonesia to offer the iPhone 3G with customizable plans for all Telkomsel customers.[clarify][81] In the same month, Maxis of Malaysia and DiGi both launched the iPhone 3G.[where?]\\r\\nOn October 2011, StarHub launched the iPhone in Singapore. Smart Communications followed suit in December 2011 by launching the iPhone 4S in the Philippines.

The original models available for sale in New Zealand were unlocked for use on the Vodafone network and could be used with any plan, including pre-paid plans.[86]\\r\\nSubsequent launches of iPhone models in New Zealand have typically been a few weeks after the worldwide release.\\r\\nOn November 8, 2011, Telecom announced that they would offer the iPhone 4S on their network, along with earlier models (the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4).[87]\\r\\nAfter months of high anticipation, the first iPhone to be released in Canada was the iPhone 3G. Rogers Wireless began offering 8 GB and 16 GB models on July 11, 2008. Facing a public backlash,[88] Rogers dropped the price of its service plan from CA$100 to CA$30 per month.[89]\\r\\nThe iPhone 3GS, with the new iOS 3.0 operating system, was released in Canada by Rogers Wireless on June 19, 2009.

On July 3, 2007, Jon Lech Johansen reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked iPhone's other features with jailbreaking. He published the software and offsets for others to use.[117]\\r\\nOn August 14, 2007, Gizmodo reported verification of a method to bypass iPhone's SIM lock, allowing the phone to work freely with carriers other than AT&T. This method requires usage of a Turbo SIM card, costing approximately US$80; the method essentially tricks iPhone into believing that it is operating on the AT&T network, even when it is connected natively (not in roaming mode) to another carrier.[118] Australian Personal Computer later published a ten-step guide to unlocking iPhone, using the Turbo SIM method.[119]\\r\\nIn mid-August, UniquePhones announced an unlocking service for iPhone, only to retract the service the following week after receiving a phone call from a lawyer representing AT&T.\\r\\nOn August 24, 2007, George Hotz, a 17-year-old hacker from Glen Rock, New Jersey, broke the lock that ties iPhone to AT&T's wireless network. He confirmed that he unlocked the phone and was using it on T-Mobile's network. The hack opened up a realm of possibilities for overseas customers because iPhone was only sold in the United States at the time. By unlocking it, Hotz opened up the phone to phone networks across the world. Hotz posted the hack on his blog. The process is complicated and requires both disassembling iPhone and executing software commands on a personal computer. Hotz, along with four others across the world, reportedly spent about 500 hours unlocking the phone.[120][121]\\r\\nAlso on August 24, 2007, Engadget reported, by way of photos and a video clip, that they were called by the \\"iPhoneSimFree\\" team, who offered to show Engadget a demonstration of unlocking iPhone using a software-only method.[122] Unlike Hotz's hardware hack, the code in this hack was not made available to the general public. Sales of the unlock started on September 10. These sales occurred through several resellers who were able to order \\"keys\\" from iPhoneSimFree, then pass the \\"keys\\" to customers, allowing the customers to use the software.\\r\\nOn September 11, after one day of sales, the iPhone Dev Team announced that they had created a working \\"software unlock\\", and released it to the public for free.[123] Utilizing the existing unlock[clarify] requires some technical knowledge, although a simpler, GUI-based version was under construction.

Created by  John Masius and produced by Martha Williamson, the series stars Roma Downey, as an angel named Monica, and Della Reese, as her supervisor Tess. Throughout the series, Monica is tasked with bringing guidance and messages from God to various people who are at a crossroads in their lives. From Season Three onward, they are frequently joined by Andrew (John Dye), the angel of death (who first appeared as a recurring character in season two). The series went into syndication in 1998, and has been shown on Ion Television (formerly PAX-TV), Hallmark Channel, CBS Drama, Up, Disney Channel UK and Me-TV.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe episodes of the series generally revolved around the \\"cases\\" of Monica (played by Roma Downey), a young angel recently promoted from the \\"search and rescue\\" division, who works under the guidance of Tess (played by Della Reese), a sarcastic boss who showed greater respect as an authority figure of her employee, and is more of a surrogate mother, than a mentor. Monica in one episode outlines that she started in the choir then annunciations, followed by search and rescue and then case work. Most cases involve a single person or a group of people who are at a crossroad in their lives and facing a large problem or tough decision. Monica and Tess bring them messages of hope from God and help give them guidance towards making their decision. During their first episode, the pair receive a red 1972 Cadillac Eldorado convertible as a gift; they use it for transportation throughout the rest of the series while in the human world, with Tess doing the driving. As the series progresses, Monica continues gaining experience as a case worker and, during some cases having to learn lessons of her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the series pilot, an angel of death named Adam is introduced. In the season two premiere, \\"Interview with an Angel\\", the Angel of Death is introduced as Henry. In the season two episode entitled, \\"The One That Got Away\\" Andrew (played by John Dye) is introduced as the Angel of Death. (Initially a recurring character, he becomes a main character in season three, making him the permanent Angel of Death for the remainder of the series.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring season seven, a new angel, Gloria, is sent by God during one of Monica's assignments, who becomes a regular character for seasons eight and nine, as a trainee under Monica and Tess's guidance.\\r\\nIn the series finale, Monica is up for promotion to supervisor, pending the outcome of a difficult case in which she must defend Zack (Scott Bairstow), an innocent drifter accused of causing a boiler explosion at a school two years ago in the small town of Ascension, Colorado. The explosion killed most of the children, leaving the citizens devastated. During the case, Monica sees many familiar faces, including Joey Machulis (Paul Wittenburg), one of Monica's previous assignments who is a witness to the events, his brother Wayne (Randy Travis), who is now sheriff, Sophie (Marion Ross), a formerly homeless acquaintance, and Mike (Patrick Duffy), a lawyer Monica saved during her search and rescue days who is now the Mayor. An out of town developer claims Zack is the perpetrator and despite the lack of evidence, Zack is put on trial. Monica does all she can to help him, including asking Mike to represent him, but the prosecutor in the case, Jones, is really Satan in disguise, and Zack is eventually convicted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the trial, Monica is able to help the citizens realize their mistake and to see that Zack's return to the town had helped them finally start living again. They begin going back to church, welcomed by the pastor they had once abandoned. Their change of heart, however, cannot free Zack, so Monica visits him in jail and reveals that she is an angel. She then promises him that she will become his guardian angel, forgoing all future assignments and the coveted promotion, to protect him from harm in prison. When she returns in the morning, however, the cell is empty. The citizens decide not to search for him, and it is revealed that Joey inadvertently caused the explosion after the devil tricked him into turning the boiler too high to warm some kittens he'd found.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe perplexed Monica returns to the desert to find Tess and Zack. There, she learns that Zack was actually Jesus, and that her defending him was a test, which she passed by being willing to sacrifice herself for him. Monica is promoted to supervisor. As she leaves, she says her goodbyes to Gloria, and to Andrew, who gives her a pocket watch to remember their friendship by. Before parting, Tess gives Monica the keys to the Cadillac, as she is leaving her job to sit at God's feet. Monica is last shown driving away as the camera pans out over the desert.\\r\\n\\r\\nTouched by an Angel was produced by CBS and Moon Water Productions.[3] Most episodes of the series were produced in Salt Lake City, Utah.  According to New York Times reviewer Caryn James, John Masius created the first pilot episode for the series, but it was a darker, less hopeful story than the producers wanted.[4] [5] It cost the studio $2 million to produce the episode. Masius wrote the show as a reflection of his spiritual anger at the time at his two children being born disabled.[6] Martha Williamson was approached to be the series executive producer in early 1994. She described the pilot she received as \\"upsetting\\" as it \\"portrayed angels as recycled dead people with power over life and death\\". She initially declined the position, but during a lunch with Andy Hill, then President of CBS, she mentioned the show and suggested he find a producer who would create a show with \\"loving, joyful\\" angels that the audience would have to believe in.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliamson stated that she could not stop thinking about the show after that meeting, and eventually called to ask if the position was still open. Though getting the position was no longer a sure thing, she passed up a more lucrative position directing a court drama and went in for an interview with CBS in June 1994. During her interview, she states she emphasized that she was a Christian and could only do a show that depicted angels in a way she felt was true to her view of angels and that was respectful towards God. She also indicated that the pilot should be redone from the beginning, keeping only the characters Monica and Tess, reworked. The studio agreed with her remarks and hired her.[7] Williamson herself wrote a new script for the pilot episode, while also working on hiring the remaining staff for the series, which was due to premiere in September. The pilot was filmed in Salt Lake City, Utah and the show was ready on schedule. The first episode aired on September 14, 1994.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lyrics to the show's theme song, \\"Walk With You\\", are sung at the beginning of each episode by Della Reese.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, Promised Land was launched as a spin-off series, following the Greene family whom Monica had met during one of her cases, as they travel the United States helping those in need. Four crossover episodes aired during Promised Land's three-season run.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was nominated for eleven Primetime Emmy Awards between 1997 and 2000, including two nominations each for Downey and Reese in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series categories, respectively.[8][9] It was also nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, two in 1998 and 1999 for Downey for Best Performance by an Actress in a TV-Series - Drama, and one in 1998 for Reese for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series [10][11] even though the series was never able to secure either award. Marc Lichtman was awarded five BMI Film and Television Awards for \\"Television Music\\" in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 for his work as the series composer.[12][13][14][15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1999 variation of the \\"Madalyn Murray O'Hair petition\\" urban legend, which claims to seek a ban on religious programming, mentioned the show and appeared via e-mail chains despite O'Hair being deceased since 1995 and her original actual religious programming petition to the FCC being rejected in 1975.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nTouched by an Angel received mixed reviews from critics but positive reception from audiences. During the show's first season, the show was criticized by some people calling it \\"syrupy\\"[18] [19] (earlier reviews were skeptical of the show's first season). [20] Common Sense Media reviewer Emily Ashby gave the show 3 out of 5 stars, who said that \\"this uplifting, inspirational show is steeped in strong moral messages, life lessons, and Christian overtones that include multiple references to \\"God,\\" \\"Lord,\\" and the \\"Father.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Parents Television Council picked it as one of the best shows for family viewing.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaria Bamford imitated Monica on the track \\"Touched By an Angel\\" on her Burning Tours album.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was also spoofed on MadTV as \\"Touched By an Atheist\\" guest starring comedian George Carlin.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nMerle Highchurch, a character on the podcast The Adventure Zone, frequently summons Della Reese or Roma Downey as part of his Guardian of Faith spell.\\r\\n\\r\\nTouched by an Angel became one of CBS's highest-rated series during season three and continued through season six, when it was the ninth most watched network series, with 17,190,000 viewers that amounted to a 15% share of the market as determined by Nielsen Media Research.[25] In season eight, after the series moved from its Sunday time slot to a Saturday one, it dropped to 79th place, with 8.3 million viewers.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nA book on the series, Touched by an Angel, was published by Zondervan in November 1997. Written by Williams and Robin Sheets, it contains background information on some of the stories featured, series production information, basic details on the first fifty episodes and profiles of Downey, Reese and Dye. It also has short story versions of four episodes: \\"Interview with an Angel\\", \\"There, but for the Grace of God\\", \\"An Unexpected Snow\\" and \\"Jacob's Ladder\\".[34] A second book, In the Words of Angels: Twenty Inspiring Stories from Touched By an Angel, was published by Fireside Books on August 28, 2001. Also written by Williams, it collects twenty short stories based on episodes from the series.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn audio soundtrack, Touched by an Angel: The Album, was released on November 3, 1998. The 15-track CD includes a full-length version of the series theme song, \\"Walk With You\\", performed by Della Reese and songs by Cline Dion, Shawn Colvin, Bob Dylan, Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Amy Grant, Jaci Velasquez, The Kinleys, Wynonna and Amanda Marshall.[36] The soundtrack went platinum.[citation needed] A second album, Touched by an Angel: Christmas Album, was released on November 9, 1999 with 13 tracks of Christmas music. In addition to having tracks performed by Reese and Romey, it features songs from Randy Travis, Keb' Mo', Charlotte Church, Kirk Franklin, Collin Raye, Amy Grant and Donna Summer.[37] Both albums were released by Sony Music Entertainment, the successor to the former record division of CBS.\\r\\n\\r\\nCBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released all nine seasons on DVD in Region 1.

In addition to being a major tourist attraction for Vancouver, the aquarium is a centre for marine research, conservation and marine animal rehabilitation.\\r\\nThe Vancouver Aquarium was one of the first facilities to incorporate professional naturalists into the galleries to interpret animal behaviours.[7] Prior to this, at the London Zoo Fish House, naturalists James S. Bowerbank, Ray Lankester, David W. Mitchell and Philip H. Gosse (the creator of the word aquarium)[8] had regularly held \\"open house\\" events, but the Vancouver Aquarium was the first to employ educational naturalists on a full-time basis. Aquarium research projects extend worldwide, and include marine mammal rescue and rehabilitation.\\r\\nOn August 9, 2010 Prime Minister Stephen Harper and B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell announced capital funding of up to $15 million. The province would donate $10 million in funding over the next three years to help pay for a planned expansion of the 54-year-old facility, Premier Gordon Campbell said. Harper added that Ottawa would hand over up to $5 million to the aquarium for infrastructure upgrades.[9] The aquarium, however, remains a nonprofit organization. The property is owned by the City of Vancouver and rented to the Aquarium for $40,000 a year since 1991 (prior to which it was $1 per year).\\r\\nIn October 2009 the Vancouver Aquarium was designated as a Coastal America Learning Center by the US Environmental Protection Agency. As the first Learning Center in Canada, this designation is intended to strengthen the Canadian/U.S. partnership for protecting and restoring shared ocean resources.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vancouver Public Aquarium Association was formed in 1950 by UBC fisheries and oceanography professors Murray Newman, Carl Lietze and Wilbert Clemens. After receiving the help of timber baron H.R. MacMillan, alderman and businessman George Cunningham and $100,000 from each of the three levels of government. (City of Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, Federal Government of Canada), it opened on June 15, 1956 with the ribbon being cut by federal Minister of Fisheries James Sinclair. Sinclair's daughter 7-year-old Margaret was also present at the ribbon cutting ceremony (she would later marry Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and give birth to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau).\\r\\nOfficially Canada's first public Aquarium, the Vancouver Aquarium has become the largest in Canada and one of the five largest in North America. The Vancouver Aquarium was the first aquarium in the world to capture and display an orca. Other whales and dolphins on display included belugas, narwhals[11] and dolphins.\\r\\nIn 1975, the Vancouver Aquarium was the first aquarium accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The Aquarium is also accredited by the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) and in 1987 was designated Canada's Pacific National Aquarium by the Canadian Federal Government.\\r\\nOn July 23, 1995, a beluga whale named Qila was born. She was the first beluga to be both conceived and born in a Canadian aquarium. A second calf, Tuvaq, was born on July 30, 2002, but died unexpectedly with no previous sign of illness on July 17, 2005.\\r\\nIn 1996, the Vancouver Park Board instituted a municipal bylaw that prevents the Vancouver Aquarium from capturing cetaceans from the wild for display purposes, and only obtain cetaceans from other facilities if they were born in captivity, captured before 1996 or were rescued and deemed un-releasable after this date.\\r\\nOn June 15, 2006 Canada Post issued a 51 cent domestic rate stamp to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Aquarium.\\r\\nFor many years, the primary attraction for visitors was the orca show. The Aquarium was the first to capture and display a killer whale, Moby Doll, in a pen at Burrard Drydocks, for 3 months in 1964. Since then, it was home to Skana, Hyak II, Finna, Bjossa, and three of Bjossa's calves. When Finna died and Bjossa was left without other orca companions, the Aquarium attempted to acquire one or more female orcas from other marine parks. However, no suitable companions were found, and Bjossa was moved to SeaWorld, San Diego, in April 2001 where she later died due to a chronic respiratory illness. The Aquarium has since moved to emphasize the educational aspects of the displays rather than the public spectacle of the shows. They have also highlighted their research, rescue and rehabilitation efforts.\\r\\nThe aquarium has played a significant role in the research of wild orcas in BC. John Ford, a respected researcher who focuses on orca vocalizations, worked there for many years and they still fund a lot of the study. The Wild Killer Whale Adoption Program, which funds research, is also run out of the aquarium.\\r\\nAfter considerable public discussion and some opposition from an animal rights group, the Vancouver Park Board voted in favour of a proposal to expand the Aquarium at a cost of $100 million, funded by the Aquarium, private donors, and infrastructure grants. A public consultation process, led by the aquarium and their own consultants, showed 89% of local residents were in favour of the expansion. The proposal will increase the size of the Aquarium by 1.5 acres (6,100?m2) and extend its lease by 20 years. Construction was expected to begin in the fall of 2007.[12]\\r\\nVancouver Aquarium has not kept any orcas in captivity since 2001 and has pledged not to capture wild animals, but to instead rely on captive animals for breeding.[13]\\r\\nThe aquarium covers approximately 9,000 square metres (97,000?sq?ft) and has a total 9,500,000 litres (2,100,000?imp?gal; 2,500,000?US?gal) of water in 166 aquatic displays.[citation needed] There are a number of different galleries, several of which were built at different times throughout the aquarium's history.\\r\\nThis central indoor exhibit consists of a 260,000 litres (57,000?imp?gal; 69,000?US?gal) tank directly adjacent to the entrance. Fish and invertebrates from the Strait of Georgia are displayed in the exhibit.\\r\\nOriginally this gallery included the Beluga whales along with several non-living displays. In October 2009, a new exhibit opened here[14] displaying several other arctic species, including fishes and invertebrates, along with expanded non-living exhibits as part of the Canada's Arctic Gallery. In 2016, the 2 rescued Harbour Porpoises from the BC Sugar Pool next door, moved to the Canada's Arctic Gallery. Following the deaths of two belugas in 2016, it has been converted into an active Steller Sea Lion research station called Steller's Bay in collaboration with the University of British Columbia. The exhibit reopened as Steller's Bay on July 1st, 2017. It is home to a four female steller sea lions.\\r\\nInspired by Boulders Beach, this exhibit features African penguins bred by the Species Survival Plan.\\r\\nThis is an outdoor gallery that includes several pools, home to Pacific white-sided dolphins, sea otters, and harbour porpoises that are permanently on display here, along with a \\"touchpool\\" where visitors are able to touch British Columbian invertebrates. Several other species (harbour seals, Steller's sea lions, and northern fur seals) are rotated in to display in this area. When not on display they live in habitats behind the scenes that are not accessible to visitors.\\r\\nThis gallery is a series of separate exhibits that simulate the various aquatic environments on the BC coast. Octopuses, Rockfish, sea stars, sea urchins, and anemones are among the animals here.\\r\\nThis gallery contains a large display of tropical fish and other animals, including blacktip reef sharks and a green sea turtle named Schoona.\\r\\nA number of fresh water fish, snakes, caimans, sloths, birds, and other creatures from the Amazon inhabit this gallery.\\r\\nThis gallery is an exhibit focused on the plight of the world's frog population which endeavors to show how people can help protect frogs and other amphibians. It contains 26 species of amphibians from around the world.[15]\\r\\nThis gallery is home to jellies, fish, and other animals. The 4D Theatre and the children's play area known as \\"Clownfish Cove\\" are here, along with multiple classrooms for school groups, including the wet lab education room, which contains both conventional teaching methods such as computers, tables, and chairs, along with live animals and various artifacts.\\r\\nThe Vancouver Aquarium currently houses around 300 species of fish, almost 30,000 invertebrates, and 56 species of amphibians and reptiles. They also have around 60 mammals and birds.\\r\\nCurrently, the Aquarium houses one Pacific white-sided dolphin:\\r\\nPast Pacific White-Sided Dolphins:\\r\\nThe aquarium used to house a False Killer Whale:\\r\\nThe Aquarium also housed two beluga whales. Qila was born in captivity, whereas Aurora was captured from the wild in waters near Churchill, Manitoba in 1990.[21]\\r\\nBoth belugas lived in the Canada's Arctic enclosure (Now Steller's Bay).\\r\\nOn breeding loan to SeaWorld, Shedd Aquarium & Georgia Aquarium are the following:\\r\\nPast Belugas:\\r\\nThe Vancouver Aquarium used to house two Pacific harbour porpoise rescued by the Aquarium's Marine Mammal Rescue Centre. Daisy was rescued from Gonzolez Beach, B.C. in 2008, and after receiving almost a year of veterinary care and being deemed nonreleasable, was transferred to the Vancouver Aquarium on July 29, 2009. Daisy died on June 16, 2017 [23][24] Another Pacific harbour porpoise, Jack, was rescued from Horseshoe Bay, B.C. in September 2011 and transferred to the Aquarium on March 15, 2012. Jack died in August 2016.\\r\\nThe Aquarium is home to six sea otters:\\r\\nPast Otters:\\r\\nThe Aquarium is also home to two harbor seals at this time, all of which are male (DaVinci, and Hermes).\\r\\nThe Aquarium also houses 6 northern fur seals (Meechi, Tikva, Tuku, Kyoo, Aya, and Ani), and four female Steller sea lions (Willo, Ashby, Rogue, and Izzy). The sea lions actually belong to the University of British Columbia, and are part of a research program aimed at studying the causes for the collapse of the Steller sea lion population in Alaska.\\r\\nAt an off-site research facility, an additional 4 Steller sea lions are kept as part of an open-water research program. They are Hazy, Sitka, Boni, and Yasha.\\r\\nOn July 1, 2008, Tag, a 15-year-old male sea lion, died due to oral cancer, despite receiving laser surgery and chemotherapy.[16] Tag was a 15-year-old male sea lion who arrived at the Aquarium as a 2-week-old pup.[16]\\r\\nThe Aquarium has one green sea turtle (Schoona). Schoona is a 16-year-old sea turtle, who has arrived at the aquarium in 2005.\\r\\nGiselle is a zebra shark who arrived at the Vancouver Aquarium around 2008. Giselle is around 15 years old.\\r\\nThe Vancouver Aquarium has created and operates a number of conservation and research programs aimed at understanding and preserving animal species in the wild.\\r\\nThe Vancouver Aquarium has a program called Ocean Wise, which is aimed at promoting sustainable seafood in restaurants, markets, and other food service facilities. Its main thrust is to avoid species whose fishing typically causes large bycatches, species from areas where the habitat will degrade if overfished, and species which themselves are overfished.[30] Ocean Wise works directly with food service companies to select sustainable seafood and actively promote them to the general public. The options are highlighted on participating restaurant menus and display cases with the Ocean Wise symbol, to help consumers make environmentally friendly seafood choices. Today, well over 300 restaurants in Canada are participants in the Ocean Wise program.[31]\\r\\nThe Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup is a program that was initiated by the Vancouver Aquarium by a small group of staff members and volunteers in 1994. These employees had heard about the International Coastal Cleanup and decided to participate in it by picking up garbage at a local beach and submitting the information.[32] The Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup is an annual international initiative aimed to engage people to remove trash and debris from the world's beaches and waterways, identify the sources of debris, and change the behaviors that cause marine debris in the first place.\\r\\nVolunteers and sponsors collect and catalogue debris which is then collected for analysis on sources of garbage that enter the ocean.[33] For example, in 2007, 1,240 beach sites with a collective length of 1,772?km were cleaned by 52,263 volunteers bringing in almost 87.5 metric tons of garbage.[34]\\r\\nThe Vancouver Aquarium operates a Marine Mammal Rescue program which is aimed at rescuing and rehabilitating marine mammals that are found injured, ill, or abandoned, until they can be re-released into their natural habitats. On average, the Rescue Centre admits approximately 100 distressed marine mammals per year.[35] The vast majority of these are harbour seals, but patients can include sea otters, elephant seals, Steller sea lions, harbour porpoises, and common dolphins.[36][37] The program notably helped rescue Springer, an orphaned killer whale successfully released and reunited with her family pod.[38] Other high-profile rescues include the successful returning of a beached gray whale back to the water in 2005 and the rescue of Schoona, a lost green sea turtle near Prince Rupert, BC. In October 2013, rescued harbour porpoise Levi became the first cetacean to be rehabilitated at the Marine Marine Mammal Rescue Centre and released back into the wild.[39]\\r\\nThe B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network is a collaborative conservation and research program between the Vancouver Aquarium and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada aimed at collecting reports and sightings of whales and sea turtles in the wild. The Sightings Network is a network of over 1,800 observers across British Columbia, including whale watching operators, lighthouse keepers, charter boat operators, tugboat captains, BC Ferries personnel, researchers, government employees, recreational boaters and coastal residents. The program aims to solicit reports through the program's website, a toll-free hotline, email, or through the logbook program.[40]\\r\\nIn 2014, the Vancouver Aquarium's practice of keeping whales, dolphins and porpoises in captivity and its beluga whale breeding program sparked controversy.\\r\\nIn March 2014, two Park Board Commissioners, Sarah Blyth and Constance Barnes, publicly spoke out against the practice of keeping whales and dolphins in captivity at the aquarium.[41][42] Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, in an emailed letter to The Georgia Straight, expressed his personal belief that \\"the Vancouver Aquarium should begin to phase out the holding of whales and dolphins in captivity\\".[43] Primatologist and ethologist Jane Goodall called for the Park Board to follow through with the proposed \\"phase out\\" of cetaceans and end the Vancouver Aquarium's captive breeding program.[44][45]\\r\\nThe Vancouver Aquarium responded to criticism with an open letter[46] in which they explained that it was their policy not to capture cetaceans from the wild and that the aquarium played a role as a home for rescued cetaceans that cannot be returned to the wild.\\r\\nThe Park Board proceeded to commission an independent report from US wildlife veterinarian and scientist Dr. Joseph Gaydos[47] in which he examined the aquarium's animal care standards, accreditation and research and compared it to similar facilities in North America. In his report[48] he found that the Vancouver Aquarium \\"either meets or exceeds North American industry standards\\". He also concluded that the aquarium had \\"an active research department that seems to make good use of studying captive cetaceans, not only for being able to provide better care and understanding of captive animals, but to a greater extent [...] to benefit our understanding and conservation of cetaceans in the wild.\\" Dr Gaydos also made two recommendations. He recommended that the Park Board conduct \\"a large-scale scientific study on the welfare of captive housed cetaceans\\" as a way of assessing \\"the complex societal issue of captive cetaceans\\". He also suggested that the Park Board require the aquarium to release an annual report on the state of its cetaceans.\\r\\nIn the media, the Gaydos report was widely received as a positive review of the aquarium's practices[49][50] and the Vancouver Aquarium also received support from prominent philanthropists and politicians, as well as four former Vancouver mayors.[51][52] The Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California also spoke out in favour of the Vancouver Aquarium's cetacean program, citing its importance for scientific research.[53]\\r\\nAfter a long public debate that ended with the presentation of the Gaydos report and two days of public hearings,[54] the Vancouver Park Board announced in August 2014 that it intended to enact a by-law to ban breeding of cetaceans at the Vancouver Aquarium, and it tasked its staff with drafting an amendment to the existing by-law regulating cetaceans at the aquarium.[55] Vancouver Aquarium CEO Dr. John Nightingale criticized the decision in a public letter, stating that the decision \\"was not based on the facts or science presented\\" and that it did not take into consideration \\"testimony from dozens of the worlds scientific community, including experts in animal welfare and animal cognition.\\".[56]\\r\\nFollowing a defeat in the elections to Park Board as part of the 2014 civic elections, a majority of the Park Board commissioners, in their last session, voted against enacting an amendment to the by-law.[57]\\r\\nThe Vancouver Aquarium was featured frequently in the 1980s Canadian series, Danger Bay, which followed the day to day exploits of the Roberts family, led by Grant \\"Doc\\" Roberts, a marine veterinarian and his two children, Nicole and Jonah.\\r\\nA YouTube video featuring two sea otters \\"holding hands\\" was recorded at the Vancouver Aquarium.[58] The two sea otters are Nyac and Milo. Nyac died on September 23, 2008.[59] She was one of the last surviving sea otters of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.[60] The video has been viewed over 19 million times on YouTube. As a result, the Vancouver Aquarium created a live sea otter cam on their website. The YouTube video was originally recorded by Cynthia Holmes.[61] Milo died on January 12, 2012.[62]\\r\\nThe Vancouver Aquarium was also featured in the family film Andre (1994), and romantic comedy Good Luck Chuck (2007), as Cam's workplace. Television movie The Suite Life Movie (2011) used the Aquarium as the research firm where Cody Martin interns.\\r\\nOn September 5, 2008, Hayden Panettiere appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and talked about her visit with the rescue dolphins at the Vancouver Aquarium.\\r\\nThe song \\"Baby Beluga\\" by Raffi was inspired by Kavna, a beluga that he saw while visiting the Vancouver Aquarium.\\r\\n Media related to Vancouver Aquarium at Wikimedia Commons","input":"When did vancouver aquarium get rid of orcas?"},{"output":"10 to 14 days","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLand's End to John o' Groats is the traversal of the whole length of the island of Great Britain between two extremities; in the southwest and northeast.  The traditional distance by road is 874 miles (1,407?km) and takes most cyclists 10 to 14 days; the record for running the route is nine days. Off-road walkers typically walk about 1,200 miles (1,900?km) and take two or three months for the expedition.  Two much-photographed signposts indicate the traditional distance at each end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe straight-line distance from Land's End to John o' Groats is 603 miles (970?km) as determined from O.S.

Google Earth reports a distance of 602.70 miles between the two iconic marker points.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 1964 road atlas, the shortest route using classified roads was 847 miles (1,363?km) but in a 2008 road atlas, the shortest route using classified roads was 838 miles (1,349?km). An online route planner in 2011 also calculated the quickest route by road as 838 miles (1,349?km), estimating a time of 15 hours 48 minutes for the journey (this uses the A30, M5, M6, A74(M), M74, M73, M80, M9, A9 & A99) but the overall shortest route by road, using minor roads in numerous places and utilising modern bridges, is only about 814 miles (1,310?km).  This route is roughly as follows: Land's End, Bodmin, Okehampton, Tiverton, Taunton, Bridgwater, the M5 Avon Bridge, the M48 Severn Bridge, Monmouth, Hereford, Shrewsbury, Tarporley, St Helens, Preston, Carlisle, Beattock, Carstairs, Whitburn, Falkirk, Stirling, Crieff, Kenmore, Dalchalloch, A9, Inverness, Kessock Bridge, Cromarty Bridge, Dornoch Firth Bridge, Latheron, Wick, John o' Groats.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle Maps, on 2 August 2017, calculated the fastest route by car, from the Land's End Visitor Centre to John o' Groats as being 837 miles and taking 14 hours 40 minutes.

Traditionally considered to be a walk, the route is now traversed in a number of ways, with cycling and multi-modal expeditions being particularly popular in recent years.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost trips are done by individuals or small groups for personal fulfilment. Some expeditions are organised as charity fundraisers, sometimes involving celebrities: examples include cricketer Ian Botham's 1985 walk and athlete Jane Tomlinson in 2003. In recent history the route has been used as a rite of passage by cyclists taking on the most iconic cycling challenge in Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded end-to-end walk (actually from John o' Groats to Land's End) was undertaken by the brothers John and Robert Naylor in 1871.[1]  Since then the walk has been undertaken many times, more particularly since 1960, after a well-publicised road walk by Dr Barbara Moore.  In 1960 the entrepreneur Billy Butlin organised a road walking race, which gave further impetus to the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1960s, walkers have mostly chosen off-road routes, using the growing network of long-distance footpaths.  A classic account is from 1966 by the travel writer John Hillaby.[2] Off-road walkers usually complete the journey in two to three months. There is a considerable choice of off-road routes, but all are much longer than the shortest road distance, usually 1,200 miles (1,900?km) or more.  The walk is still undertaken by road walkers, often doing the walk, like Sir Ian Botham, for charity, or as a \\"challenge walk\\".  They typically take a month or even less.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome walkers aim to complete the route piecemeal, perhaps over several years, to achieve the walk within the time constraints of a working life and before the possible health problems of retirement.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no continuous long-distance path from Land's End to John o' Groats.  There are long-distance paths for substantial sections of the route, and where they do not exist walkers connect them by rights of way and minor roads. Most walkers broadly follow these routes:[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several annual mass participation cycle rides that go from Land's End to John o' Groats, the biggest of which is the Deloitte Ride Across Britain,[5] run by Threshold Sports. The Ride Across Britain takes over 800 riders the full length of Britain, taking nine days and covering 969 miles (1,559?km), with each rider covering an average of 107 miles (172?km) per day. Overnight accommodation is provided in large, tented base camps, and all aspects of the ride are fully supported. Previous celebrity participants include GB rower and Olympic gold medallist James Cracknell and former England Rugby captain Lewis Moody.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official Road Records Association record for a rider on a conventional bicycle is 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds, set by 40 year old Michael Broadwith on 17 June 2018.[6] Michael is a maths teacher who lives in the south of England. He studied mathematics at St Edmund Hall, Oxford University, representing the university in the reserves boat race in 2000. He won the UK national 24 hour cycling road race (Mersey roads) in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the lead up to his record breaking ride. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe record for cycling from Land's End to John o' Groats is held by Andy Wilkinson, who completed the journey in 41 hours, 4 minutes and 22 seconds on a Windcheetah recumbent tricycle.[7] A typical cycling time when not attempting shortest time is 10 to 14 days. James MacDonald set a record in September 2017 for cycling from John o' Groats to Land's End and back again in five days, 18 hours and 3 minutes.[8] From 1 to 4 March 2010, David Walliams, Jimmy Carr, Fearne Cotton, Miranda Hart, Patrick Kielty, Davina McCall and Russell Howard cycled in a team relay from John o' Groats to Land's End to raise money for Sport Relief.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nMen's tandem bicycle. 5ÿ7 May 2015 Riders: Dominic Irvine and Charlie Mitchell. Time: 1 day 21 hours 11 minutes.[10] The previous record held for 49 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first tricyclist to complete the route was Mr. Alfred Nixon, champion of the London Tricycle Club, who in 1882 made the first, and at present only, tricycle journey from John o Groats to Lands End, a distance of 1007 miles, in a fortnight.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nMen's quadricycle. In the summer of 2012. Riders: Hugo Catchpole, George Unwin, Tom Bethell and Richard Nicholls. Time 10 days 15 hours. On a four-man recumbent bike weighing 114?kg.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been several unicycle completions of the journey. The Guinness World Record for the fastest completion by unicycle is held by Roger Davies and Sam Wakeling, who rode 862 miles (1,387?km) (Lands End to John o' Groats) from 12 September to 18 September 2009 in 6 days, 8 hours and 43 minutes.[12]  They rode large 36-inch-wheeled (910?mm) unicycles equipped with two-speed Schlumpf geared hubs.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest person to cycle from Land's End to John o' Groats is Tony Rathbone (UK, b. 10 December 1932) who was aged 81 years and 162 days when he completed the journey on 21 May 2014. Roger Anthony \\"Tony\\" Rathbone started his journey from Land's End to John o' Groats on 7 May 2014 with his friend, William \\"Billy\\" Skipper. They cycled a total of 1,526.46?km (948.5 miles) and were riding for a total of 79 hours 34 minutes. Guinness World Record[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017 Amelia Sampson aged 22 months completed John o' Groats to Land's End in 14 days in her trailer towed by her parents riding a tandem.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe record time for a runner to complete the route, as reported by the Land's End John o' Groats Club, is nine days and 2 hours, by Andi Rivett.[16] In July 2008, Dan Driver became the first to run the route solo, meaning he carried all his equipment with him whilst he ran it.  He completed the run in just over 17 days.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nFred Hicks was an early record holder. He ran the journey between the 20th and 30th of May, 1977 in 10 days 3 hours and 30 minutes. He ran this for charity, not aiming to set any records, and it was only later, when he was approached by the Road Running association asking if they could pursue the record with Guinness, that he became aware he had set a new record.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 July 2009 British ultramarathon runner Kevin Carr successfully completed the first ever attempt to run the route off-road, becoming the first athlete to run the length of the UK as a fell/trail run. Like Driver, Carr ran unsupported and soloa format commonly known amongst fell runners as a mountain marathon. Carr ran the challenge as part of an event organised by Benumber1, an event that saw several top-level British athletes (mainly Olympians) completing the challenge. The event was designed to encourage school students to participate in sport and to realise the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, whilst raising funds for the British Heart Foundation. The run covered 1,254 miles (2,018?km) over footpaths, bridleways, canal paths, river banks, national trails, fields, moorland and mountains. Over 80% of the route was off-road, the route resorting to tarmac only when necessary to link two trails, or where a trail passed through a village/town. The run took 6 weeks 3 days and 17 hours (including three rest days). Factoring in the rest days, this run called for an average effort of just under 30 miles (50?km) a day, every day, for more than six weeks.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2011, a team of runners from Calday Grange Grammar School, Wirral completed a relay from Land's End to John o' Groats, becoming the first school to do so.[18] They raised S200,000[19] for Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mid summer of 2011 Anthony Band from Surrey ran 1000 miles barefoot, all in aid for Help for heroes. Band took 29 days, running on average 36 miles per day.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 August 2014, Marie-Claire Oziem became the first female runner to complete the distance unsupported and solo.[20] She pushed all her provisions in a pram and camped along the way. Her route consisted of both on and off-road sections. Oziem ran for the charity Mind, based in Taunton for its project Go Wild, Stay Well, which aims to support those with mental illness through the use of various green therapy schemes. She started her run on 23 June and finished on 3 August 2014, regularly running distances of over 32 miles daily.[better?source?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvelyn Burnaby was the younger brother of the famous English Long Rider Colonel Frederick Burnaby. Whereas the elder brother was famous for having ridden across Central Asia and the Ottoman Empire, Evelyn decided to keep his equestrian adventures closer to home. He set off in 1892 to ride from Lands End, Cornwall to John o Groats, Scotland. Evelyns journey was soon serialised in a popular publication, The Country Gentleman, and was published in book form the following year.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur Elliott, a veteran of the Great War, rode his horse, Goldflake, from Lands End to John o Groats in 1955.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006 the mother and daughter team of Vyv and Elsie Wood-Gee rode from John o' Groats to Land's End. Elsie was 13 at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer army officer Grant Nicolle continued the tradition by travelling from John o' Groats to Land's End in 2007 with Marv (solo and unsupported), taking 11 and a half weeks. Grant has published a book called 'Long Trot' through Amazon, documenting the trip. It is generally completed north to south, starting in April to avoid the midges in the Highlands but also to benefit from warmer weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nSean Conway swam the complete route from 30 June 2013 to 11 November 2013. He is the first and only person to swim from Land's End to John o' Groats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fastest time in a wheelchair was achieved in August 2009 by US Navy Pilot Rick Ryan: eight days, 10 hours and 9 minutes.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe record time to complete the 980-mile (1,580?km) journey on a skateboard is 21 days, achieved by Matt Elver, Charlie Mason and Lee Renshaw, who travelled around 50 miles (80?km) per day to raise money for charity.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nMotoring events between the two extremities have been held since the first decade of the 20th century, when the Auto-Cycle Union organised a series of runs for motorcycles.  In 1911, Ivan B. Hart-Davies became the holder of the final Land's End to John o' Groats record for solo motorcycles. Riding his 3.5?hp single-speed Triumph, he covered the 886 miles (1,426?km) in 29 hours, 12 minutes. As his average speed exceeded the then-maximum of 20?mph, further official record attempts were banned by the A. C. U.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Motor Cycling Club (which had been running the London to Land's End Trial since 1908, still held today, at least in name) put on an annual Land's End to John o' Groats Run from 1923 to 1928 which included cars as well as motorcycles.  These events were also known as the End to End. In 2006, BBC Television ran a series of three programmes called The Lost World of Friese-Greene covering Claude Friese-Greene's 1920s-era road trip from Land's End to John o' Groats.  The trip had originally been filmed using the Biocolour process, developed by Claude's father William Friese-Greene and the film had degraded. The original print of Claude's film was subjected to computer enhancement by the British Film Institute to remove the flickering problem inherent in the Biocolour process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, Neal Champion covered 884 miles (1,423?km) from John o' Groats to Land's End in 11 hours, 14 minutes, on a Kawasaki GPZ750 Turbo.[23]\\r\\nin 1984, Christian Conzendorf-Mattner, covered the route from Land's End to John o' Groatsthere and back non-stop other than for fuelin 21 hours 22 mins in a 1941 BMW 327.\\r\\nThe record run was monitored by a team of journalists from a motoring magazine and is the current record for prewar classic cars end to end, non-stop, one driver. The end to end club awards this trophy to new record holders.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 September 1988, Andrew Frankel and Mark Connaughton drove from Land's End to John o' Groats in a standard production Alfa Romeo 164 in 12 hours 30 minutes, including stops for refuelling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, John Brown initiated the Land's End to John o' Groats Historic Reliability Trial, a race for vintage road vehicles.[24]  The race is held each December and is a tough, three-day rally for old and classic cars, built between the 1920s and 1970s.  The route takes a long 1,400-mile (2,300?km) route, using remote upland roads of the west of England, Wales (during the night), the Pennines and Scotland.  Medals are awarded in gold, silver and bronze categories.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15ÿ16 April 1997, Hugh Edeleanu drove the route in a JCB excavator in a time of 22 hours, 10 minutes and 30 seconds.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2001, Wayne Booth became the first person to do the journey by motorcycle without stopping; the 37-year-old completed the historic trip in 14 hours and 52 minutes, averaging 57?mph, on a modified 1,000cc Honda Varedero, complete with additional 74-litre petrol tank. The meticulously researched route of 854 miles (1,374?km) passed through just two sets of traffic lights and was completed within all highway regulations, law and speed limits.[27][28] Booth and the dozen strong support team raised over S1,000 for The National Childbirth Trust and Macmillan Cancer Relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 May 2011, Kevin Sharpe and David Peilow completed the first end-to-end run from John o' Groats to Land's End in an electric car over two days, using only charging stations available to the general public, in a Tesla Roadster sports car.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 August 2011, Darren Whitehead & Tony Dwight travelled 1,071 miles (1,724?km) from John o' Groats to Land's End (including crossing the Welsh border) in 5 days using two ride-on Wheel Horse lawn mowers.[30] They also raised money for charity during the trip which was named The Lawn Way Down.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 November 2013, Lucy Grogan, travelling on a BMW GS R1200 motorbike, and her father Martin Grogan, travelling in a Mini Cooper Works, travelled from Land's End to John o' Groats in 19 hours, leaving Land's End at 4:30am and arriving at John o' Groats at 11:30pm same day. This was in aid of Safe Haven Children's Trust and raised S3,000 for the non-governmental organisation.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2015, Jonathan Porterfield and Chris Ramsey beat the record in a Nissan Leaf electric car, using the existing public rapid charger infrastructure to travel there and back. The route south took 28 hours and 38 minutes, and the return trip 27 hours and 46 minutes. They submitted an application to Guinness World Records to have the quicker time recognised as a record.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 October 2015, Jeff Allan and his son, Ben Cottam-Allan, beat the electric car record in a Tesla Model S completing the northbound route in 19 hours 45 minutes and the southbound route in 18 hours 53 minutes. Jeff prepared the route by cycling in May 2015. They hold the Guinness World Record for shortest charging time from John o' Groats to Land's End of 3 hours  44 minutes 33 seconds.[33][34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 21 August 2017, John Chivers completed the first journey by electric motorcycle (a Zero DSR) from Land's End to John o' Groats, then continued his journey to Orkney and finally to Skaw, on the island of Unst, Shetland. The journey from Land's End to John o' Groats took him four days to complete, breaking the journey up into ten parts, each stop requiring a charge of at least three hours.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 July 2017 Andy Maxfield from Inskip near Preston completed the journey from John O'Groats to Land's End on an unmodified John Deere X750 ride on lawn tractor. The 874 mile journey was completed in a Guinness World Record time[37] of 5 days 8 hours 36 mins with an average speed of around 9mph. This journey was inspired by his father James Maxfield who suffered from Alzheimer's for 13 years with the challenge raising around S9,000 for The Alzheimer's Society. The journey was completed with a support team from John Deere and his two daughters Kathryn and Kaitlyn Maxfield.[38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2017, Tommy Davies and Tom Harvey completed the 841 mile journey in 9 hours and 36 minutes, the fastest time ever recorded between the two points on land, with an overall average of 86.7 mph. They used a specially adapted Audi S5 with an additional fuel tank and an array of equipment to avoid detection from the police and speed cameras. The trip was allegedly tracked via a GPS tracker and filmed, although the footage and data has not been publicly released, presumably in an effort to avoid possible prosecution due to the excessive speed involved.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current fastest journey by bus and coach was set by John and Kirsty Boyd from Runcorn, Cheshire , who travelled from Land's End to John O' Groats in August 2017 using 20 buses/coaches, in three days, 2 hours and 47 minutes.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current fastest journey by local bus (defined as in section 3 of the Transport Act 1980 to be a stage carriage service with stops within 30 miles)[43]  was set by Clive Burgess in September 2016. He travelled from Lands End to John O'Groats using 31 buses, in 3 days, 8 hours and 55 minutes.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2014, to celebrate completing his GCSE exams, 16-year-old Adam Mugliston travelled from Land's End to John o' Groats on 36 buses in four days, 10 hours and 44 minutes.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2011, James Aukett travelled from Land's End to John o' Groats on 31 buses in five days, 7 hours and 25 minutes. James undertook the trip to raise money for children's charity, The Children's Society.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, Richard Elloway of Somerset claims to be the first person to complete the journey from Land's End to John o' Groats and back free of charge by local buses, using the English National Concessionary Pass (a free bus pass for people over 60, allowing free off-peak travel on local bus services throughout England) introduced on 1 April 2008, and the pre-existing equivalent concession for pensioners in Scotland. He completed the first leg of the trip in one week and six hours.[47] The entire journey was completed in two weeks, 8 hours and 30 minutes.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1954, Gertrude Leather travelled by 17 local buses from Land's End to London, at a cost of S1 19s 6d (S1.97?), and the following year travelled from London to John o' Groats by 25 local buses at a cost of S4 5s 9?d (S4.29).[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current fastest route on land public transport takes a timetabled 22 hours 45 minutes, departing Land's End car park at 14:35 on day 1 and arriving at John o' Groats ferry terminal car park at 13:20 on day 2. This involves a bus to Penzance, trains to Crewe to meet the LondonÿInverness sleeper train, then the following morning buses via Wick to John o' Groats. As of  January?2011[update], an ordinary one-way railway fare for the rail section of the journey cost S216.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Clark and G.

The trip took a little over six days and was completed from south to north.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded trip from north to south was by John Caston, Brian Pushman, Alex Heron and Henry Glasse in September 2009 and took five days.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2016 a group of four pilots completed the trip from north to south in 6.5 days. This included double amputee Cayle Royce, who became the first person to fly the route in a ParaTrike.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005 Surrey-based golfer and member of the Kent Golf Society David Sullivan walked from John o' Groats to Land's End hitting golf balls all the way. He travelled the 1,100 miles (1,800?km) in seven weeks to be eligible for the Guinness Book of Records as the longest golf hole. He raised money for the Variety Club, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami Appeal, and the Orpheus Centre, a residential arts and learning facility for the young and disabled in Surrey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fastest passage between the two points was made in 1988 by a McDonnell Douglas F-4K Phantom in a time of 46 minutes 44 seconds [52]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 May 2014 a team of four set off to complete Beeline Britain - a journey from Land's End to John o' Groats in a straight line.  This never before attempted route was completed in 28 days and required the two biggest sea kayak crossings ever completed in UK waters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team then kayaked, biked and hiked the remainder of the route which went via:\\r\\nIsle of Man - Dalmellington - Glasgow - Creiff - traversing Ben Macdui the second highest mountain in the UK - Lossiemouth - across the Moray Firth - Lybster - John o' Groats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project was devised and managed by Ian O'Grady.  He recruited the Team GB Paralympian Nick Beighton, Adam Harmer, a professional kayak coach and University Lecturer, Tori James who was the first Welsh woman to stand on the summit of Mount Everest.  Beeline Britain's aim was to raise funds and awareness for Blesma, the limbless veterans charity.  The project gained full royal endorsement from the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, and has to date raised over S20,000 for Blesma.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole journey was captured by filmmaker Ian Burton for the feature documentary As The Crow Flies [53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Land's EndÿJohn o' Groats Association presents the Jack Adams/Richard Elloway Trophy annually to the youngest person to have completed the journey other than as a passenger in a motor vehicle. Henry Cole completed the journey in June 2006, he was aged four. He cycled over 31 days.  He started school in the following September, and was presented with the Jack Adams/Richard Elloway Trophy in January 2007. Sophie George is currently the youngest recipient of the Jack Adams/Richard Elloway Trophy. She completed the journey by bus and train in August 2016 at the age of two years and 10 months and was awarded the trophy in January 2017.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nReg Savill is oldest person to complete the journey on foot (although in the reverse direction from John o' Groats to Land's End), at the age of 74.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three organisations supporting people undertaking the journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil Union with England in 1707, Scotland's equivalent of the phrase was often \\"John o' Groats to Maidenkirk\\", as Maidenkirk (Kirkmaiden) was traditionally considered Scotland's southernmost point, a 388-mile (624?km) trip. This can be found in Robert Burns' poem On Captain Grose's Peregrinations thro' Scotland[59] and the song, The Lady of Kenmure:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe southernmost village in Scotland is actually nearby Drummore, which has grown to a latitude several metres south of Kirkmaiden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe length of the English mainland is delineated by the distance between Land's End and Marshall Meadows Bay in Northumberland. The distance is 556 miles (895?km) by road or 426 miles (686?km) as the crow flies. The traversal of the length of England is sometimes used to define charity events such as walks and cycle-rides.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoad walking\\r\\n\\r\\nOffroad walking\\r\\n\\r\\nCycling","input":"How long does it take to cycle from lands end to john o'groats?"},{"output":"Alaska","context":"The Aleutian Islands (Aleut: Tanam Unangaa, literally \\"Land of the Aleuts\\"; pronounced (/??lu???n/;[2][3] possibly from Chukchi aliat, \\"island\\") are a chain of 14 large volcanic islands and 55 smaller ones belonging to both the U.S. state of Alaska and the Russian federal subject of Kamchatka Krai.[1] They form part of the Aleutian Arc in the Northern Pacific Ocean, occupying an area of 6,821 sq mi (17,666?km2) and extending about 1,200?mi (1,900?km) westward from the Alaska Peninsula toward the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, and mark a dividing line between the Bering Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Crossing longitude 180, at which point east and west longitude end, the archipelago contains both the westernmost part of the United States by longitude (Amatignak Island) and the easternmost by longitude (Semisopochnoi Island). The westernmost U.S. island in real terms, however, is Attu Island, west of which runs the International Date Line. While nearly all the archipelago is part of Alaska and is usually considered as being in the \\"Alaskan Bush\\", at the extreme western end, the small, geologically related Commander Islands belong to Russia.\\r\\nThe islands, with their 57 volcanoes, form the northernmost part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Physiographically, they are a distinct section of the larger Pacific Border province, which in turn is part of the larger Pacific Mountain System physiographic division.\\r\\nThese Islands are most known for the battles and skirmishes that occurred there during the Aleutian Islands Campaign of World War II. It was one of only two attacks on the United States during that war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe islands, known before 1867 as the Catherine Archipelago, comprise five groups (east to west)\\r\\nAll five are located between 51 and 55 N latitude and 172 E and 163 W longitude[4]. The largest islands in the Aleutians are Attu (the farthest from the mainland), and Unalaska, Umnak, and Unimak in the Fox Islands. The largest of those is Unimak Island, with an area of 1,571.41?mi2 (4,069.9?km2), followed by Unalaska Island, the only other Aleutian Island with an area over 1,000 square miles (2,600 km2).\\r\\nThe axis of the archipelago near the mainland of Alaska has a southwest trend, but near 179 its direction changes to the northwest. This change of direction corresponds to a curve in the line of volcanic fissures that have contributed their products to the building of the islands. Such curved chains are repeated about the Pacific Ocean in the Kuril Islands, the Japanese chain, and in the Philippines. All these island arcs are at the edge of the Pacific Plate and experience much seismic activity, but are still habitable; the Aleutians lie between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates.[citation needed] The general elevation is greatest in the eastern islands and least in the western. The island chain is a western continuation of the Aleutian Range on the mainland.[5]\\r\\nThe great majority of the islands bear evident marks of volcanic origin, and there are numerous volcanic cones on the north side of the chain, some of them active; many of the islands, however, are not wholly volcanic, but contain crystalline or sedimentary rocks, and also amber and beds of lignite. The coasts are rocky and surf-worn, and the approaches are exceedingly dangerous, the land rising immediately from the coasts to steep, bold mountains.[5]\\r\\nThese volcanic islands reach heights of 6,200 feet (1,900?m). Makushin Volcano (5,691 feet (1,735?m)) located on Unalaska Island, is not quite visible from within the town of Unalaska, though the steam rising from its cone is visible on a (rare) clear day. Residents of Unalaska need only to climb one of the smaller hills in the area, such as Pyramid Peak or Mt. Newhall, to get a good look at the snow-covered cone. The volcanic Bogoslof and Fire Islands, which rose from the sea in 1796 and 1883 respectively, lie about 30 miles (50?km) west of Unalaska Bay.[5]\\r\\nIn 1906, a new volcanic cone rose between the islets of Bogoslof and Grewingk, near Unalaska, followed by another in 1907. These cones were nearly demolished by an explosive eruption on September 1, 1907.[5] Newly found information in 2017, the volcanic cone erupted sending ash and ice particles 30,000 feet (9000 m) in the air.[6]\\r\\nImage of the islands taken by the STS-56 crew.\\r\\nThese cloud formations were seen over the western Aleutian Islands.\\r\\nASTER image of the islands.\\r\\nAleutian Islands on May 15, 2014, by NASAs Aqua satellite.\\r\\nThe climate of the islands is oceanic, with moderate and fairly uniform temperatures and heavy rainfall. Fogs are almost constant. Summer weather is much cooler than Southeast Alaska (around Sitka), but the winter temperature of the islands and of the Alaska Panhandle is very nearly the same.[5] During the winter the islands are the center for the semi-permanent low-pressure area called the Aleutian low.\\r\\nThe mean annual temperature for Unalaska, the most populated island of the group, is about 38?F (3?C), being about 30?F (?1?C) in January and about 52?F (11?C) in August. The highest and lowest temperatures recorded on the islands are 78?F (26?C) and 5?F (?15?C) respectively. The average annual rainfall is about 80 inches (2,000?mm), and Unalaska, with about 250 rainy days per year, is said to be one of the rainiest places within the U.S.[5]\\r\\nThe growing season lasts approximately 135 days, from early in May until late in September, but agriculture is limited to the raising of few vegetables. With the exception of some stunted willows, the vast majority of the chain is devoid of native trees.[5] On some of the islands, such as Adak and Amaknak, there are a few coniferous trees growing, remnants of the Russian period. While tall trees grow in many cold climates, Aleutian conifers? some estimated to be two hundred years old? rarely reach a height of even 10 feet (3?m), and many of them are still less than 5 feet (1.5?m) tall. This is because the islands, much like the Falklands and other islands of similar latitudes, experience such strong winds that taller trees are vulnerable to snapping off.\\r\\nInstead of trees, the islands are covered with a luxuriant, dense growth of herbage and shrubs, including crowberry, bluejoint, grasses, sedges, and many flowering plants.[7] There are areas of peat bog near the coasts. Endemic plants include the endangered Aleutian shield fern.\\r\\nThe Aleutians are home to many large colonies of seabirds. Buldir Island has 21 breeding seabird species, including the Bering Sea-endemic red-legged kittiwake. Large seabird colonies are also present at Kiska, Gareloi, Semisopochnoi, Bogoslof, and others. The islands are also frequented by vagrant Asiatic birds, including the common rosefinch, Siberian rubythroat, bluethroat, lanceolated warbler, and the first North American record of the intermediate egret.[8]\\r\\nThe habitats of the Aleutians are largely unspoiled, but wildlife is affected by competition from introduced species such as cattle, caribou, and foxes. Nearly all of the Aleutians are protected as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge and the Aleutian Islands Wilderness.[9]\\r\\nObservations have identified sea otters as a keystone species along the coasts of many of the Aleutian Islands. Their presence encourages the growth of kelp forests, as the otters control sea urchin populations (as large populations of sea urchins can create urchin barrens by clearing away kelp stands).[10]\\r\\nOn the less mountainous islands, the raising of sheep and reindeer was once believed to be practicable.[7] There are bison on islands near Sand Point. Sheep raising seems to have died off with the advent of synthetic fibers, which lowered the value of wool. During the 1980s, there were some llama being raised on Unalaska. The current economy is primarily based on fishing, and the presence of U.S. military. The only crop is potato. Chickens are raised in barns under protection from the cold.\\r\\nIn addition to a partial air service and a ferry service, the Alaska Marine Highway passes through many of the U.S. islands.\\r\\nThe native people refer to themselves as Unangan, and are now generally known by most non-natives as the \\"Aleut\\". The Aleut language is one of the two main branches of the EskimoÿAleut language family. This family is not known to be related to any others. The 2000 U.S. Census recorded a population of 8,162 on the islands, of whom 4,283 were living in the main settlement of Unalaska.\\r\\nBecause of the location of the islands, stretching like a broken bridge from Asia to America, many anthropologists believe they were a route of the first human occupants of the Americas. The earliest known evidence of human occupation in the Americas is much farther south; the early human sites in Alaska have probably been submerged by rising waters during the current interglacial period. People living in the Aleutian Islands developed fine skills in hunting, fishing, and basketry. Hunters made their weapons and watercraft. The baskets are noted for being finely woven with carefully shredded stalks of beach rye.\\r\\nExplorers, traders and missionaries arrived from Russia beginning in 1741.\\r\\nIn 1741, the Russian government sent Vitus Bering, a Dane in the service of Russia, and Aleksei Chirikov, a Russian, in the ships Saint Peter and Saint Paul on a voyage of discovery in the Northern Pacific. After the ships were separated by a storm; Chirikov discovered several eastern islands of the Aleutian group, and Bering discovered several of the western islands. Bering was shipwrecked and lost his life in the Komandorski Islands (Commander Islands), one of which now bears his name (Bering Island). The survivors of Bering's party reached the Kamchatka Peninsula in a boat constructed from the wreckage of their ship, and reported that the islands were rich in fur-bearing animals.[5]\\r\\nSiberian fur hunters flocked to the Commander Islands and gradually moved eastward across the Aleutian Islands to the mainland. In this manner, Russia gained a foothold on the northwestern coast of North America. The Aleutian Islands consequently belonged to Russia, until that country transferred all its possessions in North America to the U.S. in 1867.[5]\\r\\nDuring the consolidation of the Russian-American Company there was sporadic conflict with the native population (frequently disastrous to the poorly armed and vastly outnumbered Russians). The colonies soon entered a relatively stable state based on cooperation, intermarriage, and official policies that provided social status, education, and professional training to children of mixed Aleut-Russian birth.[11] Within a generation, the day-to-day administration of the Russian-American colonies was largely in the hands of native-born Alaskans. Reversing the usual trend in colonization where indigenous technologies are replaced, the Russians adopted the Aleut kayak, or baidarka, sea otter hunting techniques, and the working of native copper deposits. The Russians instituted public education, preservation of the Aleut language through transliteration of religious and other texts into Aleut via an adaptation of the Cyrillic alphabet, vaccination of the native population against smallpox, and science-based sea mammal conservation policies that were ahead of their time.[11]\\r\\nBy 1760, the Russian merchant Andrian Tolstykh had made a detailed census in the vicinity of Adak and extended Russian citizenship to the Aleuts.\\r\\nDuring his third and last voyage in 1778, Captain James Cook surveyed the eastern portion of the Aleutian archipelago, accurately determined the position of some of the more important islands, and corrected many errors of former navigators.[5]\\r\\nAmong the first Christian missionaries to arrive in the Aleutian Islands was a party of ten Russian Orthodox monks and priests, who arrived in 1793. Within two years, a monk named Herman was the only survivor of that party. He settled on Spruce Island, near Kodiak Island, and often defended the rights of the Aleuts against the Russian trading companies. He is now known in the Orthodox Church as Saint Herman of Alaska.\\r\\nAnother early Christian missionary of the Russian Orthodox Church was Father Veniaminov who arrived in Unalaska in 1824. He was named Bishop Innokentii in 1840 and moved to Sitka. He is now known in the Orthodox Church as Saint Innocent of Alaska.\\r\\nThe principal settlements were on Unalaska Island. The oldest was Iliuliuk (also called Unalaska), settled in 1760ÿ1775, with a customs house and an Orthodox church.\\r\\nAfter the American purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867, further development took place. New buildings included a Methodist mission and orphanage, and the headquarters for a considerable fleet of United States revenue cutters, which patrolled the sealing grounds of the Pribilof Islands.[5] The first public school in Unalaska opened in 1883.\\r\\nThe U.S. Congress extended American citizenship to all Native Americans (and this law has been held to include the indigenous peoples of Alaska) in 1924. A hospital was built in Unalaska in 1933 by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs.\\r\\nDuring World War II, small parts of the Aleutian islands were occupied by Japanese forces, when Attu and Kiska were invaded in order to divert American forces away from the main Japanese attack at Midway Atoll. The U.S. Navy, having broken the Japanese naval codes, knew that this was just a diversion disputed, and it did not expend large amounts of effort in defending the islands. More than 90 Americans were taken to Japan as prisoners of war. Most of the civilian population (over 800) of the Aleutians and Pribilovians was detained by the United States in camps in the Alaska Panhandle. During the Aleutian Islands Campaign, American forces invaded Japanese-held Attu and defeated the Japanese. American and Canadian troops later launched an invasion of Kiska, but Japanese forces had already withdrawn, ending the campaign in the islands.\\r\\nJune 3, 2002 was celebrated as Dutch Harbor Remembrance Day. The governor of Alaska ordered state flags lowered to half-staff to honor the 78 soldiers who died during the two-day Japanese air attack in 1942. The Aleutian World War II National Historic Area Visitors Center opened that month.\\r\\nThe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act became law in 1971. In 1977, the Ounalashka Corporation (from Unalaska) declared a dividend. This was the first village corporation to declare and pay a dividend to its shareholders.\\r\\nThe U.S. conducted underground tests of nuclear weapons on Amchitka Island from 1965 to 1971 as part of the Vela Uniform program. The final detonation, the Cannikin, was the largest underground nuclear explosion by the U.S.\\r\\nRussian Aleutians is organized as Aleutsky District in Kamchatka Krai.

The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO[2][3][4][5] in 1955 per the London and Paris Conferences of 1954,[6][7][8][9][10] but it is also considered to have been motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe.[11]\\r\\nThe Warsaw Pact was established as a balance of power[12] or counterweight[13] to NATO; there was no direct confrontation between them. Instead, the conflict was fought on an ideological basis and in proxy wars. Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact led to the expansion of military forces and their integration into the respective blocs.[13] Its largest military engagement was the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 (with the participation of all Pact nations except Albania, Romania and East Germany),[12] which, in part, resulted in Albania withdrawing from the pact less than a month later. The Pact began to unravel in its entirety with the spread of the Revolutions of 1989 through the Eastern Bloc, beginning with the Solidarity movement in Poland[14] and its electoral success in June 1989.\\r\\nEast Germany withdrew from the Pact in 1990. On 25 February 1991, the Pact was declared at an end at a meeting of defence and foreign ministers from the six remaining member states in Hungary. The USSR itself was dissolved in December 1991, although most of the former Soviet republics formed the Collective Security Treaty Organization shortly thereafter. Throughout the following 20 years, the seven Warsaw Pact countries outside the USSR each joined NATO (East Germany through its reunification with West Germany; and the Czech and Slovak republics as separate countries).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Western Bloc, the Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance is often called the Warsaw Pact military allianceabbreviated WAPA, Warpac and WP. Elsewhere, in the former member states, the Warsaw Treaty is known as:\\r\\nThe Warsaw Treaty's organization was two-fold: the Political Consultative Committee handled political matters, and the Combined Command of Pact Armed Forces controlled the assigned multi-national forces, with headquarters in Warsaw, Poland. Furthermore, the Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization which commanded and controlled all the military forces of the member countries was also a First Deputy Minister of Defence of the USSR, and the Chief of Combined Staff of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization was also a First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR. Therefore, although ostensibly an international collective security alliance, the USSR dominated the Warsaw Treaty armed forces.[15]\\r\\nThe strategy behind the formation of the Warsaw Pact was driven by the desire of the Soviet Union to dominate Central and Eastern Europe. The Soviets wanted to keep their part of Europe theirs and not let the Americans take it from them. This policy was driven by ideological and geostrategic reasons. Ideologically, the Soviet Union arrogated the right to define socialism and communism and act as the leader of the global socialist movement. A corollary to this idea was the necessity of intervention if a country appeared to be violating core socialist ideas and Communist Party functions, which was explicitly stated in the Brezhnev Doctrine.[16] Geostrategic principles also drove the Soviet Union with the desire to create a buffer zone to prevent invasion of its territory by Western European powers.\\r\\nBefore the creation of the Warsaw Pact, Czechoslovak leadership, fearful of a rearmed Germany, sought to create a security pact with East Germany and Poland.[9] These states protested strongly against the re-militarization of West Germany.[17] The Warsaw Pact was primarily put in place as a consequence of the rearming of West Germany inside NATO. Soviet leaders, like many European countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain, feared Germany being once again a military power and a direct threat. The terrible consequences of German militarism remained a fresh memory among the Soviets and Eastern Europeans.[3][4][18][19][20] As the Soviet Union already had bilateral treaties with all of its eastern satellites, the Pact has been long considered 'superfluous',[21] and because of the rushed way in which it was conceived, NATO officials labeled it as a 'cardboard castle'.[22] Previously, in March 1954, the USSR, fearing the restoration of German militarism in West Germany, requested admission to NATO.[23][24][25]\\r\\nThe Soviet request to join NATO arose in the aftermath of the Berlin Conference of JanuaryÿFebruary 1954. Soviet foreign minister Molotov made proposals to have Germany reunified[26] and elections for a pan-German government,[27] under conditions of withdrawal of the four powers' armies and German neutrality,[28] but all were refused by the other foreign ministers, Dulles (USA), Eden (UK) and Bidault (France).[29] Proposals for the reunification of Germany were nothing new: earlier on 20 March 1952, talks about a German reunification, initiated by the so-called 'Stalin Note', ended after the United Kingdom, France and the United States insisted that a unified Germany should not be neutral and should be free to join the European Defence Community and rearm. James Dunn (USA), who met in Paris with Eden, Adenauer and Robert Schuman (France), affirmed that \\"the object should be to avoid discussion with the Russians and to press on the European Defense Community\\".[30] According to John Gaddis \\"there was little inclination in Western capitals to explore this offer\\" from USSR.[31] While historian Rolf Steininger asserts that Adenauer's conviction that \\"neutralization means sovietization\\" was the main factor in the rejection of the Soviet proposals,[32] Adenauer also feared that German unification might have resulted in the end of the CDU's dominance in the West German Bundestag.[33]\\r\\nConsequently, Molotov, fearing that the EDC would be directed in the future against the USSR and \\"seeking to prevent the formation of groups of European States directed against other European States\\",[34] made a proposal for a General European Treaty on Collective Security in Europe \\"open to all European States without regard as to their social systems\\"[34] which would have included the unified Germany (thus making the EDC ÿ perceived by the USSR as a threat ÿ unusable). But Eden, Dulles and Bidault opposed the proposal.[35]\\r\\nOne month later, the proposed European Treaty was rejected not only by supporters of the EDC but also by Western opponents of the European Defence Community (like French Gaullist leader Palewski) who perceived it as \\"unacceptable in its present form because it excludes the USA from participation in the collective security system in Europe\\".[36] The Soviets then decided to make a new proposal to the governments of the USA, UK and France to accept the participation of the USA in the proposed General European Agreement.[36] And considering that another argument deployed against the Soviet proposal was that it was perceived by Western powers as \\"directed against the North Atlantic Pact and its liquidation\\",[36][37] the Soviets decided to declare their \\"readiness to examine jointly with other interested parties the question of the participation of the USSR in the North Atlantic bloc\\", specifying that \\"the admittance of the USA into the General European Agreement should not be conditional on the three Western powers agreeing to the USSR joining the North Atlantic Pact\\".[36]\\r\\nAgain all proposals, including the request to join NATO, were rejected by the UK, US and French governments shortly after.[25][38] Emblematic was the position of British General Hastings Ismay, supporter of NATO expansion, who said that NATO \\"must grow until the whole free world gets under one umbrella.\\"[39][incomplete short citation] He opposed the request to join NATO made by the USSR in 1954[40] saying that \\"the Soviet request to join NATO is like an unrepentant burglar requesting to join the police force\\".[41]\\r\\nIn April 1954 Adenauer made his first visit to the USA meeting Nixon, Eisenhower and Dulles. Ratification of EDC was delaying but the US representatives made it clear to Adenauer that EDC would have to become a part of NATO.[42]\\r\\nMemories of the Nazi occupation were still strong, and the rearmament of Germany was feared by France too.[4][43] On 30 August 1954 French Parliament rejected the EDC, thus ensuring its failure[44] and blocking a major objective of US policy towards Europe: to associate Germany militarily with the West.[45] The US Department of State started to elaborate alternatives: Germany would be invited to join NATO or, in the case of French obstructionism, strategies to circumvent a French veto would be implemented in order to obtain a German rearmament outside NATO.[46]\\r\\nOn 23 October 1954 ÿ only nine years after Allies (UK, USA and USSR) defeated Nazi Germany ending World War II in Europe ÿ the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany to the North Atlantic Pact was finally decided. The incorporation of West Germany into the organization on 9 May 1955 was described as \\"a decisive turning point in the history of our continent\\" by Halvard Lange, Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway at the time.[47] In November 1954, the USSR requested a new European Security Treaty,[48] in order to make a final attempt to not have a remilitarized West Germany potentially opposed to the Soviet Union, with no success.\\r\\nOn 14 May 1955, the USSR and other seven European countries \\"reaffirming their desire for the establishment of a system of European collective security based on the participation of all European states irrespective of their social and political systems\\"[49] established the Warsaw Pact in response to the integration of the Federal Republic of Germany into NATO,[3][5] declaring that: \\"a remilitarized Western Germany and the integration of the latter in the North-Atlantic bloc [...] increase the danger of another war and constitutes a threat to the national security of the peaceable states; [...] in these circumstances the peaceable European states must take the necessary measures to safeguard their security\\".[49]\\r\\nOne of the founding members, East Germany was allowed to re-arm by the Soviet Union and the National People's Army was established as the armed forces of the country to counter the rearmament of West Germany.\\r\\nThe eight member countries of the Warsaw Pact pledged the mutual defence of any member who would be attacked. Relations among the treaty signatories were based upon mutual non-intervention in the internal affairs of the member countries, respect for national sovereignty, and political independence. However, almost all governments of those member states were indirectly controlled by the Soviet Union.\\r\\nThe founding signatories to the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance consisted of the following communist governments:\\r\\nIn July 1963 the Mongolian People's Republic asked to join the Warsaw Pact under Article 9 of the treaty. Due to the emerging Sino-Soviet split, Mongolia remained on observer status. The Soviet Government agreed to station troops in Mongolia in 1966.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor 36 years, NATO and the Warsaw Pact never directly waged war against each other in Europe; the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies implemented strategic policies aimed at the containment of each other in Europe, while working and fighting for influence within the wider Cold War on the international stage. These included the Korean War, Vietnam War, Bay of Pigs invasion, Dirty War, CambodianÿVietnamese War and the others.\\r\\nIn 1956, following the declaration of the Imre Nagy government of withdrawal of Hungary from the Warsaw Pact, Soviet troops entered the country and removed the government. Soviet forces crushed the nationwide revolt, leading to the death of an estimated 2,500 Hungarian citizens.\\r\\nThe multi-national Communist armed forces' sole joint action was the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. All member countries, with the exception of the Socialist Republic of Romania and the People's Republic of Albania, participated in the invasion.\\r\\nBeginning at the Cold War's conclusion, in late 1989, popular civil and political public discontent forced the Communist governments of the Warsaw Treaty countries from power, while independent national politics made feasible with the perestroika and glasnost induced institutional collapse of Communist government in the USSR.[50]\\r\\nBetween 1989 and 1991, Communist governments were overthrown in Albania, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.\\r\\nOn 25 February 1991, the Warsaw Pact was declared disbanded at a meeting of defence and foreign ministers from remaining Pact countries meeting in Hungary.[51] On 1 July 1991, in Prague, the Czechoslovak President Vclav Havel formally ended the 1955 Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance and so disestablished the Warsaw Treaty after 36 years of military alliance with the USSR.[52] In fact, the treaty was de facto disbanded in December 1989 during the violent revolution in Romania, which toppled the communist government, without military intervention from other member states.[citation needed] The USSR disestablished itself in December 1991.\\r\\nOn 12 March 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland joined NATO; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia joined in March 2004; Albania joined on 1 April 2009.\\r\\nRussia and some other post-USSR states joined in the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in 1992, or the Shanghai Five in 1996 (renamed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) after Uzbekistan's addition in 2001).\\r\\nIn November 2005, the Polish government opened its Warsaw Treaty archives to the Institute of National Remembrance, who published some 1,300 declassified documents in January 2006. Yet the Polish government reserved publication of 100 documents, pending their military declassification. Eventually, 30 of the reserved 100 documents were published; 70 remained secret and unpublished. Among the documents published is the Warsaw Treaty's nuclear war plan, Seven Days to the River Rhine ÿ a short, swift counter-attack capturing Austria, Denmark, Germany and Netherlands east of River Rhine, using nuclear weapons, in self-defence, after a NATO first strike. The plan originated as a 1979 field training exercise war game and metamorphosed into official Warsaw Treaty battle doctrine, until the late 1980s ÿ which is why the People's Republic of Poland was a nuclear weapons base, first, to 178, then, to 250 tactical-range rockets. Doctrinally, as a Soviet-style (offensive) battle plan, Seven Days to the River Rhine gave commanders few defensive-war strategies for fighting NATO in Warsaw Treaty territory.[citation needed]\\r\\nBadge Warsaw Pact.

A server computer running Hyper-V can be configured to expose individual virtual machines to one or more networks.\\r\\nHyper-V was first released alongside Windows Server 2008, and has been available without charge for all the Windows Server and some client operating systems since.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA beta version of Hyper-V was shipped with certain x86-64 editions of Windows Server 2008. The finalized version was released on June 26, 2008 and was delivered through Windows Update.[3] Hyper-V has since been released with every version of Windows Server.[4][5][6]\\r\\nMicrosoft provides Hyper-V through two channels:\\r\\nHyper-V Server 2008 was released on October 1, 2008. It consists of Windows Server 2008 Server Core and Hyper-V role; other Windows Server 2008 roles are disabled, and there are limited Windows services.[8] Hyper-V Server 2008 is limited to a command-line interface used to configure the host OS, physical hardware, and software. A menu driven CLI interface and some freely downloadable script files simplify configuration. In addition, Hyper-V Server supports remote access via Remote Desktop Connection. However, administration and configuration of the host OS and the guest virtual machines is generally done over the network, using either Microsoft Management Consoles on another Windows computer or System Center Virtual Machine Manager. This allows much easier \\"point and click\\" configuration, and monitoring of the Hyper-V Server.\\r\\nHyper-V Server 2008 R2 (an edition of Windows Server 2008 R2) was made available in September 2009 and includes Windows PowerShell v2 for greater CLI control. Remote access to Hyper-V Server requires CLI configuration of network interfaces and Windows Firewall. Also using a Windows Vista PC to administer Hyper-V Server 2008 R2 is not fully supported.\\r\\nHyper-V implements isolation of virtual machines in terms of a partition. A partition is a logical unit of isolation, supported by the hypervisor, in which each guest operating system executes. A hypervisor instance has to have at least one parent partition, running a supported version of Windows Server (2008 and later). The virtualization stack runs in the parent partition and has direct access to the hardware devices. The parent partition then creates the child partitions which host the guest OSs. A parent partition creates child partitions using the hypercall API, which is the application programming interface exposed by Hyper-V.[9]\\r\\nA child partition does not have access to the physical processor, nor does it handle its real interrupts. Instead, it has a virtual view of the processor and runs in Guest Virtual Address, which, depending on the configuration of the hypervisor, might not necessarily be the entire virtual address space. Depending on VM configuration, Hyper-V may expose only a subset of the processors to each partition. The hypervisor handles the interrupts to the processor, and redirects them to the respective partition using a logical Synthetic Interrupt Controller (SynIC). Hyper-V can hardware accelerate the address translation of Guest Virtual Address-spaces by using second level address translation provided by the CPU, referred to as EPT on Intel and RVI (formerly NPT) on AMD.\\r\\nChild partitions do not have direct access to hardware resources, but instead have a virtual view of the resources, in terms of virtual devices. Any request to the virtual devices is redirected via the VMBus to the devices in the parent partition, which will manage the requests. The VMBus is a logical channel which enables inter-partition communication. The response is also redirected via the VMBus. If the devices in the parent partition are also virtual devices, it will be redirected further until it reaches the parent partition, where it will gain access to the physical devices. Parent partitions run a Virtualization Service Provider (VSP), which connects to the VMBus and handles device access requests from child partitions. Child partition virtual devices internally run a Virtualization Service Client (VSC), which redirect the request to VSPs in the parent partition via the VMBus. This entire process is transparent to the guest OS.\\r\\nVirtual devices can also take advantage of a Windows Server Virtualization feature, named Enlightened I/O, for storage, networking and graphics subsystems, among others. Enlightened I/O is a specialized virtualization-aware implementation of high level communication protocols, like SCSI, that allows bypassing any device emulation layer and takes advantage of VMBus directly. This makes the communication more efficient, but requires the guest OS to support Enlightened I/O.\\r\\nCurrently only the following operating systems support Enlightened I/O, allowing them therefore to run faster as guest operating systems under Hyper-V than other operating systems that need to use slower emulated hardware:\\r\\nThe stand-alone Hyper-V Server variant does not require an existing of Windows Server 2008 nor Windows Server 2008 R2. The standalone installation is called Microsoft Hyper-V Server for the non-R2 version and Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 R2. Microsoft Hyper-V Server is built with components of Windows and has a Windows Server Core user experience. None of the other roles of Windows Server are available in Microsoft Hyper-V Server. This version supports up to 64?VMs per system.[18] System requirements of Microsoft Hyper-V Server are the same for supported guest operating systems and processor, but differ in the following:[19]\\r\\nHyper-V Server 2012 R2 has the same capabilities as the standard Hyper-V role in Windows Server 2012 R2 and supports 1024 active VMs.[20]\\r\\nThe following table lists supported guest operating systems on Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.[21]\\r\\nFedora 8 or 9 are unsupported; however, they have been reported to run.[21][22][23][24]\\r\\nThird-party support for FreeBSD 8.2 and later guests is provided by a partnership between NetApp and Citrix.[25] This includes both emulated and paravirtualized modes of operation, as well as several HyperV integration services.[26]\\r\\nWindows 10 Home does not support Hyper-V.[27]\\r\\nDesktop virtualization (VDI) products from third-party companies (such as Quest Software vWorkspace, Citrix XenDesktop, Systancia AppliDis Fusion[28] and Ericom PowerTerm WebConnect) provide the ability to host and centrally manage desktop virtual machines in the data center while giving end users a full PC desktop experience.\\r\\nGuest operating systems with Enlightened I/O and a hypervisor-aware kernel such as Windows Server 2008 and later server versions, Windows Vista SP1 and later clients and offerings from Citrix XenServer and Novell will be able to use the host resources better since VSC drivers in these guests communicate with the VSPs directly over VMBus.[29] Non-\\"enlightened\\" operating systems will run with emulated I/O;[30] however, integration components (which include the VSC drivers) are available for Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP1 and Linux to achieve better performance. Xen-enabled Linux guest distributions can also be paravirtualized in Hyper-V. As of 2013[update] Microsoft officially supports only SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP1/SP2 x86 and x64 Editions in this way,[31] though any Xen-enabled Linux should be able to run. In February 2008, Red Hat and Microsoft signed a virtualization pact for hypervisor interoperability with their respective server operating systems, to enable Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to be officially supported on Hyper-V.[32]\\r\\nIn July 2009, Microsoft submitted Hyper-V drivers to the kernel, which improve the performance of virtual Linux guest systems in a Windows hosted environment. Microsoft was forced to submit the code when it was discovered that Microsoft had incorporated a Hyper-V network driver with GPL-licensed components statically linked to closed-source binaries.[33] Hyper-V provides basic virtualization support for Linux guests out of the box. Paravirtualization support is, however, available by installing the Linux Integration Components or Satori InputVSC drivers. On July 20, 2009, Microsoft submitted these drivers for inclusion in the Linux kernel under the terms of the GPL,[34] so that kernels from 2.6.32 may include inbuilt Hyper-V paravirtualization support.\\r\\nHyper-V in Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 changes the support list above as follows:[35]\\r\\nHyper-V, like Microsoft Virtual Server and Windows Virtual PC, saves each guest OS to a single virtual hard disk file. It supports the older .vhd format, as well as the newer .vhdx. Older .vhd files from Virtual Server 2005, Virtual PC 2004 and Virtual PC 2007 can be copied and used in Hyper-V, but any old virtual machine integration software (equivalents of Hyper-V Integration Services) must be removed from the virtual machine. After the migrated guest OS is configured and started using Hyper-V, the guest OS will detect changes to the (virtual) hardware. Installing \\"Hyper-V Integration Services\\" installs five services to improve performance, at the same time adding the new guest video and network card drivers.\\r\\nHyper-V does not virtualize audio hardware. Before Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, it was possible to work around this issue by connecting to the virtual machine with Remote Desktop Connection over a network connection and use its audio redirection feature.[36][37] Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 add the enhanced session mode which provides redirection without a network connection.[38]\\r\\nOptical drives virtualized in the guest VM are read-only.[39] Officially Hyper-V does not support the host/root operating system's optical drives to pass-through in guest VMs. As a result, burning to discs, audio CDs, video CD/DVD-Video playback are not supported; however, a workaround exists using the iSCSI protocol. Setting up an iSCSI target on the host machine with the optical drive can then be talked to by the standard Microsoft iSCSI initiator. Microsoft produces their own iSCSI Target software or alternative third party products can be used.[40]\\r\\nOn CPUs without Second Level Address Translation, installation of most WDDM accelerated graphics drivers on the primary OS will cause a dramatic drop in graphic performance. This occurs because the graphics drivers access memory in a pattern that causes the Translation lookaside buffer to be flushed frequently.[12]\\r\\nIn Windows Server 2008, Microsoft officially supported Hyper-V only with the default VGA drivers,[41] which do not support Windows Aero, higher resolutions, rotation, or multi-monitor display. However, unofficial workarounds were available in certain cases. Older non-WDDM graphics drivers sometimes did not cause performance issues, though these drivers did not always install smoothly on Windows Server. Intel integrated graphics cards did not cause TLB flushing even with WDDM drivers.[42] Some NVidia graphics drivers did not experience problems so long as Windows Aero was turned off and no 3D applications were running.[12]\\r\\nIn Windows Server 2008 R2, Microsoft added support for Second Level Address Translation to Hyper-V. Since SLAT is not required to run Hyper-V with Windows Server,[43] the problem will continue to occur if a non-SLAT CPU is used with accelerated graphics drivers. However, SLAT is required to run Hyper-V on client versions of Windows 8.[44]\\r\\nHyper-V in Windows Server 2008 does not support \\"live migration\\" of guest VMs (where \\"live migration\\" is defined as maintaining network connections and uninterrupted services during VM migration between physical hosts). Instead, Hyper-V on Server 2008 Enterprise and Datacenter Editions supports \\"quick migration\\", where a guest VM is suspended on one host and resumed on another host. This operation happens in the time it takes to transfer the active memory of the guest VM over the network from the first host to the second host.[45]\\r\\nHowever, with the release of Windows Server 2008 R2, live migration is supported with the use of Cluster Shared Volumes (CSVs). This allows for failover of an individual VM as opposed to the entire host having to failover (it seems that when a node (Hyper-V server, not a VM) fails then each \\"VM running on the failed node\\" may migrate to other live nodes independently of \\"other VMs on the same LUN running on other nodes that share the LUN with the failed node\\". In Hyper-V we are clustering the Hyper-V nodes not the VMs.). See also Cluster Shared Volumes.\\r\\nWindows Server 2012's implementation of Hyper-V (Version 3.0) introduced many new features to increase VM mobility, including the ability to execute simultaneous live migrations (Windows Server 2008 R2 only supported live migrating a single VM at a time, significantly increasing the time required to carry administrative tasks, such as draining a node for scheduled maintenance). The only real limiting factor here is hardware and network bandwidth available. Windows Server 2012 also supports a new \\"shared nothing live migration\\" option, where no traditional shared storage is required in order to complete a migration. Also referred to as Live System Migration, a shared nothing live migration will move a running VM and its storage from one Hyper-V host to another without any perceived downtime. Live Migration between different host OS versions is not possible, although this is soon to be addressed in Windows Server 2012 R2.\\r\\nWindows Server 2012 also introduced the ability to use simple SMB shares as a shared storage option (in conjunction with the new Scale out File Services role in Server 2012 for highly available environments), alleviating the need for expensive SANs. This is particularly useful for low budget environments, without the need to sacrifice performance due to the many new improvements to the SMB3 stack. Windows Server 2012 will fully support the live migration of VMs running on SMB shares, whether it be a live or live system migration.\\r\\nHyper-V under Windows Server 2012 also supports the ability to migrate a running VM's storage, whereby an active Virtual Machines storage can be moved from one infrastructure to another without the VM's workload being affected, further reducing the limitations associated with VM mobility.\\r\\nWith the introduction of Windows Server 2012 R2, SMB 3.0 was introduced as a transport option for Live Migration, either between clustered or non-clustered virtualization hosts. This enables Hyper-V Live Migration to leverage the additional benefits that SMB 3.0 brings, such as SMB Multichannel and SMB Direct (in conjunction with RDMA NICs) for increased Live Migration performance.\\r\\nWindows XP frequently accesses CPU's APIC task-priority register (TPR) when interrupt request level changes, causing a performance degradation when running as guests on Hyper-V.[46] Microsoft has fixed this problem in Windows Server 2003 and later.[46]\\r\\nIntel adds TPR virtualization (FlexPriority) to VT-x on Intel Core 2 stepping E onwards to alleviate this problem.[47] AMD has a similar feature on AMD-V but uses a new register for the purpose. This however means that the guest has to use different instructions to access this new register. AMD provides a driver called \\"AMD-V Optimization Driver\\" that has to be installed on the guest to do that.[48]\\r\\nNetwork card teaming or link aggregation isn't supported if the NIC manufacturer supplied drivers support NIC teaming.[49] However, Windows Server 2012 and thus the version of Hyper-V included with it supports software NIC teaming.[50]\\r\\nHyper-V management tools are not compatible with Windows Vista Home Basic or Home Premium[51][51] or Windows 7 Home Premium, Home Basic or Starter.\\r\\nHyper-V 2012 can only be managed by Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 or their successors.\\r\\nHyper-V uses the VT-x x86 virtualization. Since Hyper-V is a native hypervisor, as long as it is installed, third-party software cannot use VT-x. For instance, the HAXM Android device emulator (used by Android Studio or Microsoft Visual Studio) cannot run while Hyper-V is installed.[52]\\r\\n64-bit SKUs of Windows 8 Pro or Enterprise, or later, come with a special version Hyper-V called Client Hyper-V.[53]\\r\\nWindows Server 2012 introduced many new features in Hyper-V.[6]\\r\\nWith Windows Server 2012 R2 Microsoft introduced another set of new features.[58]\\r\\nHyper-V in Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 adds[64]","input":"What was the first os to support microsoft hyper-v?"},{"output":"Brian Kelly","context":"This is a list of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football head coaches.

Now commonly called \\"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\\", the original printed music calls it \\"It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary\\". It became popular among soldiers in the First World War and is remembered as a song of that war.\\r\\n\\r\\nWelcoming signs in the referenced county of Tipperary, Ireland, humorously declare, \\"You've come a long long way...\\" in reference to the song.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the First World War, Daily Mail correspondent George Curnock saw the Irish regiment the Connaught Rangers singing this song as they marched through Boulogne on 13 August 1914 and reported it on 18 August 1914. The song was quickly picked up by other units of the British Army. In November 1914, it was recorded by Irish tenor John McCormack, which helped its worldwide popularity.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most popular hits of the time, the song is atypical in that it is not a warlike song that incites the soldiers to glorious deeds. Popular songs in previous wars (such as the Boer Wars) frequently did this. In the First World War, however, the most popular songs, like this one and \\"Keep the Home Fires Burning\\", concentrated on the longing for home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis song is not to be confused with a popular song from 1907 simply titled \\"Tipperary\\". Both were sung at different times by early recording star Billy Murray. Murray, with the American Quartet, sang \\"It's A Long Way To Tipperary\\" as a straightforward march, complete with brass, drums and cymbals, with a quick bar of \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" thrown into the instrumental interlude between the first and second verse-chorus combination.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nJack Judge's parents were Irish, and his grandparents came from Tipperary.[4] Judge and Harry Williams met in Oldbury, Worcestershire at the Malt Shovel, where Williams's brother Ben was the licensee. Judge and Williams began a long-term writing partnership that resulted in 32 music hall songs published by Feldmans. Williams was severely handicapped, having fallen down cellar steps as a child. His parents were publicans (proprietors of pubs) and many of the songs were believed to have been composed with Judge at their home, The Plough Inn (now The Tipperary Inn), in Balsall Common.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Harry Williams' death in 1924 Jack Judge claimed sole credit for the song,[5] allegedly writing it for a 5-shilling bet in Stalybridge on 30 January 1912 and performing it the next night at the local music hall. However, the tune and most of the lyrics to the song already existed in the form of a manuscript, \\"It's A Long Way to Connemara\\". This manuscript was co-written by Williams and Judge. The writing partners split the royalties for \\"It's a Long, Long, Way to Tipperary\\" until Jack Judge sold his royalties to Harry Williams in 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1917, Alice Smyth Burton Jay sued song publishers Chappell & Co. for $100,000, alleging she wrote the tune in 1908 for a song played at the AlaskaÿYukonÿPacific Exposition promoting the Washington apple industry. The chorus began \\"I'm on my way to Yakima\\".[6] The court appointed Victor Herbert to act as expert advisor[7] and dismissed the suit in 1920, since the authors of \\"Tipperary\\" had never been to Seattle and Victor Herbert testified the two songs were not similar enough to suggest plagiarism.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams' family got together in 2012 to have Harry Williams officially re-credited with the song.  They shared their archives with the Imperial War Museums.  The family estate still receives royalties from the song.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst sung on the British music hall stage in 1912[10] by Jack Judge at the Grand Theatre in Stalybridge and later popularised by the music hall star Florrie Forde, it was featured as one of the songs in the 1951 film On Moonlight Bay, the 1960s stage musical and film Oh! What a Lovely War and the 1970 musical Darling Lili, sung by Julie Andrews. It was also sung by the prisoners of war in Jean Renoir's film La Grande Illusion (1937) and as background music in The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming (1966). It is also the second part (the other two being Hanging on the Old Barbed Wire and Mademoiselle from Armentires) of the regimental march of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. Mystery Science Theater 3000 used it twice, sung by Crow T. Robot in Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie (1996), then sung again for the final television episode. It is also sung by British soldiers in the film The Travelling Players (1975) directed by the Theo Angelopoulos, and by Czechoslovak soldiers in the movie ?ern baroni (1992).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song is often cited when documentary footage of the First World War is presented. One example of its use is in the annual television special It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966). Snoopywho fancies himself as a First World War flying acedances to a medley of First World War-era songs played by Schroeder. This song is included, and at that point Snoopy falls into a left-right-left marching pace. Schroeder also played this song in Snoopy, Come Home (1972) at Snoopy's send-off party. Also, Snoopy was seen singing the song out loud in a series of strips about his going to the 1968 Winter Olympics. In another strip, Snoopy is walking so long a distance to Tipperary that he lies down exhausted and notes, \\"They're right, it is a long way to Tipperary.\\" On a different occasion, Snoopy walks along and begins to sing the song, only to meet a sign that reads, \\"Tipperary: One Block.\\" In a Sunday strip wherein Snoopy, in his World War I fantasy state, walks into Marcie's home, thinking it a French caf, and falls asleep after drinking all her root beer, she rousts him awake by loudly singing the song.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also featured in For Me and My Gal (1942) starring Judy Garland and Gene Kelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast of The Mary Tyler Moore Show march off screen singing the song at the conclusion of the series final episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was sung by the crew of U-96 in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 film Das Boot (that particular arrangement was performed by the Red Army Choir). Morale is boosted in the submarine when the German crew sings the song as they begin patrolling in the North Atlantic Ocean. The crew sings it a second time as they cruise toward home port after near disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the hellship Lisbon Maru was sinking, the Royal Artillery POWS trapped in the vessel are reported to have sung this song.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to mighty London\\r\\nCame an Irishman one day.\\r\\nAs the streets are paved with gold\\r\\nSure, everyone was gay,\\r\\nSinging songs of Piccadilly,\\r\\nStrand and Leicester Square,\\r\\nTill Paddy got excited,\\r\\nThen he shouted to them there:\\r\\n\\r\\nChorus\\r\\nIt's a long way to Tipperary,\\r\\nIt's a long way to go.\\r\\nIt's a long way to Tipperary,\\r\\nTo the sweetest girl I know!\\r\\nGoodbye, Piccadilly,\\r\\nFarewell, Leicester Square!\\r\\nIt's a long long way to Tipperary,\\r\\nBut my heart's right there.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaddy wrote a letter\\r\\nTo his Irish Molly-O,\\r\\nSaying, \\"Should you not receive it,\\r\\nWrite and let me know!\\"\\r\\n\\"If I make mistakes in spelling,\\r\\nMolly, dear,\\" said he,\\r\\n\\"Remember, it's the pen that's bad,\\r\\nDon't lay the blame on me!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChorus\\r\\n\\r\\nMolly wrote a neat reply\\r\\nTo Irish Paddy-O,\\r\\nSaying \\"Mike Maloney\\r\\nWants to marry me, and so\\r\\nLeave the Strand and Piccadilly\\r\\nOr you'll be to blame,\\r\\nFor love has fairly drove me silly:\\r\\nHoping you're the same!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChorus\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative bawdy concluding chorus:\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's the wrong way to tickle Mary,\\r\\nThat's the wrong way to kiss.\\r\\nDon't you know that over here, lad\\r\\nThey like it best like this.\\r\\nHoo-ray pour les fran?ais,\\r\\nFarewell Angleterre.\\r\\nWe didn't know how to tickle Mary,\\r\\nBut we learnt how over there.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Sheet Music for \\"It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary\\", Chappell & Co., Ltd., 1912.","input":"It's a long way to tipperary origin?"},{"output":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland","context":"The Entente Cordiale (French pronunciation:??[?t?t k??djal]) was a series of agreements signed on 8 April 1904 between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the French Third Republic which saw a significant improvement in Anglo-French relations.[1] Beyond the immediate concerns of colonial expansion addressed by the agreement, the signing of the Entente Cordiale marked the end of almost a thousand years of intermittent conflict between the two states and their predecessors, and replaced the modus vivendi that had existed since the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 with a more formal agreement.[2] The Entente Cordiale was the culmination of the policy of Thophile Delcass, France's foreign minister from 1898, who believed that a Franco-British understanding would give France some security against any German system of alliances in Western Europe. Credit for the success of the negotiation belongs chiefly to Paul Cambon, France's ambassador in London, and to the British foreign secretary Lord Lansdowne.\\r\\nThe most important feature of the agreement was that it granted freedom of action to the UK in Egypt and to France in Morocco (with the proviso that France's eventual dispositions for Morocco include reasonable allowance for Spain's interests there). At the same time, the UK ceded the Los Islands (off French Guinea) to France, defined the frontier of Nigeria in France's favour, and agreed to French control of the upper Gambia valley, while France renounced its exclusive right to certain fisheries off Newfoundland. Furthermore, French and British zones of influence in the not to be colonialized Siam (Thailand) were outlined, with the eastern territories, adjacent to French Indochina, becoming a French zone, and the western, adjacent to Burmese Tenasserim, a British zone. Arrangements were also made to allay the rivalry between British and French colonists in the New Hebrides.\\r\\nBy the Entente Cordiale both powers reduced the virtual isolation into which they had withdrawnFrance involuntarily, the UK complacentlywhile they had eyed each other over African affairs. The UK had no ally but Japan (1902), of little use if war should break out in European waters; France had none but Russia, soon to be discredited in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904ÿ05. The agreement was upsetting to Germany, whose policy had long been to rely on Franco-British antagonism. A German attempt to check the French in Morocco in 1905 (the Tangier Incident, or First Moroccan Crisis), and thus upset the Entente, served only to strengthen it. Military discussions between the French and the British general staffs were soon initiated. Franco-British solidarity was confirmed at the Algeciras Conference (1906) and reconfirmed in the Second Moroccan Crisis (1911).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French term Entente Cordiale (usually translated as \\"cordial agreement\\" or \\"cordial understanding\\") comes from a letter written in 1843 by the British Foreign Secretary Lord Aberdeen to his brother, in which he mentioned \\"a cordial, good understanding\\" between the two nations. This was translated into French as Entente Cordiale and used by Louis Philippe I in the French Chamber that year.[4] When used today the term almost always denotes the second Entente Cordiale, that is to say, the written and partly secret agreement signed in London between the two powers on 8 April 1904.\\r\\nThe agreement was a change for both countries. France had been isolated from the other European powers, mostly as a result of the efforts of German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck to estrange France from potential allies, as it was thought that France might seek revenge for its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870ÿ71. The United Kingdom had maintained a policy of \\"splendid isolation\\" on the European continent for nearly a century, intervening in continental affairs only when it was considered necessary to protect British interests and to maintain the continental balance of power. The situation for both countries changed in the last decade of the 19th century.[5]\\r\\nThe change had its roots in a British loss of confidence after the Second Boer War, and a growing fear that the country was isolated in the face of a potentially aggressive Germany. As early as March 1881, the French statesman Lon Gambetta and the then-Prince of Wales, Albert Edward, met at the Chateau de Breteuil to discuss an alliance against Germany. The Scramble for Africa prevented the countries from coming to terms, however. On the initiative of Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain, there were three rounds of British-German talks between 1898 and 1901. The UK decided not to join the Triple Alliance, broke off the negotiations with Berlin, and revived the idea of a British-French alliance.[6]\\r\\nWhen the Russo-Japanese War was about to erupt, France and the UK found themselves on the verge of being dragged into the conflict on the side of their respective allies. France was firmly allied with Russia, while the UK had recently signed the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. In order to avoid going to war, both powers \\"shucked off their ancient rivalry\\"[7] and resolved their differences in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific. Toward this end, French foreign minister Thophile Delcass, and Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary, negotiated an agreement on colonial matters, and Lord Lansdowne and Paul Cambon, the French Ambassador to the UK, signed the resulting convention on 8 April 1904.[8]\\r\\nThe Entente was composed of three documents:\\r\\nIt is unclear what exactly the Entente meant to the British Foreign Office. For example, in early 1911 following French press reports contrasting the virility of the Triple Alliance with the moribund state of the Entente Eyre Crowe minuted: \\"The fundamental fact of course is that the Entente is not an alliance. For purposes of ultimate emergencies it may be found to have no substance at all. For the Entente is nothing more than a frame of mind, a view of general policy which is shared by the governments of two countries, but which may be, or become, so vague as to lose all content.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe Triple Alliance collapsed when Italy remained neutral at the outbreak of World War I, while the Entente endured.\\r\\nThe hundredth anniversary of the Entente cordiale in 2004 was marked by a number of official and unofficial events, including a state visit to France in April by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, and a return visit by President Chirac in November. British troops (the band of the Royal Marines, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, Grenadier Guards and King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery) also led the Bastille Day parade in Paris for the first time, with the Red Arrows flying overhead.\\r\\nAt both London Waterloo International and Paris Gare du Nord, the flags of the United Kingdom and of France were depicted connected with the words 'Entente cordiale' superimposed on posters. Some French political leaders had complained[10] about the name \\"Waterloo\\" for the destination of trains from Paris because the British terminus is named after the 1815 battle where a British-led alliance defeated Napoleon's army, and in 1998 French politician Florent Longuepe wrote to British Prime Minister Tony Blair demanding, without success, that the name be changed.[10][11] In November 2007 St Pancras International became the new London terminus for the Eurostar service.\\r\\nThe name \\"Entente Cordiale\\" is used for the Entente Cordiale Scholarship scheme, a selective Franco-British scholarship scheme which was announced on 30 October 1995 by British Prime Minister John Major and French President Jacques Chirac at an Anglo-French summit in London.[12] It provides funding for British and French students to study for one academic year on the other side of the Channel. The scheme is administered by the French embassy in London for British students,[13] and by the British Council France and the UK embassy in Paris for French students.[14][15] Funding is provided by the private sector and foundations. The scheme aims to foster mutual understanding and to promote exchanges between the British and French leaders of tomorrow.

They are entered in the family register of their place of origin. One's place of origin depends on how one has acquired Swiss nationality. Nationals who are naturalised take the nationality of the municipality in which they were naturalised; citizens who became Swiss by virtue of their parents or of their marriage to a Swiss national, take the municipality of their father or spouse. It is not to be confused with the place of birth, which may be different.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA child is Swiss at birth if:\\r\\nA child of a Swiss father not married to the mother is considered Swiss by birth when a link of paternity is declared.[3][4]\\r\\nA foundling acquires Swiss citizenship and the citizenship of the canton in which s/he was found. The canton decides which bourgeoisie the child receives. Once paternity is determined, the child loses Swiss citizenship, unless this would leave him or her stateless.[5]\\r\\nA child adopted by a Swiss parent acquires the cantonal citizenship and bourgeoisie of the Swiss parent, thus equally acquiring Swiss nationality.[6]\\r\\nOn 20 June 2014, the two Chambers of the Swiss Parliament passed the Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality (Rvision totale de la loi sur l'acquisition et la perte de la nationalit suisse). The Law, first introduced in 2011 by the Swiss federal government, aimed to lower, among other requirements, the residency requirement from 12 years to 8 years.[7] During the parliamentary debates and the ensuing disagreements between the more conservative National Council (lower house) and the more liberal Council of States (upper house), the residency requirements were increased to 10 years. The time spent in Switzerland between the ages of 8 and 18 is doubled for purposes of applying for naturalisation, however, an applicant must spend at least 6 years in Switzerland.[8] The new law also requires cantons to set a minimum residency requirement of between 2 and 5 years, as well as requiring applicants to have a permanent residency permit (Autorisation d'tablissement), which is known as a C permit.[9][10] Additionally, time spent in Switzerland with temporary admission (Permis d'admission provisoire) halved for purposes of applying for naturalisation.[11] The 2014 Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality is scheduled to enter into force on 1 January 2018.[12]\\r\\nThe 1952 nationality law is scheduled to be replaced by the 2014 total revision of the nationality law on 1 January 2018. Applications for naturalisation submitted prior to the entry into force of the new nationality law will continue to be processed under the 1952 law. [13] Ordinary naturalisation is a cantonal competency, however no cantonal naturalisation is legally valid without federal authorisation.[14]\\r\\nCitizenship in Switzerland may be obtained by a resident who has lived in Switzerland for at least 12 years (any years spent in Switzerland between the 10th and the 20th years of age count double) and lived in the country for 3 out of the last 5 years before applying for citizenship. One should be able to speak in at least one of German, French, Italian or Romansch (depending on the canton or municipality) and show the following:\\r\\nCantons impose further requirements which can complement the federal requirements.\\r\\nForeigners in the following categories may apply for simplified naturalisation:\\r\\nAll these categories have additional requirements to be fulfilled. Normally, a successful applicant acquires the cantonal and municipal citizenship of the Swiss mother, father, or spouse.\\r\\nA person married to a Swiss citizen may apply for Swiss citizenship by facilitated naturalisation after living in Switzerland for five years and having been married for at least three years. No language test is required, but one must show the following:\\r\\nChildren from the person's previous relationships (but not same-sex couples) are given citizenship along with the partner.\\r\\nIt is also possible for the spouse of a Swiss citizen to apply for facilitated naturalisation while resident overseas after the following:\\r\\nSpouses acquiring Swiss citizenship by facilitated naturalisation will acquire the citizenship of the place and canton of origin of their Swiss spouse.\\r\\nThe federal constitution declares that the Confederation will facilitate the naturalisation of third generation immigrants (Art. 38 3 part a). Legislation has yet to be introduced describing the precise requirements for an application for facilitated naturalisation under article 38 3 part a.\\r\\nThe Canton of Vaud legislated in 2004 to allow for 2nd-generation foreigners to acquire Swiss nationality more easily under the following conditions:[15]\\r\\nThe 2004 Law also facilitates the naturalisation of foreigners of the 3rd generation under the following conditions:[16]\\r\\nThe yearly rate of naturalisation has quintupled over the 1990s and 2000s, from roughly 9,000 to 45,000 naturalisations per year.\\r\\nRelative to the population of resident foreigners, this amounts to an increase from 8% in 1990 to 27% in 2007, or relative to the number of Swiss citizens from 0.16% in 1990 to 0.73% in 2007.\\r\\nA child whose Swiss citizenship depends on paternal links loses citizenship when those are cut.[17]\\r\\nA Swiss child adopted by foreign parents is considered to have lost Swiss citizenship.[18]\\r\\nWhere a former Swiss citizen lost citizenship due to adoption by foreign parents and that adoption is later annulled, the Swiss citizenship is considered to never have been lost.[19]\\r\\nA Swiss citizen born abroad to at least one Swiss parent and holding at least one other nationality loses Swiss citizenship at age 22 if:\\r\\nEqually, the child of a person who thus loses Swiss nationality equally loses Swiss nationality.[23] Exceptionally, a person who has been prevented, against their will, from taking the necessary actions to retain Swiss citizenship may undertake the required actions within a delay of 1 year following the cessation of such delays.[24]\\r\\nEach municipality in Switzerland maintains its own registry of citizens, which is separate from the registry of people living in the municipality. Most Swiss citizens do not live in their municipality of origin; therefore, they are often required by the municipality in which they live to get a certificate of citizenship (acte d'origine/Heimatschein/atto d'origine) from their place of origin. In practice, there is no difference in rights or obligations between citizens of different municipalities, except for the extra paperwork that may be involved.\\r\\nAccording to the Federal Office for Migration, there has been no restriction on multiple citizenship in Switzerland since 1 January 1992. Thus, foreigners who acquire Swiss citizenship and Swiss citizens who voluntarily acquire another citizenship keep their previous citizenship (subject to the laws of the other country), as was the case before this date. An estimated 60% of Swiss nationals living abroad in 1998 were multiple citizens.\\r\\nSince many nationality laws now allow both parents to transmit their nationality to their common child (and not only the father, as used to be often the case), many children automatically acquire multiple citizenship at birth. This is especially frequent in Switzerland, since a relatively high proportion of the population holds a foreign passport (up to 54% in Geneva and 20% nationally). However, the Federal Office for Migration specially notes that this has not resulted in any practical problems worth mentioning. Military service, the most likely problem to arise, is usually done in the country where the applicant resides at the time of conscription.\\r\\nEven though Swiss nationality law permits multiple citizenship, a Swiss national who also holds another country's citizenship may be required to renounce the foreign citizenship, under the foreign country's nationality law.\\r\\nAfter two referendums rejected laws to facilitate naturalisation in September 2004, some opponents (notably the Swiss People's Party) attempted to go back to the pre-1992 situation, in which multiple citizenship was forbidden.\\r\\nSwiss citizenship laws have been widely debated over recent years. In comparison to other nationality laws, access to Swiss citizenship is relatively narrow and restricted, and several modifications to widen access to Swiss citizenship via constitutional initiatives and referendums have been proposed. The referendums on the matter ÿ held in 1983, 1994 and 2004 ÿ were all rejected by Swiss voters. In particular, during the referendum held in September 2004, Swiss voters rejected proposals [25] to give some long-resident Swiss-born persons aged between 14 and 24 the right to apply for facilitated naturalisation (which bypasses cantonal and municipal requirements) and grant automatic Swiss citizenship to persons born in Switzerland with a parent also born in Switzerland.\\r\\nWhile minimal requirements for obtaining Swiss citizenship by naturalisation are set at the federal level, Swiss cantons and municipalities are free to introduce more stringent requirements. Some municipalities had previously had no procedure for allowing naturalisations, effectively rendering it impossible, such as in La Chaux in the Canton of Vaud.[26] In 1999, the municipality of Emmen and the canton of Lucerne began using referendums to decide the outcome of naturalisation requests. The practice was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in July 2003. A referendum directed at legalizing this practice was rejected on 1 June 2008.\\r\\nSwiss citizens are entitled to\\r\\nVisa requirements for Swiss citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Switzerland.

It is believed to have first appeared about 60 million years ago.[2]\\r\\nFrom July to September 2011, the Canarian island of El Hierro experienced thousands of small tremors, believed to be the result of magma movements beneath the island. This resulted in fears of an imminent volcanic eruption, which began October 10, 2011, approximately 1?km south of the island in a fissure on the floor of the ocean and is continuing with the possibility that a new island will form or an existing island become larger.[3]\\r\\nSee also 2011ÿ12 El Hierro eruption.","input":"What is the approximate location of the canary island hotspot?"},{"output":"carbon dioxide","context":"The atmosphere of Venus is the layer of gases surrounding Venus. It is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and is much denser and hotter than that of Earth. The temperature at the surface is 740?K (467?C, 872?F), and the pressure is 93?bar (9.3?MPa), roughly the pressure found 900?m (3,000?ft) underwater on Earth.[1] The Venusian atmosphere supports opaque clouds made of sulfuric acid, making optical Earth-based and orbital observation of the surface impossible. Information about the topography has been obtained exclusively by radar imaging.[1] Aside from carbon dioxide, the other main component is nitrogen. Other chemical compounds are present only in trace amounts.[1]\\r\\nMikhail Lomonosov was the first person to hypothesize the existence of an atmosphere on Venus based on his observation of the transit of Venus of 1761 in a small observatory near his house in Saint Petersburg, Russia.[3]\\r\\nAside from the very surface layers, the atmosphere is in a state of vigorous circulation.[4] The upper layer of troposphere exhibits a phenomenon of super-rotation, in which the atmosphere circles the planet in just four Earth days, much faster than the planet's sidereal day of 243 days. The winds supporting super-rotation blow at a speed of 100?m/s (~360?km/h or 220?mph)[4] or more. Winds move at up to 60 times the speed of the planet's rotation, while Earth's fastest winds are only 10% to 20% rotation speed.[5] On the other hand, the wind speed becomes increasingly slower as the elevation from the surface decreases, with the breeze barely reaching the speed of 10?km/h (2.8?m/s) on the surface.[6] Near the poles are anticyclonic structures called polar vortices. Each vortex is double-eyed and shows a characteristic S-shaped pattern of clouds.[7] Above there is an intermediate layer of mesosphere which separates the troposphere from the thermosphere.[4][2] The thermosphere is also characterized by strong circulation, but very different in its nature - the gases heated and partially ionized by sunlight in the sunlit hemisphere migrate to the dark hemisphere where they recombine and downwell.[2]\\r\\nUnlike Earth, Venus lacks a magnetic field. Its ionosphere separates the atmosphere from outer space and the solar wind. This ionised layer excludes the solar magnetic field, giving Venus a distinct magnetic environment. This is considered Venus's induced magnetosphere. Lighter gases, including water vapour, are continuously blown away by the solar wind through the induced magnetotail.[4] It is speculated that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4?billion years ago was more like that of the Earth with liquid water on the surface. A runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and subsequent rise of the levels of other greenhouse gases.[8][9]\\r\\nDespite the harsh conditions on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50?km to 65?km above the surface of the planet is nearly the same as that of the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus in the same way that helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.[10]\\r\\nOn January 29, 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of the planet Venus streams outwards in a manner similar to \\"the ion tail seen streaming from a comet under similar conditions.\\"[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atmosphere of Venus is composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide.[13] The amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere is relatively small compared to the amount of carbon dioxide, but because the atmosphere is so much thicker than that on Earth, its total nitrogen content is roughly four times higher than Earth's, even though on Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere.[1][14]\\r\\nThe atmosphere contains a range of interesting compounds in small quantities, including some based on hydrogen, such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). There is carbon monoxide, water vapour and atomic oxygen as well.[2][4] Hydrogen is in relatively short supply in the Venusian atmosphere. A large amount of the planet's hydrogen is theorised to have been lost to space,[15] with the remainder being mostly bound up in sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The loss of significant amounts of hydrogen is proven by a very high DÿH ratio measured in the Venusian atmosphere.[4] The ratio is about 0.015ÿ0.025, which is 100ÿ150 times higher than the terrestrial value of 1.6G10?4.[2][16] According to some measurements, in the upper atmosphere of Venus D/H ratio is 1.5 higher than in the bulk atmosphere.[2]\\r\\nThe atmosphere is divided into a number of sections depending on altitude. The densest part of the atmosphere, the troposphere, begins at the surface and extends upwards to 65?km. At the furnace-like surface the winds are slow,[1] but at the top of the troposphere the temperature and pressure reaches Earth-like levels and clouds pick up speed to 100?m/s.[4][17]\\r\\nThe atmospheric pressure at the surface of Venus is about 92 times that of the Earth, similar to the pressure found 900?m (3,000?ft) below the surface of the ocean. The atmosphere has a mass of 4.8G1020 kg, about 93 times the mass of the Earth's total atmosphere.[citation needed] The density of the air at the surface is 67?kg/m3, which is 6.5% that of liquid water on Earth.[1] The pressure found on Venus's surface is high enough that the carbon dioxide is technically no longer a gas, but a supercritical fluid. This supercritical carbon dioxide forms a kind of sea that covers the entire surface of Venus. This sea of supercritical carbon dioxide transfers heat very efficiently, buffering the temperature changes between night and day (which last 56 terrestrial days).[18]\\r\\nThe large amount of CO2 in the atmosphere together with water vapour and sulfur dioxide create a strong greenhouse effect, trapping solar energy and raising the surface temperature to around 740?K (467?C),[14] hotter than any other planet in the Solar System, even that of Mercury despite being located farther out from the Sun and receiving only 25% of the solar energy (per unit area) Mercury does.[citation needed] The average temperature on the surface is above the melting points of lead (600?K, 327?C), tin (505?K, 232?C), and zinc (693?K, 420?C). The thick troposphere also makes the difference in temperature between the day and night side small, even though the slow retrograde rotation of the planet causes a single solar day to last 116.5 Earth days. The surface of Venus spends 58.3 days of darkness before the sun rises again behind the clouds.[1]\\r\\nThe troposphere on Venus contains 99% of the atmosphere by mass. Ninety percent of the atmosphere of Venus is within 28?km of the surface; by comparison, 90% of the atmosphere of Earth is within 10?km of the surface. At a height of 50?km the atmospheric pressure is approximately equal to that at the surface of Earth.[20] On the night side of Venus clouds can still be found at 80?km above the surface.[21]\\r\\nThe altitude of the troposphere most similar to Earth is near the tropopausethe boundary between troposphere and mesosphere. It is located slightly above 50?km.[17] According to measurements by the Magellan and Venus Express probes, the altitude from 52.5 to 54?km has a temperature between 293?K (20?C) and 310?K (37?C), and the altitude at 49.5?km above the surface is where the pressure becomes the same as Earth at sea level.[17][22] As manned ships sent to Venus would be able to compensate for differences in temperature to a certain extent, anywhere from about 50 to 54?km or so above the surface would be the easiest altitude in which to base an exploration or colony, where the temperature would be in the crucial \\"liquid water\\" range of 273?K (0?C) to 323?K (50?C) and the air pressure the same as habitable regions of Earth.[10][23] As CO2 is heavier than air, the colony's air (nitrogen and oxygen) could keep the structure floating at that altitude like a dirigible.\\r\\nThe circulation in Venus's troposphere follows the so-called cyclostrophic approximation.[4] Its windspeeds are roughly determined by the balance of the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces in almost purely zonal flow. In contrast, the circulation in the Earth's atmosphere is governed by the geostrophic balance.[4] Venus's windspeeds can be directly measured only in the upper troposphere (tropopause), between 60ÿ70?km, altitude, which corresponds to the upper cloud deck.[24] The cloud motion is usually observed in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, where the contrast between clouds is the highest.[24] The linear wind speeds at this level are about 100?I?10?m/s at lower than 50 latitude. They are retrograde in the sense that they blow in the direction of the retrograde rotation of the planet.[24] The winds quickly decrease towards the higher latitudes, eventually reaching zero at the poles. Such strong cloud-top winds cause a phenomenon known as the super-rotation of the atmosphere.[4] In other words, these high-speed winds circle the whole planet faster than the planet itself rotates.[23] The super-rotation on Venus is differential, which means that the equatorial troposphere super-rotates more slowly than the troposphere at the midlatitudes.[24] The winds also have a strong vertical gradient. They decline deep in the troposphere with the rate of 3?m/s?per?km.[4] The winds near the surface of Venus are much slower than that on Earth. They actually move at only a few kilometres per hour (generally less than 2?m/s and with an average of 0.3 to 1.0?m/s), but due to the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, this is still enough to transport dust and small stones across the surface, much like a slow-moving current of water.[1][25]\\r\\nAll winds on Venus are ultimately driven by convection.[4] Hot air rises in the equatorial zone, where solar heating is concentrated, and flows to the poles. Such an almost-planetwide overturning of the troposphere is called Hadley circulation.[4] However, the meridional air motions are much slower than zonal winds. The poleward limit of the planet wide Hadley cell on Venus is near I60 latitudes.[4] Here air starts to descend and returns to the equator below the clouds. This interpretation is supported by the distribution of the carbon monoxide, which is also concentrated in the vicinity of I60 latitudes.[4] Poleward of the Hadley cell a different pattern of circulation is observed. In the latitude range 60ÿ70 cold polar collars exist.[4][7] They are characterised by temperatures about 30ÿ40?K lower than in the upper troposphere at nearby latitudes.[7] The lower temperature is probably caused by the upwelling of the air in them and by the resulting adiabatic cooling.[7] Such an interpretation is supported by the denser and higher clouds in the collars. The clouds lie at 70ÿ72?km altitude in the collarsabout 5?km higher than at the poles and low latitudes.[4] A connection may exist between the cold collars and high speed midlatitude jets in which winds blow as fast as 140?m/s. Such jets are a natural consequence of the Hadleyÿtype circulation and should exist on Venus between 55ÿ60 latitude.[24]\\r\\nOdd structures known as polar vortices lie within the cold polar collars.[4] They are giant hurricane-like storms four times larger than their terrestrial analogs. Each vortex has two \\"eyes\\"the centres of rotation, which are connected by distinct S-shaped cloud structures. Such double eyed structures are also called polar dipoles.[7] Vortices rotate with the period of about 3 days in the direction of general super-rotation of the atmosphere.[7] The linear wind speeds are 35ÿ50?m/s near their outer edges and zero at the poles.[7] The temperature at the cloud-tops in the each polar vortex is much higher than in the nearby polar collars reaching 250?K (?23?C).[7] The conventional interpretation of the polar vortices is that they are anticyclones with downwelling in the centre and upwelling in the cold polar collars.[7] This type of circulation resembles a winter polar anticyclonic vortex on Earth, especially the one found over Antarctica. The observations in the various infrared atmospheric windows indicate that the anticyclonic circulation observed near the poles penetrates as deep as to 50?km altitude, i.e. to the base of the clouds.[7] The polar upper troposphere and mesosphere are extremely dynamic; large bright clouds may appear and disappear over the space of a few hours. One such event was observed by Venus Express between 9 and 13 January 2007, when the south polar region became brighter by 30%.[24] This event was probably caused by an injection of sulfur dioxide into the mesosphere, which then condensed forming a bright haze.[24] The two eyes in the vortices have yet to be explained.[26]\\r\\nThe first vortex on Venus was discovered at the north pole by the Pioneer Venus mission in 1978.[27] A discovery of the second large 'double-eyed' vortex at the south pole of Venus was made in the summer of 2006 by Venus Express, which came with no surprise.[26]\\r\\nImages from the Akatsuki orbiter revealed something similar to jet stream winds in the low and middle cloud region, which extends from 45 to 60 kilometers in altitude. The wind speed maximized near the equator. In September 2017 JAXA scientists named this phenomenon 'Venusian equatorial jet'.[28]\\r\\nThe mesosphere of Venus extends from 65?km to 120?km in height, and the thermosphere begins at approximately 120?km, eventually reaching the upper limit of the atmosphere (exosphere) at about 220 to 350?km.[17] The exosphere is the altitude at which the atmosphere becomes collisionless.\\r\\nThe mesosphere of Venus can be divided into two layers: the lower one between 62ÿ73?km[29] and the upper one between 73ÿ95?km.[17] In the first layer the temperature is nearly constant at 230?K (?43?C). This layer coincides with the upper cloud deck. In the second layer temperature starts to decrease again reaching about 165?K (?108?C) at the altitude of 95?km, where mesopause begins.[17] It is the coldest part of the Venusian dayside atmosphere.[2] In the dayside mesopause, which serves as a boundary between the mesophere and thermosphere and is located between 95ÿ120?km, temperature increases to a constantabout 300ÿ400?K (27ÿ127?C)value prevalent in the thermosphere.[2] In contrast, the nightside Venusian thermosphere is the coldest place on Venus with temperature as low as 100?K (?173?C). It is even called a cryosphere.[2]\\r\\nThe circulation patterns in the upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus are completely different from those in the lower atmosphere.[2] At altitudes 90ÿ150?km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet, with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere. The downwelling over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air, which forms a warm layer in the nightside mesosphere at the altitudes 90ÿ120?km.[4][2] The temperature of this layer230?K (?43?C) is far higher than the typical temperature found in the nightside thermosphere100?K (?173?C).[2] The air circulated from the dayside also carries oxygen atoms, which after recombination form excited molecules of oxygen in the long-lived singlet state (1g), which then relax and emit infrared radiation at the wavelength 1.27?m. This radiation from the altitude range 90ÿ100?km is often observed from the ground and spacecraft.[30] The nightside upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus is also the source of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emissions of CO2 and nitric oxide molecules, which are responsible for the low temperature of the nightside thermosphere.[30]\\r\\nThe Venus Express probe has shown through stellar occultation that the atmospheric haze extends much further up on the night side than the day side. On the day side the cloud deck has a thickness of 20?km and extends up to about 65?km, whereas on the night side the cloud deck in the form of a thick haze reaches up to 90?km in altitudewell into mesosphere, continuing even further to 105?km as a more transparent haze.[21] In 2011, the spacecraft discovered that Venus has a thin ozone layer at an altitude of 100?km.[31]\\r\\nVenus has an extended ionosphere located at altitudes 120ÿ300?km.[17] The ionosphere almost coincides with the thermosphere. The high levels of the ionization are maintained only over the dayside of the planet. Over the nightside the concentration of the electrons is almost zero.[17] The ionosphere of Venus consists of three layers: v1 between 120 and 130?km, v2 between 140 and 160?km and v3 between 200 and 250?km.[17] There may be an additional layer near 180?km. The maximum electron volume density (number of electrons in a unit of volume) 3G1011?m?3 is reached in the v2 layer near the subsolar point.[17] The upper boundary of the ionosphereionopause is located at altitudes 220ÿ375?km and separates the plasma of the planetary origin from that of the induced magnetosphere.[32][33] The main ionic species in the v1 and v2 layers is O2+ ion, whereas the v3 layer consists of O+ ions.[17] The ionospheric plasma is observed to be in motion; solar photoionization on the dayside, and ion recombination on the nightside, are the processes mainly responsible for accelerating the plasma to the observed velocities. The plasma flow appears to be sufficient to maintain the nightside ionosphere at or near the observed median level of ion densities.[34]\\r\\nVenus is known not to have a magnetic field.[32][33] The reason for its absence is not clear, but is probably related to the planet's slow rotation or the lack of convection in the mantle. Venus only has an induced magnetosphere formed by the Sun's magnetic field carried by the solar wind.[32] This process can be understood as the field lines wrapping around an obstacleVenus in this case. The induced magnetosphere of Venus has a bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause and magnetotail with the current sheet.[32][33]\\r\\nAt the subsolar point the bow shock stands 1900?km (0.3 Rv, where Rv is the radius of Venus) above the surface of Venus. This distance was measured in 2007 near the solar activity minimum.[33] Near the solar activity maximum it can be several times further from the planet.[32] The magnetopause is located at the altitude of 300?km.[33] The upper boundary of the ionosphere (ionopause) is near 250?km. Between the magnetopause and ionopause there exists a magnetic barriera local enhancement of the magnetic field, which prevents solar plasma from penetrating deeper into the Venusian atmosphere, at least near solar activity minimum. The magnetic field in the barrier reaches up to 40?nT.[33] The magnetotail continues up to ten radiuses from the planet. It is the most active part of the Venusian magnetosphere. There are reconnection events and particle acceleration in the tail. The energies of electrons and ions in the magnetotail are around 100?eV and 1000?eV respectively.[35]\\r\\nDue to the lack of the intrinsic magnetic field on Venus, the solar wind penetrates relatively deep into the planetary exosphere and causes substantial atmosphere loss.[36] The loss happens mainly via the magnetotail. Currently the main ion types being lost are O+, H+ and He+. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen losses is around 2 (i.e. almost stoichiometric) indicating the ongoing loss of water.[35]\\r\\nVenusian clouds are thick and are composed mainly (75-96%) of sulfuric acid droplets.[37] These clouds obscure the surface of Venus from optical imaging, and reflect about 75%[38] of the sunlight that falls on them.[1] The geometric albedo, a common measure of reflectivity, is the highest of any planet in the Solar System. This high reflectivity potentially enables any probe exploring the cloud tops sufficient solar energy such that solar cells can be fitted anywhere on the craft.[39] The density of the clouds is highly variable with the densest layer at about 48.5?km, reaching 0.1 g/m3 similar to the lower range of cumulonimbus storm clouds on Earth.[40]\\r\\nThe cloud cover is such that typical surface light levels are similar to a partly cloudy day on Earth, around 5000ÿ10000 lux. The equivalent visibility is about three kilometers, but this will likely vary with the wind conditions. Little to no solar energy could conceivably be collected by solar panels on a surface probe. In fact, due to the thick, highly reflective cloud cover, the total solar energy received by the surface of the planet is less than that of the Earth.\\r\\nSulfuric acid is produced in the upper atmosphere by the Sun's photochemical action on carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water vapour.[41] Ultraviolet photons of wavelengths less than 169 nm can photodissociate carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen. Atomic oxygen is highly reactive; when it reacts with sulfur dioxide, a trace component of the Venusian atmosphere, the result is sulfur trioxide, which can combine with water vapour, another trace component of Venus's atmosphere, to yield sulfuric acid.\\r\\nSurface level humidity is less than 0.1%.[42] Venus's sulfuric acid rain never reaches the ground, but is evaporated by the heat before reaching the surface in a phenomenon known as virga.[43] It is theorized that early volcanic activity released sulfur into the atmosphere and the high temperatures prevented it from being trapped into solid compounds on the surface as it was on the Earth.[44]\\r\\nIn 2009 a prominent bright spot in the atmosphere was noted by an amateur astronomer and photographed by Venus Express. Its cause is currently unknown, with surface volcanism advanced as a possible explanation.[45]\\r\\nThe clouds of Venus are capable of producing lightning much like the clouds on Earth.[46] The existence of lightning had been controversial outside of the former Soviet Union since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes. However, in 2006ÿ2007 Venus Express was reported to detect whistler mode waves, which were attributed to lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. The lightning rate is at least half of that on Earth.[46]\\r\\nThe sulfuric acid droplets can be highly electrically charged, and so they offer the potential for lightning.[41] Venus' small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation. This radiation may result in cloud-to-cloud lightning discharges.[47]\\r\\nThroughout the 1980s, it was thought that the cause of the glow was lightning on Venus.[48] The Soviet Venera 9 and 10 orbiters obtained optical and electromagnetic evidence of lightning on Venus.[49]\\r\\n[50] Also, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter recorded visible airglow at Venus in 1978 strong enough to saturate its star sensor.[49] The European Space Agency's Venus Express in 2007 detected whistler waves further confirming the occurrence of lightning on Venus.[51][52]\\r\\nDue to the harsh conditions on the surface, little of the planet has been explored; in addition to the fact that life as currently understood may not necessarily be the same in other parts of the universe, the extent of the tenacity of life on Earth itself has not yet been shown. Creatures known as extremophiles exist on Earth, preferring extreme habitats. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles thrive at temperatures reaching above the boiling point of water, acidophiles thrive at a pH level of 3 or below, polyextremophiles can survive a varied number of extreme conditions, and many other types of extremophiles exist on Earth.[53]\\r\\nThe surface temperature of Venus (over 450?C) is far beyond the extremophile range, which extends only tens of degrees beyond 100?C. However, the lower temperature of the cloud tops means that life could plausibly exist. It has been proposed that life on Venus could exist there, the same way that bacteria have been found living and reproducing in clouds on Earth.[54] Any such bacteria living in the cloud tops, however, would have to be hyper-acidiphilic, due to the concentrated sulfuric acid environment. Microbes in the thick, cloudy atmosphere could be protected from solar radiation by the sulfur compounds in the air.[53] The solar wind may provide a mechanism for the transfer of such microbiota from Venus to Earth.[55]\\r\\nThe Venusian atmosphere has been found to be sufficiently out of equilibrium as to require further investigation.[53] Analysis of data from the Venera, Pioneer, and Magellan missions has found the chemicals hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) together in the upper atmosphere, as well as carbonyl sulfide (OCS). The first two gases react with each other, implying that something must produce them. Carbonyl sulfide is difficult to produce inorganically, but it is present in the Venusian atmosphere.[54] However, the planet's volcanism could explain the presence of carbonyl sulfide.[54] In addition, one of the early Venera probes detected large amounts of toxic chlorine just below the Venusian cloud deck.[56]\\r\\nIt has been proposed that microbes at this level could be soaking up ultraviolet light from the Sun as a source of energy, which could be a possible explanation for dark patches seen on UV images of the planet.[57][58] Large, non-spherical cloud particles have also been detected in the cloud decks. In 2012, the abundance and vertical distribution of these unknown ultraviolet absorbers in the Venusian atmosphere have been investigated from analysis of Venus Monitoring Camera images,[59] but their composition is still unknown.[53] In 2016, disulfur dioxide has been identified as a possible candidate for causing the so far unknown UV absorption of the Venusian atmosphere.[60]\\r\\nThrough studies of the present cloud structure and geology of the surface, combined with the fact that the luminosity of the Sun has increased by 25% since around 3.8?billion years ago,[61] it is thought that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4?billion years ago was more like that of Earth with liquid water on the surface. The runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and the rise of the levels of greenhouse gases that followed. Venus's atmosphere has therefore received a great deal of attention from those studying climate change on Earth.[8]\\r\\nThere are no geologic forms on the planet to suggest the presence of water over the past billion years. However, there is no reason to suppose that Venus was an exception to the processes that formed Earth and gave it its water during its early history, possibly from the original rocks that formed the planet or later on from comets. The common view among research scientists is that water would have existed for about 600?million years on the surface before evaporating, though some such as David Grinspoon believe that up to 2?billion years could also be plausible.[62]\\r\\nThe early Earth during the Hadean eon is believed by most scientists to have had a Venus-like atmosphere, with roughly 100 bar of CO2 and a surface temperature of 230?C, and possibly even sulfuric acid clouds, until about 4.0?billion years ago, by which time plate tectonics were in full force and together with the early water oceans, removed the CO2 and sulfur from the atmosphere.[63] Early Venus would thus most likely have had water oceans like the Earth, but any plate tectonics would have ended when Venus lost its oceans[citation needed]. Its surface is estimated to be about 500?million years old, so it would not be expected to show evidence of plate tectonics.[64]\\r\\nIn 1761, Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov observed an arc of light surrounding the part of Venus off the Sun's disc at the beginning of the egress phase of the transit and concluded that Venus has an atmosphere.[65][66] In 1940, Rupert Wildt calculated that the amount of CO2 in the Venusian atmosphere would raise surface temperature above the boiling point for water.[67] This was confirmed when Mariner 2 made radiometer measurements of the temperature in 1962. In 1967, Venera 4 confirmed that the atmosphere consisted primarily of carbon dioxide.[67]\\r\\nThe upper atmosphere of Venus can be measured from Earth when the planet crosses the sun in a rare event known as a solar transit. The last solar transit of Venus occurred in 2012. Using quantitative astronomical spectroscopy, scientists were able to analyse sunlight that passed through the planet's atmosphere to reveal chemicals within it. As the technique to analyse light to discover information about a planet's atmosphere only first showed results in 2001,[68] this was the first opportunity to gain conclusive results in this way on the atmosphere of Venus since observation of solar transits began. This solar transit was a rare opportunity considering the lack of information on the atmosphere between 65 and 85?km.[69] The solar transit in 2004 enabled astronomers to gather a large amount of data useful not only in determining the composition of the upper atmosphere of Venus, but also in refining techniques used in searching for extrasolar planets. The atmosphere of mostly CO2, absorbs near-infrared radiation, making it easy to observe. During the 2004 transit, the absorption in the atmosphere as a function of wavelength revealed the properties of the gases at that altitude. The Doppler shift of the gases also enabled wind patterns to be measured.[70]\\r\\nA solar transit of Venus is an extremely rare event, and the last solar transit of the planet before 2004 was in 1882. The most recent solar transit was in 2012; the next one will not occur until 2117.[69][70]\\r\\nThe Venus Express spacecraft formerly in orbit around the planet probed deeper into the atmosphere using infrared imaging spectroscopy in the 1ÿ5?m spectral range.[4]\\r\\nThe JAXA probe Akatsuki, launched in May 2010, was intended to study the planet for a period of two years, including the structure and activity of the atmosphere, but it failed to enter Venus orbit in December 2010. A second attempt to achieve orbit succeeded 7 December 2015.[71] One of its five cameras known as the \\"IR2\\" will be able to measure the atmosphere of the planet underneath its thick clouds, in addition to its movement and distribution of trace components. With a highly eccentric orbit (periapsis altitude of 400?km and apoapsis of 310,000?km), it will be able to take close-up photographs of the planet, and should also confirm the presence of both active volcanoes as well as lightning.[72]\\r\\nThe Venus In-Situ Explorer, proposed by NASA's New Frontiers program is a proposed probe which would aid in understanding the processes on the planet that led to climate change, as well as paving the way towards a later sample return mission.[73]\\r\\nAnother craft called the Venus Mobile Explorer has been proposed by the Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) to study the composition and isotopic measurements of the surface and the atmosphere, for about 90 days. A launch date has not yet been set.[74]\\r\\nAfter missions discovered the reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There have been a number of proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.[75]\\r\\nA solar flyer has also been proposed by Geoffrey A. Landis in place of a balloon,[23] and the idea has been featured from time to time since the early 2000s. Venus has a high albedo, and reflects most of the sunlight that shines on it making the surface quite dark, the upper atmosphere at 60?km has an upward solar intensity of 90%, meaning that solar panels on both the top and the bottom of a craft could be used with nearly equal efficiency.[39] In addition to this, the slightly lower gravity, high air pressure and slow rotation allowing for perpetual solar power make this part of the planet ideal for exploration. The proposed flyer would operate best at an altitude where sunlight, air pressure, and wind speed would enable it to remain in the air perpetually, with slight dips down to lower altitudes for a few hours at a time before returning to higher altitudes. As sulfuric acid in the clouds at this height is not a threat for a properly shielded craft, this so-called \\"solar flyer\\" would be able to measure the area in between 45?km and 60?km indefinitely, for however long it takes for mechanical error or unforeseen problems to cause it to fail. Landis also proposed that rovers similar to Spirit and Opportunity could possibly explore the surface, with the difference being that Venus surface rovers would be \\"dumb\\" rovers controlled by radio signals from computers located in the flyer above,[76] only requiring parts such as motors and transistors to withstand the surface conditions, but not weaker parts involved in microelectronics that could not be made resistant to the heat, pressure and acidic conditions.[77]\\r\\nRussian space plan for 2006ÿ2015 involves a launch of Venera-D (Venus-D) probe around 2024.[78] The main scientific goals of the Venera-D mission are investigation of the structure and chemical composition of the atmosphere and investigation of the upper atmosphere, ionosphere, electrical activity, magnetosphere and escape rate.[79]\\r\\nThe High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC) is a NASA concept for exploration of Venus.

As in any military organization, the official and unofficial traditions of the Marine Corps serve to reinforce camaraderie and set the service apart from others. The Corps' embracement of its rich culture and history is cited as a reason for its high esprit de corps.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany traditions and customs of the Corps are officially recognized through orders, histories, and ceremonies; some are even embodied within the uniform itself.\\r\\nThe Marine Corps Core Values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment have gained increased prominence in recent years.[4][5] As an emphasis on performing morally on and off duty, the concept of core values has been infiltrated into many aspects of Marine life, beginning in recruit training and continuing into combat.[6] This \\"warrior ethos\\" provides guidance to Marines in difficult ethical situations and acts as a reminder to provide good order and discipline.[7]\\r\\nThe Marines' Hymn dates back to 1919 and is the oldest official song in the U.S. Armed Forces.[8] It embraces some of the most important battles of the Corps at that time, including Chapultepec and Derna.[9] Subtle changes and unofficial verses have been added as the history of the Corps grew.[10]\\r\\nThe official Marine Corps emblem is the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor, sometimes abbreviated \\"EGA\\". Adopted in its present form in 1868 by Commandant Jacob Zeilin, it derives partially from ornaments worn by the Continental Marines and the British Royal Marines, and is usually topped with a ribbon reading \\"Semper Fidelis\\". The original eagle was a crested eagle found in the Americas, not the bald eagle that appears in the current emblem. The eagle stands on the Western Hemisphere and holds in its beak a scroll bearing the motto \\"Semper Fidelis\\", though the scroll is sometimes omitted from uniform insignia. An anchor fouled with rope stands behind the globe, and while it generally points to the left, it can be found reversed when paired so that the anchors continually face the other.[11] The eagle stands for a proud country, the globe signifies worldwide service, and the fouled anchor signifies naval tradition.\\r\\nThe use of the emblem became official when the seal was adopted in 1955.[12]\\r\\nOn June 22, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed an Executive Order, which approved the design of an official seal for the United States Marine Corps. The new seal had been designed by Felix de Weldon at the request, and with the assistance, of the Commandant Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr.[13]\\r\\nThe new seal consisted of the traditional Marine Corps Eagle, Globe, and Anchor emblem in bronze; however, an American bald eagle replaced the crested eagle depicted on the 1868 emblem, and is depicted with wings displayed, standing upon the western hemisphere of the terrestrial globe, and holding in his beak a scroll inscribed with the Marine Corps motto \\"Semper Fidelis\\" with the hemisphere superimposed on a fouled anchor. The seal is displayed on a scarlet background encircled with a Navy blue band edged in a gold rope rim and inscribed \\"Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps\\" in gold letters.[12]\\r\\nCoincident with the approval of this seal by the President, the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor emblem centered on the seal was adopted in 1955 as the official Marine Corps Emblem.\\r\\nThe blue signifies naval ties, while the scarlet and gold are the official Marine Corps colors.[14][15] They appear ubiquitously in the Marine Corps, particularly on signage. They also form the base colors of the flag of the United States Marine Corps.\\r\\nThe Marine motto \\"Semper Fidelis\\" means \\"always faithful\\" in Latin.[15] This motto often appears in the shortened form \\"Semper Fi\\" /?s?mp?r ?fa?/. It is also the name of the official march of the Corps, composed by John Philip Sousa. It was adopted in 1883 when Commandant Charles McCawley added it to the seal, before which the traditional mottos were \\"Fortitudine\\" (With Fortitude); \\"By Sea and by Land\\", a translation of the Royal Marines' \\"Per Mare, Per Terram\\"; and \\"To the Shores of Tripoli\\", which was later revised to \\"From the Halls of the Montezumas to the Shores of Tripoli\\" and formed the first lines of the Marines' Hymn.[16]\\r\\nThe recruiting slogan of \\"A Few Good Men\\" (as opposed to the play and film) derives from a Continental Marines recruiting poster:\\r\\nThe modern recruiting slogan is \\"the few, the proud, the Marines.\\"[17]\\r\\nThe Rifleman's Creed is a similar concept as the motto, but offers a more modern look at doctrine. It explains to a recruit the importance of his or her weapon but also emphasizes the moral motivations behind using it.\\r\\nTwo styles of swords are worn by Marines. The Marine Corps officers' sword is a Mameluke Sword, similar to the Persian shamshir presented to Lt. Presley O'Bannon after the Battle of Derna during the First Barbary War.[9] After its adoption in 1825 and initial distribution in 1826, Mameluke Swords have been worn by Marine officers ever since, except during the period 1859ÿ1875, when they were required to wear the Army's Model 1850-foot officers' sword. Upon returning to the traditional sword, many officers gave their Army swords to their senior noncommissioned officer, creating the basis for the NCO sword.[18] Generally, Marines are the only branch where enlisted members regularly carry a sword (the Army authorizes platoon and first sergeants to carry a Model 1840 sword during some ceremonies,[19] while the Chief of Naval Operations authorized Chief Petty Officers and above to carry an optional ceremonial cutlass with dress uniforms in 2010[20]).\\r\\nThe Marine Corps Birthday is celebrated every year on 10 November, when the Second Continental Congress raised two battalions of Marines. Tun Tavern is regarded as the location of the first Marines to enlist under Commandant Samuel Nicholas.[21]\\r\\nPrior to 1921, Marines celebrated the July 11, 1798 recreation of the Corps (having been disbanded following the end of the Revolutionary War) with little fanfare. Then, Marine Corps Order 47 was published by Commandant John A. Lejeune:[22]\\r\\nNo. 47 (Series 1921) HEADQUARTERS U.S. MARINE CORPS Washington, November 1, 1921\\r\\n759. The following will be read to the command on the 10th of November, 1921, and hereafter on the 10th of November of every year. Should the order not be received by the 10th of November, 1921, it will be read upon receipt.\\r\\nJOHN A. LEJEUNE, Major General Commandant 75705--21\\r\\nThe celebrations were formalized by Commandant Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr. in 1952, outlining the cake cutting ceremony, which would enter the Marine Drill Manual in 1956. By tradition, the first slice of cake is given to the oldest Marine present, who in turn hands it off to the youngest Marine present, symbolizing the old and experienced Marines passing their knowledge to the new generation of Marines. Lejeune's message is also republished annually.\\r\\nClose Order Drill is heavily emphasized early on in a Marine's training. Formal ceremonies, such as the Marine Corps Birthday Ball, a change of command, or a retirement, will almost always incorporate some form of close order drill. The Marine Corps uses close order drill to teach discipline by instilling habits of precision and automatic response to orders, increase the confidence of junior officers and noncommissioned officers through the exercise of command and give Marines an opportunity to handle individual weapons.[23]\\r\\nThe Mess Night is a borrowed tradition of ceremonial dining.[24] Originally a British Army tradition, it has become an honored tradition of enjoying drink, good food, and fellowship with a Marine's comrades,[25] as well as honoring those who have perished in battle.[26]\\r\\nMarines have a high reverence for their history, indoctrinating recruits and continually expanding the topic in the professional education Marines attend throughout their careers. The History Division, a subunit of the Training and Education Command, records, archives, researches, analyzes, and presents the history of the Corps.[28]\\r\\nSeveral Marine Corps museums have been established, most notably the National Museum of the Marine Corps at Quantico, Virginia. Additional Marine history can be found at the Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum, the MCRD San Diego Command Museum, the Marine Corps Air-Ground Museum, the Marine Corps Legacy Museum, the Parris Island Museum, the WWII/Korea LVT Museum, and the Waterhouse Museum.\\r\\nMemorials also serve as a way to preserve history. One of the most iconic memorials is the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery, a statue recreated from the iconic photo Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima. Other memorials to Marines (sometimes including other services) include the two of the many statues named Iron Mike (Belleau, France and Parris Island, South Carolina), the USS Arizona Memorial, Navy ÿ Marine Corps Memorial Stadium at the United States Naval Academy, as well as many period specific military memorial around the country where Marines participated in fighting, such as the National World War II Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.\\r\\nThe Corps has many unofficial traditions, promulgated by many Marines and some Marine-based organizations (such as the Marine Corps League, Marine Corps Association, and Young Marines) or media (such as the Marine Corps Gazette, Leatherneck Magazine, or Marine Corps Times). Marines are not \\"soldiers,\\" or \\"sailors.\\"[29]\\r\\nMarines have been given many generic nicknames:\\r\\nThe ethos that \\"Once a Marine, Always a Marine\\" has led to the objection to the use of the term \\"ex-Marine\\", leading to a myriad of forms of address for those no longer on active duty:\\r\\nThe Marine Corps places a high institutional value on physical readiness, preparing the individual's body for the rigors of combat.[34] Mandatory participation in three hours weekly of physical exercise, termed \\"Physical Training\\" or PT, is considered a minimum starting point; further fitness is rewarded by better evaluation scores, which increase promotability, as well as benefits for winning athletic competitions. In addition, height and weight standards and body fat percentage ensure that Marines are fit and present a good military appearance. Chronic lack of physical fitness can be grounds for administrative punishment, and even discharge in extreme situations. The Physical Fitness Test is performed annually to assess a Marine's fitness, and higher scores weigh in his or her favor for promotions.\\r\\nTo encourage physical training, Commandant James T. Conway authorized a new physical training uniform based on a tracksuit and the development of the Combat Fitness Test to better simulate the specific stressors of combat.[35][36]\\r\\nFor decades, Marines learned a variety of martial arts and other methods of hand-to-hand combat, but these were irregular processes that varied greatly from unit to unit and from time to time. Eventually, the Corps solidified its various teachings into the LINE combat system, but its inherent inflexibility was evident. In 2001, the Marine Corps initiated a new program, called Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). Due to an expectation that urban and police-type peacekeeping missions would become more common in the 21st century, placing Marines in even closer contact with unarmed civilians, MCMAP was implemented to provide Marines with a larger and more versatile set of less-than-lethal options for controlling hostile, but unarmed individuals. It is also a stated aim of the program to instill and maintain the \\"Warrior Ethos\\" within Marines.[7] The Marine Corps Martial Arts program is an eclectic mix of different styles of martial arts melded together and consists of boxing movements, joint locking techniques, opponent weight transfer (Jujitsu), ground grappling (mostly wrestling), bayonet, knife and baton fighting, non-compliance joint manipulations, and blood restriction chokes. Marines begin MCMAP training in boot camp, earning the first of five belts.\\r\\nThe Marine Corps, like any other branch of the military, is most visible by the public through public affairs organs and several presentation units. Dedication to proficiency in drill is a hallmark of the Silent Drill Platoon, Marine Band, and the Drum and Bugle Corps. In addition, the Corps released periodic recruiting commercials, often about one annually. The traditional tagline for the commercials is \\"The Few, The Proud, The Marines.\\" While Marines do not have installations across the United States (unlike the Army and Air Force, Marine installations are concentrated in California, North Carolina, and the national capitol region), the direct link for most Americans to the Corps is the Marine recruiter, often recognizable in the Dress Blue uniform. Marines also make popular subjects for works of fiction. The Marine Corps has been depicted on many films, television shows, innumerable books, and even video games.\\r\\nSince 2001, Gallup polls have asked \\"Which of the four major branches of the armed forces are the most prestigious?.\\" Every year of the Gallup poll showed that the American public regards the Corps as the most prestigious of the four branches of the armed forces of the Department of Defense.[37] However, when ranked by importance, it did not score well until it tied the Army and Air Force in 2004, with the increase being attributed to the Iraq War.[38]","input":"What are the values of the marine corps?"},{"output":"Staying Alive","context":"Staying Alive is a 1983 American dance film starring John Travolta as dancer Tony Manero, with Cynthia Rhodes, Finola Hughes, Joyce Hyser, Julie Bovasso, and dancers Viktor Manoel and Kevyn Morrow. It is a sequel to 1977's Saturday Night Fever. The film was directed by Sylvester Stallone, who also co-produced and co-wrote the film with the original Saturday Night Fever producer and writer, Robert Stigwood and Norman Wexler, respectively. This is, along with Homefront, one of only two films which Stallone wrote without being the star (although he does have a cameo appearance). The choreography was done by Dennon and Sayhber Rawles.\\r\\nThe title of the film comes from the Bee Gees song of the same name, which was used as the theme song to Saturday Night Fever and is also played during the final scene of Staying Alive. The title also reflects Tony's circumstances at the beginning of the film, in which he is barely surviving as he pursues his dream of making dancing his career.\\r\\nUnlike Saturday Night Fever, Staying Alive was widely panned by film critics, and holds a score of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. Nonetheless, it was a box office success, earning $65 million on a $22 million budget.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthony \\"Tony\\" Manero, a former disco king, acts on his brother's advice and his own dreams of dancing professionally. He is now living in a Manhattan flophouse, working as a dance instructor and waiter at a dance club, searching for a big break in the modern dance productions on Broadway. The break from his Brooklyn life, family, and friends seem to have somewhat matured Tony and refined his personality, including his diminished Brooklyn accent, an avoidance of alcohol, and less use of profanity. Other attitudes remain unchanged, such as his disregard for his girlfriend, the forgiving Jackie, who is a dancer and rock singer. Still acting immature, Tony maintains some of his other macho and childish double standards, such as seeing other women but being offended if he sees Jackie with other men.\\r\\nTony watches a show, which features Jackie as a dancer in the chorus, but focuses on the lead, a seemingly-wealthy English dancer, Laura. Tony pursues her with seduction in mind, and spends the night with her. He is annoyed when she dismisses him afterward, not understanding that she intended their encounter to be a one-night stand. Laura coldly justifies her treatment of him by saying that \\"Everybody uses everybody,\\" and implies that Tony used her in order to get a dance role in her upcoming show.\\r\\nUnable to trust Tony, Jackie breaks up with him. Jackie, Tony, and Laura then all audition for the Broadway production Satan's Alley. Jackie and Tony land small roles, and Laura is cast as the lead female dancer.\\r\\nTony begins to realize how callous he has been to Jackie, and walks all the way from Manhattan to his old Bay Ridge neighborhood in Brooklyn in the middle of the night. When he walks past the 2001 Odyssey, he sees that the discotheque, which was his former hangout, is now a gay nightclub, and he realizes how much his life has changed since he left Brooklyn. When Tony goes to visit his mother, and apologizes for his selfishness and the trouble-making ways of his youth, she points out that his selfish behavior as a teen was what helped him escape a dead-end life in Bay Ridge. Tony feels better after this and heads back to Manhattan to repair his relationship with Jackie. His hostility and distance from the arrogant Laura increase as the production progresses.\\r\\nTony decides to take a shot at replacing the male lead of Satan's Alley, and requests Jackie to help him practice the number. Laura is disgusted when Tony succeeds and openly displays her resentment at having to partner him in the show. They cannot hide their chemistry on stage despite her animosity, which pleases the show's director.\\r\\nSatan's Alley sells out, and the cast takes the stage to a standing-room-only crowd. The first act is a success despite Tony's brash disregard for the script when he kisses Laura at the end of their number. Laura furiously retaliates by clawing Tony's face. The director blasts Tony backstage, telling him to take his personal war away from the production. Laura seems to offer a truce when she asks to see him after the show to \\"clear things up.\\" Tony, now fully aware of her manipulative ways, coldly tells her that he has other commitments, and Laura snidely responds that he lacks star quality.\\r\\nThe second act is a dazzling display of dance and special effects, and Tony suddenly abandons the script near the end of the show. He hurls Laura away and gives way to his frustration in a solo dance. He finishes and holds out his hand to Laura with a command to jump. She halts amid Jackie's and the director's commands, but finally leaps in his arms for a climactic finish to the show. The thrilled audience gives a standing ovation.\\r\\nTony celebrates with his jubilant cast mates and reconciles with Jackie. He says that what he really must do is \\"strut\\" in celebration. He leaves the theater and struts through Times Square, beaming with his newfound success.\\r\\nSome actors from the first movie were also included in the cast, but their performances were cut: Donna Pescow appeared in the audience at Tony's Broadway debut, and Val Bisoglio appeared as Tony's father in a small role.[citation needed] His scene was cut, and the film instead vaguely implies that he has died.\\r\\nSaturday Night Fever producer and writer Robert Stigwood and Norman Wexler started planning a sequel soon after the original film came out in 1977, due to the film's success. They came up with the title Staying Alive, and Wexler wrote a script. Travolta was open to the idea of a sequel, but did not like the pessimism of the script, thinking that his character, Tony Manero, needed to see more success as a dancer.[4] Stigwood and executives from Paramount Pictures spent the next several years trying to convince Travolta to film the script as written, but with no success.[4] The project was considered abandoned, but then in 1981 Stigwood met with Travolta to get Travolta's views on how a sequel should go. Travolta stated that he wanted Manero to attempt a dance career on Broadway and end up in a leading role due to his talent.[4] Wexler wrote another script based on Travolta's ideas, in which Manero becomes a Broadway dancer but remains in the chorus. Travolta agreed to participate in the film, though he preferred an ending more like the one he had envisioned: he agreed that Wexler's ending was a more realistic outcome, but felt that it would not be sufficiently exciting for audiences.[4]\\r\\nIt was then time to find a director for Staying Alive, and Travolta, who had just seen the film Rocky III (which Stallone wrote, directed and starred in), told his agent that he wanted a director who could bring the energy and pacing of that film to Staying Alive. To Travolta's surprise, Paramount, with the help of then-studio chief Michael Eisner, was able to bring in Stallone himself.[4] Travolta told Stallone about his idea for a happier ending, and Stallone rewrote the script to more closely match Travolta's vision. Stallone also made the Manero character more mature - given that the character was now six years older than in the original film - and made the film's language tamer than that of the first film, to ensure that it got a PG rating.[4]\\r\\nUnder Stallone's supervision, Travolta spent five months doing rigorous training to develop a dancer's physique for the film, losing twenty pounds in the process.[4]\\r\\nStaying Alive was blasted by film critics. Roger Ebert called the dance productions \\"laughably gauche\\", especially the final number, which he mocked for including \\"fire, ice, smoke, flashing lights and laser beams\\". Ebert added that what the film most lacked was \\"the sense of reality in \\"Saturday Night Fever\\"... There's no old neighborhood, no vulgar showdowns with his family (he apologizes to his mother for his \\"attitude\\"!) and no Brooklyn eccentricity.\\"[5] In 2006, Entertainment Weekly dubbed Staying Alive the \\"Worst Sequel Ever.\\"[6] Many critics were unanimous in agreeing that the film did not contain the grittiness and realism that Saturday Night Fever possessed. The film holds a score of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews and with the consensus being \\"This sequel to Saturday Night Fever is shockingly embarrassing and unnecessary, trading the original's dramatic depth for a series of uninspired dance sequences.\\"[7]\\r\\nThe film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.[8]\\r\\nDespite being a critical failure, Staying Alive was a commercial success. The film grossed nearly $65 million in the US box office against its $22 million budget. Though the box office intake was significantly less than the $139.5 million[9] earned by Saturday Night Fever, the film nevertheless ranked in the top ten most financially successful films of 1983.\\r\\nThe soundtrack was released in 1983 and is mainly performed by the Bee Gees. Five new Bee Gees songs (all of which have lead vocals by Barry Gibb) took up the first side, with side two featuring various artists performing songs mostly written by Frank Stallone, brother of the film's director Sylvester Stallone. The soundtrack reached number 14 in the United Kingdom, number 6 in the United States, number 1 in Switzerland, and number 2 in Italy and Japan, and sold 5 million copies worldwide. The LP was the final soundtrack, and the final songs, by the Bee Gees released under RSO.","input":"What was the sequel to saturday night fever?"},{"output":"Deap Vally","context":"The Getaway World Tour is an ongoing concert tour by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers that is in support of their eleventh studio album, The Getaway which was released on June 17, 2016. It marked the first time since June 2014 that the band has toured. The tour began with benefit shows and North American festival dates in February 2016 followed by a summer festival tour with dates in Europe, Asia and North America starting in May 2016 and ending in August 2016. The headlining tour to support the album began in Europe in September 2016 and lasted until the end of the year with the North American tour beginning in January 2017 and concluded in July 2017. Another European leg and dates in South American will follow along with rescheduled shows and festival dates in North America in October 2017.[1] Chad Smith said that the entire tour would last for 18 months.[2] The tour placed 32nd at Pollstar's Year-end top 100 worldwide tours for 2016, grossing a total of $46.2?million from 40 shows.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior the summer festival dates in June 2016 and start of their headlining tour in September 2016, the band performed at a few benefit and North American festivals.

You do this incredible thing in the studio and then you go practice and rehearse and make sure you can play this stuff live and then you go see the world. You know everywhere; from Asia to South America to Europe and Eastern Europe and hopefully the Middle East and Africa and you know, you give this music life to people far far away that it means something to and you have this communal experience together. And when you just can't take it for another day and you're beat and you're haggard and you're tired and you want to collapse and you come home and you gather some new life experience and start writing a little bit and Flea sits down at the piano and says, 'Hey, I have these chords. What do you think about these chords? And I say, hmmm, I hear melody in there and you start it all over again.\\"[14] Drummer Chad Smith said on May 17, 2016 that the band would be playing in Europe for pretty much the remainder of the year once the tour starts with the North American tour not happening until 2017.[12]\\r\\nAll purchases of tickets through the band's website include a free download or physical copy of The Getaway. The production for the arena tour featured over 800 tube lights that stretched out across the audience.

After over three years not being performed, \\"Tell Me Baby\\" returned to the setlist on June 12, 2016 at Novarock. The rarely performed \\"She's Only 18\\" also made its return after a two-year absence. On June 13, 2016, in a pre-taped segment on The Late Late Show with James Corden, the band appeared in the show's popular Carpool Karaoke segment.[15] During the filming of the segment, Kiedis saved the life of a baby. \\"a woman came out of her house, holding a child saying 'My baby, my baby, my baby can't breathe!' We all ran across the street, the woman thrust the baby into my arms, the baby was not breathing and I thought 'Im gonna try and do a little baby CPR real quick, see if I can get some air in this kid.' Tried to open the mouth, [it was] like locked shut. So I started rubbing the belly, bubbles came out of the mouth, the eyes rolled back into place, the ambulance showed up and I handed the baby over, who was now breathing and fine, and we went back to Carpool Karaoke. The little baby looked at me the entire time until the ambulance came, little baby Nina.\\" Kiedis said[16] On June 14, 2016, the band performed eight songs at Studios SFP in France. \\"Dark Necessities\\" and \\"Give it Away\\" appeared on the television show Le Grand Journal[17] while the remaining six songs, which included the live debut of \\"The Longest Wave\\", were recorded for radio station RTL2's \\"Trs Trs Priv\\" concert series.

Yes. There are moments of having a hard time finding the essence and spirit of a song, but in general it's all about the people in the end. It's all about connecting with the people.I try to keep myself in a place of being completely selfless about it and doing my best to use every song, whether it's one I've heard a million times or a new one, as a vehicle for connecting with people and making them feel less alone in the world.\\"[18]\\r\\nThe band's European headlining tour began on September 1, 2016 and lasted until mid-December 2016. Deap Vally and Babymetal served as the opening acts. \\"Feasting on the Flowers\\" made its live debut on September 8, 2016 in Oslo, followed by \\"The Longest Wave\\" second time ever played on September 14 in Helsinki. \\"Search and Destroy\\" was performed for the first time since 2003 on September 10, 2016 in Sweden and for the first time with Klinghoffer.

The song was dedicated to one of the band's longtime fans who had been following them on the tour. Due to Kiedis suffering from flu like symptoms, the band was forced to postpone their December 20 and 21 shows in Ireland until September 20 and 21, 2017.[21]\\r\\nThe band performed two songs before the opening home game of the Los Angeles Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on September 18, 2016. The Rams made their return to Los Angeles after 22 years in St. Louis. \\"Since I was a little boy, I've taken joy in the beauty of the Rams. When I moved to Los Angeles in 1972, I was getting uprooted from my home and I thought, 'Well, where I'm going they've got the Rams. It's going to be all right'\\" Flea said.[22] On September 23, 2016, the band performed a short acoustic set at a benefit for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music. \\"Mommy, Where's Daddy?\\" from the band's debut album was performed for only the second time in the past 17 years (it was last performed in late 2015) and for the first time ever acoustically.\\r\\nThe band's 51 date North American leg began on January 5, 2017 will conclude on July 1, 2017. Due to overwhelming demand for tickets after selling out quickly and in response to scalpers, second shows in Boston and Philadelphia were added while second and third shows in New York City and Los Angeles were also added. Jack Irons,[23] the band's original drummer and founding member of the band, will serve as opening act on all North American dates while Trombone Shorty and Orleans Avenue, Babymetal, IRONTOM and Deerhoof will serve as opening acts at various dates on the leg.[24][25][26] At the opening show on the North American leg in San Antonio on January 5, 2017, the band performed \\"Breaking the Girl\\" for the first time since October 2012. \\"The Zephyr Song\\" was performed for the first time in the United States since July 2004 during the band's show of January 8, 2017 in Dallas, TX. At that same show, Josh teased a cover of David Bowie's \\"The Bewlay Brothers\\" as a tribute to Bowie who died a year earlier on January 9, 2016. Members of The Meters, The Rebirth Brass Band and Trombone Shorty joined the band on \\"Give it Away\\" during their show of January 10, 2017 in New Orleans. The band was forced to postpone their Wichita show on January 15, 2017 to the following night due to inclement weather. On February 13, at their Philadelphia gig band teased 50 seconds version of \\"Out in L.A\\", in honor of their 34th anniversary. It was first time that song was performed since 1992 (according to some sources 2004) and first time with Josh.[27] On March 2, 2017, the band announced that they were going to postpone their March 2, 4, 5 shows in Glendale, Denver and San Diego due to Anthony suffering from bronchitis. The San Diego date was rescheduled for later in the month while the other two dates were pushed back to October 2017. On March 17, 2017 at their show in Seattle, the band performed \\"Charlie\\" for the first time since 2012. On April 24, 2017 at their show in Jacksonville, \\"Encore\\" made its live debut, after some teases throughout the previous tours. At the band's show in Pittsburgh on May 11, 2017 they performed a cover of the Looking Glass song \\"Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)\\". The song was last performed in 2005 and played at most shows during their Roll on the Red tour. It also appeared on their Live in Hyde Park album. Following the band's performance of May 14, 2017 in Columbus, OH, Chad Smith sang the University of Michigan fight song \\"The Victors\\". Smith's singing of the fight song made national news as the University of Michigan and Ohio State University are longtime sports rivals and Smith was born in Detroit, MI. Smith's drumset also like at past shows in Ohio featured the Michigan Wolverines logo.[28] At the band's show of May 16, 2017 in Louisville, KY, \\"Mommy, Where's Daddy?\\" was performed. The song, which is very rarely played, was last performed in November 2016 has been performed just four times since 1992 and only three times in the United States since then. \\"This Ticonderoga\\" was also performed for just the third time and first time since September 2016.

Cornell, the front man for Soundgarden and Audioslave, was found dead earlier that day.[29] At the band's show on May 28, 2017 in Edmonton they performed \\"Dosed\\" for the first time ever. It was teased in the past but the song had never been performed in its entirety since it was released in 2002. Zach Irons, son of founding Chili Peppers member Jack Irons and guitarist for opening act IRONTOM, provided a second guitar on the song. At this same show, Flea also briefly teased \\"Deep Kick\\", a song that hasn't been performed since 1996.

During the band's show on June 25, 2017 in Grand Rapids, Anthony Kiedis dedicated \\"Soul to Squeeze\\" to his father, Blackie Dammett, who was the long time manager of the band's fanclub and ran their website. Kiedis said \\"If you could be so kind. My father is fixin' to die and that's OK. He's had a wild, great journey and a helluva colourful badass life but he's sick and he's gonna to die now.. He's pretty lost; he's just a spirit but I would like for everyone just to take ten seconds to send him some love, to send his spirit some love because pretty soon he will be sailing on and I would appreciate it if his home town could send him love for a whole ten seconds of love. Let's give it up. Ten! Thank you. Let's do this tune. Appreciate it.\\" Flea also during the show asked for a moment of silence for Hillel Slovak, the band's founding guitarist who died 29 years earlier. Following the moment of silence, Jack Irons joined his former band on stage to perform Jimi Hendrix's \\"Fire\\" as a tribute to Slovak.[30][31]\\r\\nDave Rat, who has been with the band since February 1991 as the band's sound engineer, announced on January 12, 2017 that he would no longer be working with the band following their show of January 22, 2017 in Minnesota.[32]\\r\\nAt the band's show in Atlanta on April 14, 2017 they shot the music video for their song \\"Goodbye Angels\\".

The leg will consist of mostly festivals along with some headlining dates with the leg expected to conclude on July 31, 2017. The second date on the leg saw the band perform for the first time ever in Benicassim. The show featured a rare performance of \\"Fire\\" which was performed for only the fifth time on this tour. Mauro Refosco, who was a touring member of the band for their previous tour and also a studio musician on their two most recent albums, joined the band on percussion for \\"The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie\\" at their July 20, 2017 show in Rome. Kiedis' young son Everly Bear also joined the band onstage to provide some vocals for \\"Goodbye Angels\\" which he also would do at the band's very first show in Latvia seven days later.[34]\\r\\nDue to Anthony Kiedis suffering from the flu, the band's shows on December 20 and 21, 2016 in Dublin at 3Arena were forced to be postponed and were rescheduled for September 20 and 21, 2017 at the same venue.

The community was named after two leaders in the struggle for Texas independence, brothers John and William Wharton. The plantation community was first settled in 1846 by some of Stephen F. Austin's original colonists, and a post office was established in 1847. The first lieutenant governor of Texas, Albert Horton, was an early settler. Land for the courthouse square was donated by William Kincheloe and surveyed by Virgil Stewart and William J. E. Heard. Early settlers came from Alabama, Kentucky, Virginia, Georgia, and Mississippi.\\r\\nJewish immigrants, arriving as early as the 1850s, established additional businesses and began the Congregation Shearith Israel (Texas), the only synagogue in a three-county area.[9] Other settlers in the community included Swiss, German, Mexican, and Czech immigrants and descendants of plantation slaves.\\r\\nEarly crops included potatoes, cotton, corn, rice, and sugar cane, and commercial enterprises included cattle, molasses, and sugar. At different times the community had a cotton oil mill, a sugar cane factory, gristmills, cotton gins, a milk processing plant and dairy, an ice plant, and numerous other industries. Oil and sulfur production in the outlying areas contribute to the town's economy. The population of Wharton was about 200 in the early 1880s.\\r\\nThe New York, Texas and Mexican Railway was the first railroad to arrive at Wharton in 1881, followed by the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe in 1899. These two railroads brought a new influx of settlers, increasing the population to 1,689 in 1900 and 2,346 in 1920. In 1888 the first opera house opened.\\r\\nWharton was incorporated in 1902, when most of the structures were of wood construction. A major fire on December 30 of that year destroyed a number of frame business buildings.[10] Afterwards, businessmen and the city government were convinced to use brick construction with fire walls for all buildings within the city limits and to construct a water system with fire hydrants. A free library was established in 1902 by the New Century Club and adopted by the city in 1904. In 1935 the majority of the library inventory was given to the Wharton Public School. The first public park was dedicated in 1913, and the Wharton Chamber of Commerce organized in 1919.\\r\\nThe city experienced its greatest growth during the 1930s, increasing from 2,261 in 1930 to 4,386 in 1940. Wharton Little Theatre was organized in 1932, and Wharton County Junior College was established in 1946. The town's population reached 5,734 in 1960 and 7,881 in 1970. A community concert series was developed in the 1960s. By the 1980s Wharton had such diverse industries as Health-focus, the largest physical rehabilitation and therapy service in the nation; M. I. Drilling Fluids, a subsidiary of Magcobar Division of Dresser Industries; the Formosa Plastics Group, consisting of Nan Ya Plastics and J-M Manufacturing; Coastal Warehouse Limited, serving the agricultural industry; and Gulf Coast Medical Center and South Texas Medical clinics. The economy was also heavily dependent on the presence of the county government.\\r\\nIn the 1980s Academy Awardÿwinning screenwriter Horton Foote, a descendant of Lieutenant Governor Horton, lived in Wharton. The Wharton County Historical Museum features exhibits on Dan Rather and Medal of Honor recipient Roy Benavidez as well as a wildlife collection.

Since only two thirds of the outer tooth can be reached by a toothbrush, interdental cleaning (with floss or an interdental brush) can usefully accompany tooth brushing. Together, these two activities are the primary means of cleaning teeth, one of the main aspects of oral hygiene.\\r\\nBrushing teeth properly helps prevent cavities, and periodontal, or gum disease, which causes at least one-third of adult tooth loss.[1] If teeth are not brushed correctly and frequently, it could lead to the calcification of saliva minerals, forming tartar. Tartar hardens (then referred to as 'calculus') if not removed every 24 hours. Poor dental health has been associated with heart disease and shortened life expectancy.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs long ago as 3000 B.C., the ancient Egyptians constructed crude toothbrushes from twigs and leaves to clean their teeth. Similarly, other cultures such as the Greeks, Romans, Arabs and Indians cleaned their teeth with twigs. Some would fray one end of the twig so that it could penetrate between the teeth more effectively.\\r\\nModern day toothbrushing as a regular habit became prevalent in Europe after contact with the Muslim world in Africa and Asia where the people's teeth remained healthy into old age. It was advised as a scientifically supported practice toward the end of the 17th century. The modern toothbrush was developed in England in 1780. While languishing in jail, Thomas Addis decided to drill holes into a sheep's tibia, and pulled through the bristles of boar hair. While he was credited with the discovery of the modern toothbrush, a similar design has since been discovered in China from 1400. In the United States, although toothbrushes were available at the end of the 19th century, the practice did not become widespread until after the Second World War, when U.S. soldiers continued the toothbrushing that had been required during their military service.[5][better?source?needed]\\r\\nAlthough there is a consensus that a thorough toothbrushing once a day is sufficient for maintaining oral health, most dentists recommend patients brush twice a day since a sufficient level of thoroughness in brushing is not normally achieved.[6]\\r\\nThe front and backs of teeth should be brushed with the toothbrush at a 45 degree angle towards the gumline, moving the brush in a back and forth rolling motion that makes contact with the gumline and tooth.[7] To brush the backs of the front teeth the brush should be held vertically to the tooth and moved in an up and down motion.[7] The chewing surfaces of the teeth are brushed with a forward and back motion, with the toothbrush pointing straight at the tooth.[7]\\r\\nA toothbrush is an instrument used to clean teeth, consisting of a small brush on a handle. Toothpaste, often containing fluoride, is commonly added to a toothbrush to aid in cleaning. Toothbrushes come in manual and electric varieties. Although there is conflicting evidence as to which is more effective, most evidence points to electric toothbrushes with an oscillatory motion being more effective than manual toothbrushes, with toothbrushes lacking an oscillatory motion being equivalent.[8] Both manual and electric toothbrushes are effective, however, and it is often recommended that people use whichever one they feel comfortable with and will be more likely to regularly brush with.[9]\\r\\nToothbrushes are offered with varying textures of bristles, and come in many different forms and sizes. Most dentists recommend using a toothbrush labelled \\"soft\\", since firmer bristled toothbrushes can damage tooth enamel and irritate gums as indicated by the American Dental Association.[citation needed] Toothbrushes are often made from synthetic fibers, although natural toothbrushes are also known in many parts of the world. Those with dentures may also brush their teeth with traditional tooth brushes, specially made denture brushes or denture cleaners.\\r\\nToothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used to clean and improve the aesthetic appearance and health of teeth. It is almost always used in conjunction with a toothbrush. Toothpaste use can promote good oral hygiene: it can aid in the removal of dental plaque and food from the teeth, it can aid in the elimination and/or masking of halitosis when tonsil stones are not the cause, and it can deliver active ingredients such as fluoride to prevent tooth and gum (gingiva) disease.\\r\\nThere is evidence that the addition of xylitol to fluoride-containing toothpastes reduces incidence of tooth decay by about 13%.[10]\\r\\nTooth powder (or 'toothpaste powder') is an alternative to toothpaste. It may be recommended for people with sensitive teeth. Tooth powder typically does not contain the chemical sodium lauryl sulphate which can be a skin irritant.[11][better?source?needed] The function of sodium lauryl sulphate is to form suds when teeth are brushed. It is a common chemical in toothpaste. Those with dentures may also use denture cleaner which can also come in powder format.","input":"What did romans use to clean their teeth?"},{"output":"2000-2001","context":"Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Hindi: ???? ?????? ??????, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyn, English: Education for All Movement), or SSA, is an Indian Government programme aimed at the universalisation of elementary education \\"in a time bound manner\\", as mandated by the 86th Amendment to the Constitution of India making free and compulsory education to children between the ages of 6 to 14 (estimated to be 205 million children in 2001) a fundamental right.

The Central share was funded by a number of external agencies, including the World Bank, DFID and UNICEF.[4] By 2001, more than US$1500 million had been committed to the programme, and 50 million children covered in its ambit. In an impact assessment of Phase I of DPEP, the authors concluded that its net impact on minority children was impressive, while there was little evidence of any impact on the enrolment of girls. Nevertheless, they concluded that the investment in DPEP was not a waste, because it introduced a new approach to primary school interventions in India.[4]\\r\\nThe Right to Education Act (RTE) came into force on 1 April 2010.

The programme will not only provide print rich environment, timely distribution of books but will also include new teacher mentoring and appraisal system.[9][better?source?needed] SSA has been operational since 2000-2001 to provide for a variety of interventions for universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in elementary education and improving the quality of learning. SSA interventions include inter alia, opening of new schools and alternate schooling facilities, construction of schools and additional classrooms, toilets and drinking water, provisioning for teachers, regular teacher in service training and academic resource support, free textbooks& uniforms and support for improving learning achievement levels / outcome. With the passage of the RTE Act, changes have been incorporated into the SSA approach, strategies and norms. The changes encompass the vision and approach to elementary education, guided by the following principles?: Holistic view of education, as interpreted in the National Curriculum Framework 2005, with implications for a systemic revamp of the entire content and process of education with significant implications for curriculum, teacher education, educational planning and management. Equity, to mean not only equal opportunity, but also creation of conditions in which the disadvantaged sections of the society ÿ children of SC, ST, Muslim minority, landless agricultural workers and children with special needs, etc. ÿ can avail of the opportunity. Access, not to be confined to ensuring that a school becomes accessible to all children within specified distance but implies an understanding of the educational needs and predicament of the traditionally excluded categories ÿ the SC, ST and others sections of the most disadvantaged groups, the Muslim minority, girls in general, and children with special needs. Gender concern, implying not only an effort to enable girls to keep pace with boys but to view education in the perspective spelt out in the National Policy on Education 1986 /92; i.e. a decisive intervention to bring about a basic change in the status of women. Centrality of teacher, to motivate them to innovate and create a culture in the classroom, and beyond the classroom, that might produce an inclusive environment for children, especially for girls from oppressed and marginalised backgrounds. Moral compulsion is imposed through the RTE Act on parents, teachers, educational administrators and other stakeholders, rather than shifting emphasis on punitive processes. Convergent and integrated system of educational management is pre-requisite for implementation of the RTE law. All states must move in that direction as speedily as feasible[citation needed]\\r\\nIts goals of 2015 are to:[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are several Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), which are also progressively working in the direction of the upliftment of children, especially in the field of health and education.

Technical writers research and create information through a variety of delivery mediums (electronic, printed, audio-visual and even touch).[1] Example types of information include online help, manuals, white papers, design specifications, project plans, software test plans, etc. With the rise of e-learning, technical writers are increasingly becoming involved with creating online training material.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Society for Technical Communication (STC):[2] \\r\\nTechnical writing is sometimes defined as simplifying the complex.  Inherent in such a concise and deceptively simple definition is a whole range of skills and characteristics that address nearly every field of human endeavor at some level.  A significant subset of the broader field of technical communication, technical writing involves communicating complex information to those who need it to accomplish some task or goal.\\r\\n\\r\\n In other words, technical writers take advanced technical concepts and communicate them as clearly, accurately, and comprehensively as possible to their intended audience, ensuring that the work is accessible to its users.\\r\\n\\r\\nKurt Vonnegut described technical writers as:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n...trained to reveal almost nothing about themselves in their writing. This makes them freaks in the world of writers, since almost all of the other ink-stained wretches in that world reveal a lot about themselves to the reader.\\r\\n\\r\\nEngineers, scientists, and other professionals may also be involved in technical writing (developmental editing, proofreading, etc), but are more likely to employ professional technical writers to develop, edit and format material, and advise the best means of information delivery to their audiences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Society for Technical Communication (STC), the professions of technical communication and technical writing were first referenced around World War II[5], when technical documents became a necessity for military purposes. The job title emerged in the US during World War II[6], although it wasn't until 1951 that the first \\"Help Wanted: Technical Writer\\" ad was published.[7] In fact, the title \\"Technical Writer\\" wasn't added to the US Bureau of Labor Statistic's Occupational Employment Handbook until 2010.[8] During the 1940s and 50s, technical communicators and writers were hired to produce documentation for the military, often including detailed instructions on new weaponry. Other technical communicators and writers were involved in developing documentation for new technologies that were developed around this time. According to O'Hara:[9] \\r\\nWar was the most important driver of scientific and technological advance. The U.S. Army Medical Corps battled malaria in the jungles of Panama, the Chemical Corps pushed chemical advances in explosives and poisonous gases (and defenses against them), the Manhattan District of the Corps of Engineers literally made quantum leaps in the understanding of physics, and the Air Corps pioneered aviation design.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the beginning of the profession, most technical writers worked in an office environment with a team of other writers. Like technical writers today, they conducted primary research and met with subject matter experts to ensure that their information was accurate. During World War II, one of the most important characteristics for technical writers was their ability to follow stringent government specifications for documents.[10] After the war, the rise of new technology, such as the computer, allowed technical writers to work in other areas, producing[11] \\"user manuals, quick reference guides, hardware installation manuals, and cheat sheets.\\" During the time period after the war (1953-1961), technical communicators (including technical writers) became interested in \\"professionalizing\\" their field[12]. According to Malone[13], technical communicators/writers did so by creating professional organizations, cultivating a \\"specialized body of knowledge\\" for the profession, imposing ethical standards on technical communicators, initiating a conversation about certifying practitioners in the field, and working to accredit education programs in the field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe profession has continued to grow-- according to O'Hara, the writing/editing profession, including technical writers, experienced a 22% increase in positions between the years 1994 and 2005. [14] Modern day technical writers work in a variety of contexts. Many technical writers work remotely using VPN or communicate with their team via online portals such as Skype or Zoom. Other technical writers work in an office, but share content with their team through complex content management systems that store documents online. Technical writers may work on government reports, internal documentation, instructions for technical equipment, embedded help within software or systems, or other technical documents. As technology continues to advance, the array of possibilities for technical writers will continue to expand. Many technical writers are responsible for creating technical documentation for mobile applications or help documentation built within mobile or web applications. They may be responsible for creating content that will only be viewed on a hand-held device; much of their work will never be published in a printed booklet like technical documentation of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to solid research, copywriting, language, writing, and revision skills, a technical writer may have skills in:\\r\\n\\r\\nA technical writer may apply their skills in the production of non-technical content, for example, writing high-level consumer information.  Usually, a technical writer is not a subject matter expert (SME), but interviews SMEs and conducts the research necessary to write and compile technically accurate content. Technical writers complete both primary and secondary research to fully understand the topic.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA proficient technical writer has the ability to create, assimilate, and convey technical material in a concise and effective manner. They may specialize in a particular area but must have a good understanding of the products they describe.[15]  For example, API writers primarily work on API documents, while other technical writers specialize in electronic commerce, manufacturing, scientific, or medical material.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical writers gather information from many sources. Their information sources are usually scattered throughout an organization, which can range from developers to marketing departments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Markel[16], good technical documents are measured by eight characteristics: \\"honesty, clarity, accuracy, comprehensiveness, accessibility, conciseness, professional appearance, and correctness.\\" Technical writers are focused on using their careful research to create effective documents that meet these eight characteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo create effective technical documentation, the writer must analyze three elements that comprise the rhetorical situation of a particular project: audience, purpose, and context.[17] These are followed by document design, which determines what the reader sees.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical writers strive to simplify complex concepts or processes to maximize reader comprehension. The final goal of a particular document is to help readers find what they need, understand what they find, and use what they understand appropriately.[18]  To reach this goal, technical writers must understand how their audiences use and read documentation. An audience analysis at the outset of a document project helps define what an audience for a particular document requires.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen analyzing an audience the technical writer typically asks:[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccurate audience analysis provides a set of guidelines that shape document content, design and presentation (online help system, interactive website, manual, etc.), and tone and knowledge level.\\r\\n\\r\\nA technical writer analyzes the purpose (or function) of a communication to understand what a document must accomplish.  Determining if a communication aims to persuade readers to think or act a certain way, enable them to perform a task, help them understand something, change their attitude,[17] etc., guides the technical writer on how to format their communication, and the kind of communication they choose (online help system, white paper, proposal, etc.).\\r\\n\\r\\nContext is the physical and temporal circumstances in which readers use communicationfor example: at their office desks, in a manufacturing plant, during the slow summer months, or in the middle of a company crisis.[17]  Understanding the context of a situation tells the technical writer how readers use the communication.  This knowledge significantly influences how the writer formats the communication. For example, if the document is a quick troubleshooting guide to the controls on a small watercraft, the writer may have the pages laminated to increase usable life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the above information has been gathered, the document is designed for optimal readability and usability.  According to one expert, technical writers use six design strategies to plan and create technical communication: arrangement, emphasis, clarity, conciseness, tone, and ethos.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical writers can have various job titles, including technical communicator, information developer, technical content developer or technical documentation specialist. In the United Kingdom and some other countries, a technical writer is often called a technical author or knowledge author.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical writers normally possess a mixture of technical and writing abilities. They typically have a degree or certification in a technical field, but may have one in journalism, business, or other fields.  Many technical writers switch from another field, such as journalismor a technical field such as engineering or science, often after learning important additional skills through technical communications classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo create a technical document, a technical writer must understand the subject, purpose, and audience. They gather information by studying existing material, interviewing SMEs, and often actually using the product. They study the audience to learn their needs and technical understanding level.\\r\\n\\r\\nA technical publication's development life cycle typically consists of five phases, coordinated with the overall product development plan:[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document development life cycle typically consists of six phases (This changes organization to organization, how they are following).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is similar to the software development life cycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell-written technical documents usually follow formal standards or guidelines. Technical documentation comes in many styles and formats, depending on the medium and subject area. Printed and online documentation may differ in various ways, but still adhere to largely identical guidelines for prose, information structure, and layout. Usually, technical writers follow formatting conventions described in a standard style guide.  In the US, technical writers typically use  The Associated Press Stylebook or the Chicago Manual of Style (CMS). Many companies have internal corporate style guides that cover specific corporate issues such as logo use, branding, and other aspects of corporate style. The Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications is typical of these.\\r\\n\\r\\nEngineering projects, particularly defense or aerospace related projects, often follow national and international documentation standardssuch as ATA100 for civil aircraft or S1000D for civil and defense platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical writers often work as part of a writing or project development team. Typically, the writer finishes a draft and passes it to one or more SMEs who conduct a technical review to verify accuracy and completeness. Another writer or editor may perform an editorial review that checks conformance to styles, grammar, and readability. This person may request for clarification or make suggestions. In some cases the writer or others test the document on audience members to make usability improvements. A final production typically follows an inspection checklist to ensure the quality and uniformity of the published product.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no single standard career path for technical writers, but they may move into project management over other writers. A writer may advance to a senior technical writer position, handling complex projects or a small team of writers and editors. In larger groups, a documentation manager might handle multiple projects and teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical writers may also gain expertise in a particular technical domain and branch into related forms, such as software quality analysis or business analysis. A technical writer who becomes a subject matter expert in a field may transition from technical writing to work in that field. Technical writers commonly produce training for the technologies they documentincluding classroom guides and e-learningand some transition to specialize as professional trainers and instructional designers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical writers with expertise in writing skills can join printed media or electronic media companies, potentially providing an opportunity to make more money or improved working conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S Department of Labor expects technical writer employment to grow 11 percent from 2016 to 2026, slightly faster than the average for all occupations. They expect job opportunities, especially for applicants with technical skills, to be good. The BLS also noted that the expansion of \\"scientific and technical products\\" and the need for technical writers to work in \\"Web-based product support\\" will drive increasing demand.

The HFE gene is located on short arm of chromosome 6 at location 6p21.3 Unusually, the official gene symbol (HFE for High Iron Fe) is not an abbreviation of the official name (hemochromatosis).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProtein encoded by this gene is a membrane protein that is similar to MHC class I-type proteins and associates with beta-2 microglobulin (beta2M). It is thought that this protein functions to regulate circulating iron uptake by regulating the interaction of the transferrin receptor with transferrin.[6]\\r\\nThe HFE gene contains 7 exons spanning 12 kb.[7] The full-length transcript represents 6 exons.[8]\\r\\nHFE protein is composed of 343 amino acids. There are several components, in sequence: a signal peptide (initial part of the protein), an extracellular transferrin receptor-binding region (ϫ1 and ϫ2), a portion that resembles immunoglobulin molecules (ϫ3), a transmembrane region that anchors the protein in the cell membrane, and a short cytoplasmic tail.[7]\\r\\nHFE expression is subjected to alternative splicing. The predominant HFE full-length transcript has ~4.2 kb.[9] Alternative HFE splicing variants may serve as iron regulatory mechanisms in specific cells or tissues.[9]\\r\\nHFE is prominent in small intestinal absorptive cells,[10][11] gastric epithelial cells, tissue macrophages, and blood monocytes and granulocytes,[11][12] and the syncytiotrophoblast, an iron transport tissue in the placenta.[13]\\r\\nThe iron storage disorder hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that usually results from defects in this gene.\\r\\nThe mutation or polymorphism most commonly associated with hemochromatosis is p.?C282Y. About 1/200 of people of Northern European origin have two copies of this variant; they, particularly males, are at high risk of developing hemochromatosis.[14]\\r\\nAllele frequencies of HFE C282Y in ethnically diverse western European white populations are 5-14%[15][16] and in North American non-Hispanic whites are 6-7%.[17] C282Y exists as a polymorphism only in Western European white and derivative populations, although C282Y may have arisen independently in non-whites outside Europe.[18]\\r\\nHFE H63D is cosmopolitan but occurs with greatest frequency in whites of European descent.[19][20] Allele frequencies of H63D in ethnically diverse western European populations are 10-29%.[21] and in North American non-Hispanic whites are 14-15%.[22]\\r\\nAt least 42 mutations involving HFE introns and exons have been discovered, most of them in persons with hemochromatosis or their family members.[23] Most of these mutations are rare. Many of the mutations cause or probably cause hemochromatosis phenotypes, often in compound heterozygosity with HFE C282Y. Other mutations are either synonymous or their effect on iron phenotypes, if any, has not been demonstrated.[23]\\r\\nThe HFE protein interacts with the transferrin receptor TFRC.[24][25] Its primary mode of action is the regulation of the iron storage hormone hepcidin.[26]\\r\\nIt is possible to delete part or all of a gene of interest in mice (or other experimental animals) as a means of studying function of the gene and its protein. Such mice are called knockouts with respect to the deleted gene. Hfe is the mouse equivalent of the human hemochromatosis gene HFE. The protein encoded by Hfe is Hfe. Mice homozygous (two abnormal gene copies) for a targeted knockout of all six transcribed Hfe exons are designated Hfe?/?.[27] Iron-related traits of Hfe?/? mice, including increased iron absorption and hepatic iron loading, are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Thus, the Hfe?/? mouse model simulates important genetic and physiologic abnormalities of HFE hemochromatosis.[27] Other knockout mice were created to delete the second and third Hfe exons (corresponding to ϫ1 and ϫ2 domains of Hfe). Mice homozygous for this deletion also had increased duodenal iron absorption, elevated plasma iron and transferrin saturation levels, and iron overload, mainly in hepatocytes.[28] Mice have also been created that are homozygous for a missense mutation in Hfe (C282Y). These mice correspond to persons with hemochromatosis who are homozygous for HFE C282Y. These mice develop iron loading that is less severe than that of Hfe?/? mice.[29]\\r\\nBlack rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis) develop iron overload. To determine whether the HFE gene of black rhinoceroses has undergone mutation as an adaptive mechanism to improve iron absorption from iron-poor diets, Beutler et al. sequenced the entire HFE coding region of four species of rhinoceros (two browsing and two grazing species). Although HFE was well conserved across the species, numerous nucleotide differences were found between rhinoceros and human or mouse, some of which changed deduced amino acids. Only one allele, p.S88T in the black rhinoceros, was a candidate that might adversely affect HFE function. p.S88T occurs in a highly conserved region involved in the interaction of HFE and TfR1.[30]","input":"What protein does the hfe gene code for?"},{"output":"23-mile","context":"The Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel (CBBT) is a 23-mile (37?km) fixed link crossing at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, the Hampton Roads harbor and nearby mouths of the James and Elizabeth Rivers in the American state of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It connects Northampton County on the Delmarva Peninsula and Eastern Shore with Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Portsmouth on the Western Shore and South side / Tidewater which are part of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area of eight close cities around the harbor's shores and peninsula. The Bridge-Tunnel originally combined 12 miles (19?km) of trestle, two 1-mile-long (1.6?km) tunnels, four artificial islands, four high-level bridges, approximately 2 miles (3.2?km) of causeway, and 5.5 miles (8.9?km) of northeast and southwest approach roadscrossing the Chesapeake Bay and preserving traffic on the Thimble Shoals and Chesapeake dredged shipping channels leading to the Atlantic. It replaced vehicle ferry services that operated from South Hampton Roads and from the Virginia Peninsula since the 1930s. Financed by toll revenue bonds, the BridgeÿTunnel was opened on April 15, 1964,[1] and remains one of only ten bridgeÿtunnel systems in the world, three of which are located in the water dominated Hampton Roads area of Tidewater Virginia.\\r\\nAs of May 2018 the Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel has been crossed by more than 130 million vehicles.[2] The CBBT complex carries U.S. Route 13, the main northÿsouth highway on Virginia's Eastern Shore on the Delmarva peninsula, and, as part of the East Coast's longstanding Ocean Highway, provides the only straight direct link along the East Coast and Atlantic Ocean, between the Eastern Shore and South Hampton Roads regions, as well as an alternate route to link the Northeast U.S.A. and points in between with Norfolk and further south to the Carolinas and Florida. The BridgeÿTunnel saves motorists 95 miles (153?km) and ?1?1?2 hours on a trip between Virginia Beach/Norfolk and points north and east of the Chesapeake and Delaware Valley, River and Bay without going through the traffic congestion in the BaltimoreÿWashington Metropolitan Area further west in Maryland. The $15 toll is partially offset by some savings of highway tolls in Maryland and Delaware and avoiding often heavy traffic on north-south Interstate 95 (I-95) built in the 1960s and completed in the late 1970s and parallel older United States Route 1 (US-1) from the 1920s. From 1995 to 1999, at an additional cost of almost $200 million dollars, the capacity of the above-water portion of bridges on the facility was increased and widened to four lanes. An upgrade of the two-lane tunnels was proposed in following years but has not yet been carried out.\\r\\nThe crossing was officially named the Lucius J. Kellam Jr. BridgeÿTunnel in August 1987, 23 years after opening, honoring one of the civic leaders who had long worked for its development, construction and operation; it continues however to be best known as the Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel. The complex was built by and is operated by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel District, a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia governed by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel Commission and in cooperation with the state Department of Transportation. Costs are recovered through toll collections. In 2002, a Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) study commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly concluded that \\"given the inability of the state to fund future capital requirements of the CBBT, the District and Commission should be retained to operate and maintain the BridgeÿTunnel as a toll facility in perpetuity.\\"\\r\\nOccasionally because of similar names, the Bridge-Tunnel is often confused with the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (also known as the Governor William Preston Lane, Jr. Memorial Bridge) further north in Maryland crossing the middle portion of the Bay from Annapolis to Kent Island on the Maryland Eastern Shore of Delmarva. It was built with two lanes and a higher suspension segment in the middle from 1949 - 1952, with a second parallel wider span of three lanes in 1973. It is one of the longest and highest bridges in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1606, the Virginia Company of London sent an expedition to North America to establish a settlement in the Colony of Virginia. After sailing across the Atlantic Ocean from England, they reached the New World at the southern edge of the mouth of what is now known as the Chesapeake Bay.[3] They named the two flanking Virginia points of land /capes like gateposts at the entrance to the long extensive estuary after the sons of their king, James I, the southern Cape Henry, for the eldest and presumed heir, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and the northern Cape Charles, for his younger brother, Charles, Duke of York (the future King Charles I). A few weeks later they established their first permanent settlement on the southern, mainland, side of the Bay, several miles upstream along the newly named James River at Jamestown on the northern shore on a close-in island for protection, the first permanent settlement in English North America.\\r\\nAcross the Bay, the area north of Cape Charles was located along what became known later as the Delmarva Peninsula. As it bordered the Atlantic Ocean to its east, the region became known as Virginia and neighboring Maryland's Eastern Shore. As the entire colony grew, the Bay was a formidable transportation obstacle for exchanges with the Virginia mainland on the Western Shore. One of the eight original shires of Virginia, Accomac Shire was established there in 1634, eventually becoming the two counties of modern times, Accomack County in the north and Northampton to the south. In comparison to mainland regions, commerce and growth was limited by the need to cross the Bay. Consequently, little industrial base grew there, with the oceanfront peninsula staying predominantly rural with small towns and villages oriented towards life on the waters, and most residents made their living by farming and working as watermen, both on the Bay (locally known as the \\"bay side\\") and in the Atlantic Ocean (\\"sea side\\").\\r\\nFor the first 350 years, ships and ferry systems provided the primary transportation.\\r\\nFrom the early 1930s to 1954, the Virginia Ferry Corporation, a privately owned public service company managed a scheduled vehicular (car, bus, truck) and passenger ferry service between the Virginia Eastern Shore and Princess Anne County (now part of the City of Virginia Beach) on the mainland Western Shore in the South Hampton Roads area. This system, connecting portions of U.S. Route 13, was known as the Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry. In 1951, the Northern terminus in Delmarva was relocated to a location now within Kiptopeke State Park.\\r\\nDespite an expanded fleet of large and modern ships by the V.F.C. in the 1940s and early 1950s which were eventually capable of as many as 90 one-way trips each day, the lengthy crossing suffered delays due to heavy traffic and inclement weather.\\r\\nIn 1954, the General Assembly of Virginia (state legislature) created a political subdivision, the Chesapeake Bay Ferry District and its governing body, the Chesapeake Bay Ferry Commission. The Commission was authorized to acquire the private ferry corporation through bond financing, to improve the existing V.F.C. ferry service.\\r\\nOnce the BridgeÿTunnel was built by 1964, much of the ferry equipment and vessels used by the Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry V.F.C. service was then sold and moved north to be redeployed to start the Cape MayÿLewes Ferry across the 17-mile (27?km) mouth of the Delaware Bay between Cape May, in New Jersey and Lewes across in Delaware still serving transit needs but an increasing number of pleasure trip passengers as the coastal beach resorts developed and grew crowded with vacationers in the next decades partly due to the improved swifter transportation with highway and bridges / tunnel access in the region of three states. [4]\\r\\nIn 1956, the General Assembly authorized the Ferry Commission to conduct feasibility studies for the construction of a fixed crossing. The conclusion of the study indicated that a vehicular crossing was feasible.[2]\\r\\nConsideration was given to service between the Eastern Shore and both the Peninsula and South Hampton Roads. Eventually, the shortest route, extending between the Eastern Shore and a point in Princess Anne County at Chesapeake Beach (east of Little Creek, west of Lynnhaven Inlet), was selected. An option to also provide a fixed crossing link to Hampton and the Peninsula was not pursued.[5]\\r\\nThe selected route crossed two Atlantic shipping channels: the Thimble Shoals Channel to Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake Channel to the northern Chesapeake Bay. High-level bridges were initially considered for traversing these channels. The United States Navy objected to bridging the Thimble Shoals Channel because a bridge collapse (possibly by sabotage) could cut Naval Station Norfolk off from the Atlantic Ocean. Maryland officials expressed similar concerns about the Chesapeake Channel and the Port of Baltimore.[6]\\r\\nTo address these concerns, the engineers recommended a series of bridges and tunnels known as a bridgeÿtunnel, similar in design to the Hampton Roads BridgeÿTunnel, which had been completed in 1957, but a considerably longer and larger facility. The tunnel portions, anchored by four man-made islands of approximately 5 acres (2.0?ha) each, would be extended under the two main shipping channels. The CBBT was designed by the engineering firm Sverdrup & Parcel of St. Louis, Missouri.[6]\\r\\nIn mid-1960, the Chesapeake Bay Ferry Commission sold $200 million in toll revenue bonds to private investors, and the proceeds were used to finance the construction of the bridgeÿtunnel. Funds collected by future tolls were pledged to pay the principal and interest on the bonds. No local, state, or federal tax funds were used in the construction of the project.\\r\\nConstruction contracts were awarded to a consortium of Tidewater Construction Corporation and Merritt-Chapman & Scott Corporation. The steel superstructure for the high-level bridges near the north end of the crossing were fabricated by the American Bridge Division of United States Steel Corporation. Construction of the bridgeÿtunnel began in October 1960 after a six-month process of assembling necessary equipment from worldwide sources.\\r\\nThe tunnels were constructed using the technique refined by Ole Singstad with the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, whereby a large ditch was first dug for each tunnel, into which was lowered pre-fabricated tunnel sections cable-suspended from overhead barges. Interior chambers were filled with water to lower the sections, the sections then aligned, bolted together by divers, the water pumped out, and the tunnels finally covered with earth.\\r\\nThe construction was accomplished under the severe conditions imposed by nor'easters, hurricanes, and the unpredictable Atlantic Ocean. During the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, much of the partially completed work and a major piece of custom-built equipment, a pile driver barge called \\"The Big D\\", were destroyed. Seven workers were killed at various times during the construction. In April 1964, 42 months after construction began, the Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel opened to traffic and the ferry service discontinued.\\r\\nThe Ferry Commission and transportation district it oversees, created in 1954, were later renamed for the revised mission of building and operating the Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel. The CBBT district is a public agency and it is a legal subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The bridgeÿtunnel is supported financially by the tolls collected from the motorists who use the facility.\\r\\nEastern Shore native, businessman, and civic leader Lucius J. Kellam Jr. (1911ÿ1995) was the original Commission's first chairman. In a commentary at the time of his death in 1995, the Norfolk-based Virginian-Pilot newspaper recalled that Kellam had been involved in bringing the multimillion-dollar bridgeÿtunnel project from dream to reality.\\r\\nBefore it was built, Kellam handled a political fight over the location, and addressed concerns of the U.S. Navy about prospective hazards to navigation to and from the Norfolk Navy Base at Sewell's Point.\\r\\nKellam was also directly involved in the negotiations to finance the ambitious crossing with bonds. According to the newspaper article, \\"there were not-unfounded fears that (1) storm-driven seas and drifting or off-course vessels could damage, if not destroy, the span and (2) traffic might not be sufficient to service the entire debt in an orderly way. Sure enough, bridge portions of the crossing have occasionally been damaged by vessels, and there was a long period when holders of the riskiest bonds received no interest on their investment.\\"\\r\\nAn icon of eastern Virginia politics, Kellam remained chairman and champion of the CBBT throughout the hard times, and the bondholders were eventually paid as toll revenues caught up with expenses. He continued to serve until he was over 80 years old, finally retiring in 1993. He had held the post for 39 years.\\r\\nThe facility was renamed in his honor in 1987, over 20 years after it was first opened to traffic.\\r\\nAt a cost of $197 million, new parallel two-lane trestles were built both to alleviate traffic and for safety reasons. Immediately after completion of the parallel trestles, traffic was diverted to them and the original trestles and roadway underwent a $20 million retrofit, repairing the wear and tear of 35 years of service and upgrading certain features, such as repaving the road surface. The older portion of the facility was then reopened on April 19, 1999.\\r\\nThe 1995ÿ1999 project increased the capacity of the above-water portion of the facility to four lanes, added wider shoulders for the new southbound portion, facilitated needed repairs, and provided protection against a total closure should a trestle be struck by a ship or otherwise damaged (which had occurred twice in the past); partially for this reason, the parallel trestles are not located immediately adjacent to each other, reducing the chance that both would be damaged during a single incident.\\r\\nConstruction is currently underway to add a second tunnel beside the existing tunnel located on the southern end (Thimble Shoals). The Tunnel Boring Machine is expected to be delivered to the site in 2018. After boring the machine will also be adding the circular concrete segments which will be delivered into the tunnel via mine cars one at a time.\\r\\nThe northern end, a parallel Chesapeake Channel Tunnel will be added to finish the entire length to become a four lane highway from shore to shore. This project is marked to begin in 2035, which would possibly be open for traffic in 2040, assuming there are no setbacks or delays.\\r\\nToll collection facilities are located at both ends of the facility. Tolls are paid in each direction. As of 2013, the toll for cars (without trailers) traveling along the CBBT is $15. Should a car make a return trip within 24 hours of the first, the second trip across costs $5. Motorcycles pay the same toll as cars without trailers. All other vehicles are charged based on size and purpose and are not subject to the return-trip discount.[7] All tolls must be paid either in cash, by scrip tickets issued by the CBBT, or via E-ZPass electronic toll collection.[8] The bridgeÿtunnel began accepting Smart Tag/E-ZPass payments on November 1, 2007.[9][10]\\r\\nAll toll lanes including E-ZPass-only lanes are gated for safety concerns and to turn around inadmissible vehicles. For example:[11]\\r\\nThe bridgeÿtunnel management prohibits bicycles but offers a shuttle van for $15. Cyclists must call ahead.[14]\\r\\nIt is mandatory that the bridge be checked and serviced every five years. Since servicing the bridge takes about five years, the work never stops.[15]\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel is one of only two automobile transportation facilities in Virginia that employs its own police department (the other is the Richmond Metropolitan Authority Toll Road Police). By original charter from the Commonwealth, it has authority to enforce the laws of Virginia.[16] Emergency call boxes are spaced every half-mile (.8?km) along the bridge. The toll schedule, weather advisories, and other information are available at the official website for the bridge.[17]\\r\\nThe CBBT promotes the bridgeÿtunnel as not only a transportation facility to tourist destinations to the north and south, but as a destination itself. For travelers headed elsewhere, the bridgeÿtunnel can save more than 90 miles (140?km) of driving for those headed between Ocean City, Maryland, Rehoboth Beach, Fenwick Island, and Wilmington, Delaware (and areas north) and the Virginia Beach area or the Outer Banks of North Carolina, according to the CBBT district. Unlike the Interstate highways that travelers would avoid by taking the bridgeÿtunnel, the roads in the shortcut have traffic lights.[17]\\r\\nOn the Delmarva peninsula to the north of the bridge, travelers may visit nearby Kiptopeke State Park, Eastern Shore National Wildlife Refuge, Fisherman Island National Wildlife Refuge (closed to the public), campgrounds and other vacation destinations. To the south are tourist destinations around Virginia Beach, including First Landing State Park, Norfolk Botanical Garden, Virginia Beach Maritime Historical Museum, Atlantic Wildfowl Heritage Museum, and the Virginia Aquarium and Maritime Science Center.[17]\\r\\nA scenic overlook is located at the north end of the bridge and was formerly located at South Thimble Island, near the south end. At South Thimble Island, passing ships may include U.S. Navy warships, nuclear submarines, and aircraft carriers, as well as large cargo vessels and sailing ships. A restaurant and gift shop on the island opened in 1964, along with the 625-foot-long (191?m) Sea Gull Pier. Bluefish, trout, croaker, flounder, and other species have been caught from the pier. Since birds use the habitat created by the bridges and islands of the CBBT, birders have travelled to the bridgeÿtunnel to see them at South Thimble Island and the scenic overlook at the north end.[17] As part of the Thimble Shoal Channel Tunnel twinning, the building housing the restaurant and gift shop closed and access to the pier was prohibited starting at the end of September 2017.[18] The building will be demolished and not replaced, and the pier will reopen to the public at the end of the project in 2022.[19]\\r\\nAmong the key features of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel are two 1-mile (1.6?km) tunnels beneath the Thimble Shoals and Chesapeake navigation channels and two pairs of side-by-side high-level bridges over two other navigation channels: North Channel Bridge (75?ft or 22.9?m clearance) and Fisherman Inlet Bridge (40?ft or 12.2?m clearance). The remaining portion comprises 12 miles (19?km) of low-level trestle, 2 miles (3.2?km) of causeway, and four man-made islands.\\r\\nThe CBBT is 17.6 miles (28.3?km) long from shore to shore, crossing what is essentially an ocean strait. Including land-approach highways, the overall facility is 23 miles (37?km) long (20 miles or 32 kilometres from toll-plaza to toll-plaza)[1] and despite its length, there is only a height difference of 6 inches (152?mm) from the south to north end of the bridgeÿtunnel.\\r\\nMan-made islands, each approximately 5.25 acres (2.12?ha) in size, are located at each end of the two tunnels. Between North Channel and Fisherman Inlet, the facility crosses at grade over Fisherman Island, a barrier island which is part of the Eastern Shore of Virginia National Wildlife Refuge administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\\r\\nThe columns that support the bridgeÿtunnel's trestles are called piles. If placed end to end, the piles would stretch for about 100 miles (160?km), roughly the distance from New York City to Philadelphia.[20]\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel has suffered three major ship accidents which caused the bridge tunnel system to be closed.\\r\\nThe first accident occurred in December 1967 when the Mohawk[21], a coal barge, broke anchor and struck the bridge, closing it for two weeks for repair.[22]\\r\\nOn January 21, 1970 the USS Yancey (AKA-93), a United States Navy attack cargo ship carrying 250 people[21], was at anchor near the bridge tunnel. During a gale with winds gusting in excess of 50 miles per hour (80?km/h), the Yancey dragged her anchors and hit the bridge stern first, knocking out a 375 foot (114?m) segment of trestle. There were no vehicles on the bridge at the time of the impact, and no one was injured during the incident. During the 42 days it took to replace the damaged span[22] the Navy offered a free shuttle service for commuters using helicopters and LCUs.[23]\\r\\nIn 1972, the bridge was again impacted by a barge which had broken loose, again closing the bridge-tunnel for two weeks while the span was repaired.[22]\\r\\nThe bridge-tunnel is frequently impacted by barges moving through the highly trafficked area; most incidents cause no damage and require a closure of the system for inspections before reopening. The most recent example of this was the September 2011 barge strike, which closed the bridge-tunnel for less than four hours.

It is usually considered to have started with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses by Martin Luther in 1517 and lasted until the end of the Thirty Years' War with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.\\r\\nAlthough there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther ÿ such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe ÿ Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety-five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as the only source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought.\\r\\nThe initial movement within Germany diversified, and other reform impulses arose independently of Luther. The spread of Gutenberg's printing press provided the means for the rapid dissemination of religious materials in the vernacular. The largest groups were the Lutherans and Calvinists. Lutheran churches were founded mostly in Germany, the Baltics and Scandinavia, while the Reformed ones were founded in Switzerland, Hungary, France, the Netherlands and Scotland. The movement influenced the Church of England decisively after 1547 under Edward VI and Elizabeth I, although the Church of England had been made independent under Henry VIII in the early 1530s.\\r\\nThere were also reformation movements throughout continental Europe known as the Radical Reformation, which gave rise to the Anabaptist, Moravian and other Pietistic movements. Radical Reformers, besides forming communities outside state sanction, often employed more extreme doctrinal change, such as the rejection of the tenets of the late antique councils of Nicaea and Chalcedon.\\r\\nThe Catholic Church responded with a Counter-Reformation initiated by the Council of Trent. Much work in battling Protestantism was done by the well-organised new order of the Jesuits. In general, Northern Europe, with the exception of most of Ireland, Poland and Lithuania, came under the influence of Protestantism. Southern Europe remained Catholic, while Central Europe was a site of a fierce conflict, culminating in the Thirty Years' War, which left it devastated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest Protestant churches, such as the Unitas Fratrum and Moravian Church, date their origins to Jan Hus (John Huss) in the early 15th century. As it was led by a Bohemian noble majority, and recognised, for a time, by the Basel Compacts, the Hussite Reformation was Europe's first \\"Magisterial Reformation\\" because the ruling magistrates supported it, unlike the \\"Radical Reformation\\", which the state did not support.\\r\\nThe later Protestant Churches generally date their doctrinal separation from the Catholic Church to the 16th century. The Reformation began as an attempt to reform the Catholic Church, by priests who opposed what they perceived as false doctrines and ecclesiastic malpractice. They especially objected to the teaching and the sale of indulgences, and the abuses thereof, and to simony, the selling and buying of clerical offices. The reformers saw these practices as evidence of the systemic corruption of the Church's hierarchy, which included the pope.\\r\\nUnrest due to the Great Schism of Western Christianity (1378ÿ1416) excited wars between princes, uprisings among the peasants, and widespread concern over corruption in the Church. New perspectives came from John Wycliffe at Oxford University and from Jan Hus at the Charles University in Prague. Hus objected to some of the practices of the Catholic Church and wanted to return the church in Bohemia and Moravia to earlier practices: liturgy in the language of the people (i.e. Czech), having lay people receive communion in both kinds (bread and wine ÿ that is, in Latin, communio sub utraque specie), married priests, and eliminating indulgences and the concept of Purgatory. Some of these, like the use of local language as the lithurgic language, were approved by the pope as early as in the 9th century.[1]\\r\\nHus rejected indulgences and adopted a doctrine of justification by grace through faith alone.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Catholic Church officially concluded this debate at the Council of Constance (1414ÿ1417) by condemning Hus, who was executed by burning despite a promise of safe-conduct.[2] Wycliffe was posthumously condemned as a heretic and his corpse exhumed and burned in 1428.[3] The Council of Constance confirmed and strengthened the traditional medieval conception of church and empire. The council did not address the national tensions or the theological tensions stirred up during the previous century and could not prevent schism and the Hussite Wars in Bohemia.[4][better?source?needed]\\r\\nPope Sixtus IV (1471ÿ1484) established the practice of selling indulgences to be applied to the dead, thereby establishing a new stream of revenue with agents across Europe.[5] Pope Alexander VI (1492ÿ1503) was one of the most controversial of the Renaissance popes. He was the father of seven children, including Lucrezia and Cesare Borgia.[6][better?source?needed] In response to papal corruption, particularly the sale of indulgences, Luther wrote The Ninety-Five Theses.[7][better?source?needed]\\r\\nThe Reformation is usually dated to 31 October 1517 in Wittenberg, Saxony, when Luther sent his Ninety-Five Theses on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences to the Archbishop of Mainz. The theses debated and criticised the Church and the papacy, but concentrated upon the selling of indulgences and doctrinal policies about purgatory, particular judgment, and the authority of the pope. He would later in the period 1517ÿ1521 write works on the Catholic devotion to Virgin Mary, the intercession of and devotion to the saints, the sacraments, mandatory clerical celibacy, monasticism, further on the authority of the pope, the ecclesiastical law, censure and excommunication, the role of secular rulers in religious matters, the relationship between Christianity and the law, and good works.[8]\\r\\nReformers made heavy use of inexpensive pamphlets as well as vernacular Bibles using the relatively new printing press, so there was swift movement of both ideas and documents.[9][10]\\r\\nParallel to events in Germany, a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Ulrich Zwingli. These two movements quickly agreed on most issues, but some unresolved differences kept them separate. Some followers of Zwingli believed that the Reformation was too conservative, and moved independently toward more radical positions, some of which survive among modern day Anabaptists. Other Protestant movements grew up along lines of mysticism or humanism, sometimes breaking from Rome or from the Protestants, or forming outside of the churches.\\r\\nAfter this first stage of the Reformation, following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope, the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland, Scotland, Hungary, Germany and elsewhere.\\r\\nThe Reformation foundations engaged with Augustinianism; both Luther and Calvin thought along lines linked with the theological teachings of Augustine of Hippo.[citation needed] The Augustinianism of the reformers struggled against Pelagianism, a heresy that they perceived in the Catholic Church. In the course of this religious upheaval, the German Peasants' War of 1524ÿ1525 swept through the Bavarian, Thuringian and Swabian principalities, including the Black Company of Florian Geier, a knight from Giebelstadt who joined the peasants in the general outrage against the Catholic hierarchy. Zwinglian and Lutheran ideas had influence with preachers within the regions that the Peasants' War occurred and upon works such as the Twelve Articles.[11] Luther, however, condemned the revolt in writings such as Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants; Zwingli and Luther's ally Philipp Melanchthon also did not condone the uprising.[12][13] Some 100,000 peasants were killed by the end of the war.[14]\\r\\nThe Radical Reformation was the response to what was believed to be the corruption in the Catholic Church and the expanding Magisterial Protestant movement led by Martin Luther and many others. Beginning in Germany and Switzerland in the 16th century, the Radical Reformation gave birth to many radical Protestant groups throughout Europe. The term covers radical reformers like Thomas Mntzer and Andreas Karlstadt, groups like the Zwickau prophets, and Anabaptist groups like the Hutterites and Mennonites.\\r\\nIn parts of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, a majority sympathized with the Radical Reformation despite intense persecution.[15] Although the surviving proportion of the European population that rebelled against Catholic, Lutheran and Zwinglian churches was small, Radical Reformers wrote profusely and the literature on the Radical Reformation is disproportionately large, partly as a result of the proliferation of the Radical Reformation teachings in the United States.[16]\\r\\nThe Reformation was a triumph of literacy and the new printing press.[17][a][9][19] Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward, religious pamphlets flooded Germany and much of Europe.[20][b]\\r\\nBy 1530, over 10,000 publications are known, with a total of ten million copies. The Reformation was thus a media revolution. Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a \\"good\\" against \\"bad\\" church. From there, it became clear that print could be used for propaganda in the Reformation for particular agendas. Reform writers used pre-Reformation styles, clichs and stereotypes and changed items as needed for their own purposes.[20] Especially effective were writings in German, including Luther's translation of the Bible, his Smaller Catechism for parents teaching their children, and his Larger Catechism, for pastors.\\r\\nUsing the German vernacular they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. Illustrations in the German Bible and in many tracts popularised Luther's ideas. Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472ÿ1553), the great painter patronised by the electors of Wittenberg, was a close friend of Luther, and he illustrated Luther's theology for a popular audience. He dramatised Luther's views on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, while remaining mindful of Luther's careful distinctions about proper and improper uses of visual imagery.[22]\\r\\nThe following supply-side factors have been identified as causes of the Reformation:[23]\\r\\nThe following demand-side factors have been identified as causes of the Reformation:[23]\\r\\nThe Reformation also spread widely throughout Europe, starting with Bohemia (Czech Lands) yet before Luther and over the next few decades also other countries.\\r\\nAustria followed the same pattern of the German-speaking states within the Holy Roman Empire, and Lutheranism became the main Protestant confession among its population. Lutheranism gained a significant following in Austria which was concentrated in the eastern half of present-day Austria, while Calvinism was less successful. Eventually the adoption of the Counter-Reformation reversed the trend.\\r\\nThe Hussites were a Christian movement in the Kingdom of Bohemia following the teachings of Czech reformer Jan Hus.\\r\\nCzech reformer and university professor Jan Hus (c. 1369ÿ1415) became the best-known representative of the Bohemian Reformation and one of the forerunners of the Protestant Reformation.\\r\\nJan Hus was declared heretic and executed ÿ burned at stake ÿ at the Council of Constance in 1415 where he arrived voluntarily to defend his teachings.\\r\\nThis predominantly religious movement was propelled by social issues and strengthened Czech national awareness. In 1417, two years after the execution of Jan Hus, the Czech reformation quickly became the chief force in the country.\\r\\nHussites made up the vast majority of the population, forcing the Council of Basel to recognize in 1437 a system of two \\"religions\\" for the first time signing the Compacts of Basel for the kingdom (Catholic and Czech Ultraquism, a Hussite movement). Bohemia later also elected two Protestant kings (George of Podbrady).\\r\\nAfter Habsburgs took control of the region, the Hussite churches were prohibited and the kingdom partially recatholicized. Even later Lutheranism gained a substantial following, after being permitted by the Habsburgs with the continued persecution of the Czech native Hussite churches. Many Hussites thus declared themselves Lutherans .\\r\\nTwo churches with Hussite roots are now second and third biggest churches in the predominantly agnostic country: Czech Brethren (which gave origin to the international church known as the Moravian Church) and Czechoslovak Hussite Church.\\r\\nIn Switzerland, the teachings of the reformers and especially those of Zwingli and Calvin had a profound effect, despite the frequent quarrels between the different branches of the Reformation.\\r\\nParallel to events in Germany, a movement began in the Swiss Confederation under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher who moved to Zurich ÿ the then-leading city state ÿ in 1518, a year after Martin Luther began the Reformation in Germany with his Ninety-five Theses. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, as the recently introduced printing press spread ideas rapidly from place to place, some unresolved differences kept them separate. Long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. Although Zwinglianism does hold uncanny resemblance to Lutheranism (it even had its own equivalent of the Ninety-five Theses, called the 67 Conclusions), historians have been unable to prove that Zwingli had any contact with Luther's publications before 1520, and Zwingli himself maintained that he had prevented himself from reading them.\\r\\nThe German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther, seeing strength in a united Protestant front. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the Colloquy of Marburg, which has become infamous for its complete failure. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine. Although Luther preached consubstantiation in the Eucharist over transubstantiation, he believed in the spiritual presence of Christ at the Mass. Zwingli, inspired by Dutch theologian Cornelius Hoen, believed that the mass was only representative and memorial ÿ Christ was not present.[30] Luther became so angry that he famously carved into the meeting table in chalk Hoc Est Corpus Meum ÿ a Biblical quotation from the Last Supper meaning 'This is my body'. Zwingli countered this saying that est in that context was the equivalent of the word significant (signifies).[31]\\r\\nSome followers of Zwingli believed that the Reformation was too conservative and moved independently toward more radical positions, some of which survive among modern day Anabaptists. One famous incident illustrating this was when radical Zwinglians fried and ate sausages during Lent in Zurich city square by way of protest against the Church teaching of good works. Other Protestant movements grew up along the lines of mysticism or humanism (cf. Erasmus), sometimes breaking from Rome or from the Protestants, or forming outside of the churches.\\r\\nFollowing the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope, the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland, Scotland, Hungary, Germany and elsewhere. After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526, and the unsuccessful attempts of the Berne reformer Guillaume (William) Farel, Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the \\"fallen city\\" of Geneva. His \\"Ordinances\\" of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life. After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559, Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement, providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries. These missionaries dispersed Calvinism widely, and formed the French Huguenots in Calvin's own lifetime, as well as causing the conversion of Scotland under the leadership of the cantankerous John Knox in 1560. The faith continued to spread after Calvin's death in 1563 and reached as far as Constantinople by the start of the 17th century.\\r\\nThe Reformation foundations engaged with Augustinianism. Both Luther and Calvin thought along lines linked with the theological teachings of Augustine of Hippo. The Augustinianism of the Reformers struggled against Pelagianism, a heresy that they perceived in the Catholic Church of their day. Unfortunately, since Calvin and Luther disagreed strongly on certain matters of theology (such as double-predestination and Holy Communion), the relationship between Lutherans and Calvinists was one of conflict.\\r\\nAll of Scandinavia ultimately adopted Lutheranism over the course of the 16th century, as the monarchs of Denmark (who also ruled Norway and Iceland) and Sweden (who also ruled Finland) converted to that faith.\\r\\nIn Sweden, the Reformation was spearheaded by Gustav Vasa, elected king in 1523. Friction with the pope over the latter's interference in Swedish ecclesiastical affairs led to the discontinuance of any official connection between Sweden and the papacy from 1523. Four years later, at the Diet of V?ster?s, the king succeeded in forcing the diet to accept his dominion over the national church. The king was given possession of all church property, church appointments required royal approval, the clergy were subject to the civil law, and the \\"pure Word of God\\" was to be preached in the churches and taught in the schools ÿ effectively granting official sanction to Lutheran ideas.\\r\\nUnder the reign of Frederick I (1523ÿ33), Denmark remained officially Catholic. But though Frederick initially pledged to persecute Lutherans, he soon adopted a policy of protecting Lutheran preachers and reformers, of whom the most famous was Hans Tausen. During his reign, Lutheranism made significant inroads among the Danish population. Frederick's son, Christian, was openly Lutheran, which prevented his election to the throne upon his father's death. In 1536, the authority of the Catholic bishops was terminated by national assembly. The next year, following his victory in the Count's War, he became king as Christian III and continued the Reformation of the state church with assistance of Johannes Bugenhagen.\\r\\nLuther's influence had already reached Iceland before King Christian's decree. The Germans fished near Iceland's coast, and the Hanseatic League engaged in commerce with the Icelanders. These Germans raised a Lutheran church in Hafnarfj?reur as early as 1533. Through German trade connections, many young Icelanders studied in Hamburg.[32] In 1538, when the kingly decree of the new Church ordinance reached Iceland, bishop ?gmundur and his clergy denounced it, threatening excommunication for anyone subscribing to the German 'heresy'.[33] In 1539, the King sent a new governor to Iceland, Klaus von Mervitz, with a mandate to introduce reform and take possession of church property.[33] Von Mervitz seized a monastery in Vieey with the help of his sheriff, Dietrich of Minden, and his soldiers. They drove the monks out and seized all their possessions, for which they were promptly excommunicated by ?gmundur.\\r\\nThe separation of the Church of England from Rome under Henry VIII, beginning in 1529 and completed in 1537, brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement; however, religious changes in the English national church proceeded more conservatively than elsewhere in Europe. Reformers in the Church of England alternated, for decades, between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing, within the context of robustly Protestant doctrine, a tradition considered a middle way (via media) between the Catholic and Protestant traditions.\\r\\nThe English Reformation followed a different course from the Reformation in continental Europe. There had long been a strong strain of anti-clericalism. England had already given rise to the Lollard movement of John Wycliffe, which played an important part in inspiring the Hussites in Bohemia. Lollardy was suppressed and became an underground movement, so the extent of its influence in the 1520s is difficult to assess. The different character of the English Reformation came rather from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII.\\r\\nHenry had once been a sincere Catholic and had even authored a book strongly criticising Luther. His wife, Catherine of Aragon, bore him only a single child that survived infancy, Mary. Henry strongly wanted a male heir, and many of his subjects might have agreed, if only because they wanted to avoid another dynastic conflict like the Wars of the Roses.\\r\\nKing Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as \\"the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England\\".[34] Between 1535 and 1540, under Thomas Cromwell, the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect. The veneration of some saints, certain pilgrimages and some pilgrim shrines were also attacked. Huge amounts of church land and property passed into the hands of the Crown and ultimately into those of the nobility and gentry. The vested interest thus created made for a powerful force in support of the dissolutions.\\r\\nThere were some notable opponents to the Henrician Reformation, such as Thomas More and Cardinal John Fisher, who were executed for their opposition. There was also a growing party of reformers who were imbued with the Calvinistic, Lutheran and Zwinglian doctrines now current on the Continent. When Henry died he was succeeded by his Protestant son Edward VI, who, through his empowered councillors (with the King being only nine years old at his succession and fifteen at his death) the Duke of Somerset and the Duke of Northumberland, ordered the destruction of images in churches, and the closing of the chantries. Under Edward VI the Church of England moved closer to continental Protestantism.\\r\\nYet, at a popular level, religion in England was still in a state of flux. Following a brief Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary (1553ÿ1558), a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I, though this point is one of considerable debate among historians. This \\"Elizabethan Religious Settlement\\" largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on one hand and Catholicism on the other. But compared to the bloody and chaotic state of affairs in contemporary France, it was relatively successful, in part because Queen Elizabeth lived so long, until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the 17th century.\\r\\nThe success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age, although it was not until the 1640s that England underwent religious strife comparable to what its neighbours had suffered some generations before.\\r\\nThe early Puritan movement (late 16thÿ17th centuries) was Reformed or Calvinist and was a movement for reform in the Church of England. Its origins lay in the discontent with the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially Geneva. The Puritans objected to ornaments and ritual in the churches as idolatrous (vestments, surplices, organs, genuflection), which they castigated as \\"popish pomp and rags\\". (See Vestments controversy.) They also objected to ecclesiastical courts. Their refusal to endorse completely all of the ritual directions and formulas of the Book of Common Prayer and the imposition of its liturgical order by legal force and inspection sharpened Puritanism into a definite opposition movement.\\r\\nThe later Puritan movement, often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists, eventually led to the formation of various reformed denominations.\\r\\nThe most famous emigration to America was the migration of Puritan separatists from the Anglican Church of England. They fled first to Holland, and then later to America to establish the English colony of Massachusetts in New England, which later became one of the original United States. These Puritan separatists were also known as \\"the Pilgrims\\". After establishing a colony at Plymouth (which became part of the colony of Massachusetts) in 1620, the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the King of England that legitimised their colony, allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England, in accordance with the principles of mercantilism. The Puritans persecuted those of other religious faiths.[35] Quaker Mary Dyer was hanged in Boston for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony.[36] She was one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs. Executions ceased in 1661 when King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism.[37] In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law prohibiting any Jesuit Roman Catholic priests from entering territory under Puritan jurisdiction.[38] Any suspected person who could not clear himself was to be banished from the colony; a second offense carried a death penalty.[39]\\r\\nThe Pilgrims held radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas, and its celebration was outlawed in Boston from 1659 to 1681.[40] The ban was revoked in 1681 by the English-appointed governor Edmund Andros, who also revoked a Puritan ban on festivities on Saturday nights.[40] Nevertheless, it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.[41]\\r\\nBishop Richard Davies and dissident Protestant cleric John Penry introduced Calvinist theology to Wales. In 1588, the Bishop of Llandaff published the entire Bible into the Welsh language. The translation had a significant impact upon the Welsh population and helped to firmly establish Protestantism among the Welsh people.[42] The Welsh Protestants used the model of the Synod of Dort of 1618ÿ1619. Calvinism developed through the Puritan period, following the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, and within Wales' Calvinistic Methodist movement. However few copies of Calvin's were available before mid 19th century.[43]\\r\\nThe Reformation in Scotland's case culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along reformed lines, and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France. John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish reformation.\\r\\nThe Reformation Parliament of 1560 repudiated the pope's authority by the Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560, forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith. It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent Mary of Guise, who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter Mary, Queen of Scots (then also Queen of France).\\r\\nAlthough Protestantism triumphed relatively easily in Scotland, the exact form of Protestantism remained to be determined. The 17th century saw a complex struggle between Presbyterianism (particularly the Covenanters) and Episcopalianism. The Presbyterians eventually won control of the Church of Scotland, which went on to have an important influence on Presbyterian churches worldwide, but Scotland retained a relatively large Episcopalian minority.\\r\\nProtestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots; this eventually led to decades of civil warfare.\\r\\nThough not personally interested in religious reform, Francis I (reigned 1515ÿ1547) initially maintained an attitude of tolerance, in accordance with his interest in the humanist movement. This changed in 1534 with the Affair of the Placards. In this act, Protestants denounced the Catholic Mass in placards that appeared across France, even reaching the royal apartments. The issue of religious faith having been thrown into the arena of politics, Francis came to view the movement as a threat to the kingdom's stability. This led to the first major phase of anti-Protestant persecution in France, in which the Chambre Ardente (\\"Burning Chamber\\") was established (1535) within the Parlement of Paris to deal with the rise in prosecutions for heresy. Several thousand French Protestants fled the country, most notably John Calvin, who emigrated to Basel in 1535 before eventually settling in Geneva in 1536.\\r\\nCalvin continued to take an interest in the religious affairs of his native land and, from his base in Geneva, beyond the reach of the French kings, regularly trained pastors to lead congregations in France. Despite heavy persecution by King Henry II of France (reigned 1547ÿ1559), the Reformed Church of France, largely Calvinist in direction, made steady progress across large sections of the nation, in the urban bourgeoisie and parts of the aristocracy, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment.\\r\\nFrench Protestantism, though its appeal increased under persecution, came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of destructive and intermittent conflicts, known as the Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II in 1559, which began a prolonged period of weakness for the French crown. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars only concluded when Henry IV, himself a former Huguenot, issued the Edict of Nantes (1598), promising official toleration of the Protestant minority, but under highly restricted conditions. Catholicism remained the official state religion, and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in Louis XIV's Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Catholicism the sole legal religion of France. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg declared the Edict of Potsdam (October 1685), giving free passage to Huguenot refugees and tax-free status to them for ten years.\\r\\nIn the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and the English and Dutch overseas colonies. A significant community in France remained in the Cvennes region. A separate Protestant community, of the Lutheran faith, existed in the newly conquered (1639ÿ ) province of Alsace, its status not affected by the Edict of Fontainebleau.\\r\\nIn the early 16th century, Spain had a different political and cultural milieu from its Western and Central European neighbors in several respects, which affected the mentality and the reaction of the nation towards the Reformation. Spain, which had only recently managed to complete the reconquest of the Peninsula from the Moors in 1492, had been preoccupied with converting the Muslim and Jewish population of the newly conquered regions through the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition in 1478. The rulers of the nation stressed political, cultural, and religious unity, and by the time of the Lutheran Reformation, the Spanish Inquisition was already 40 years old and had the capability of quickly dealing with any new movement that the Catholic Church perceived or interpreted to be religious heterodoxy.[44] Charles V did not wish to see Spain or the rest of Habsburg Europe divided, and in light of continual threat from the Ottomans, preferred to see the Catholic Church reform itself from within. This led to a Counter-Reformation in Spain in the 1530s. During the 1520s, the Spanish Inquisition had created an atmosphere of suspicion and sought to root out any religious thought seen as suspicious. As early as 1521, the Pope had written a letter to the Spanish monarchy warning against allowing the unrest in Northern Europe to be replicated in Spain. Between 1520 and 1550, printing presses in Spain were tightly controlled and any books of Protestant teaching were prohibited.\\r\\nBetween 1530 and 1540, Protestantism in Spain was still able to gain followers clandestinely, and in cities such as Seville and Valladolid adherents would secretly meet at private houses to pray and study the Bible.[45] Protestants in Spain were estimated at between 1000 and 3000, mainly among intellectuals who had seen writings such as those of Erasmus. Notable reformers included Dr. Juan Gil and Juan Prez de Pineda who subsequently fled and worked alongside others such as Francisco de Enzinas to translate the Greek New Testament into the Spanish language, a task completed by 1556. Protestant teachings were smuggled into Spain by Spaniards such as Julin Hernndez, who in 1557 was condemned by the Inquisition and burnt at the stake. Under Philip II, conservatives in the Spanish church tightened their grip, and those who refused to recant such as Rodrigo de Valer were condemned to life imprisonment. In May 1559, sixteen Spanish Lutherans were burnt at the stake: fourteen were strangled before being burnt, while two were burnt alive. In October another thirty were executed. Spanish Protestants who were able to flee the country were to be found in at least a dozen cities in Europe, such as Geneva, where some of them embraced Calvinist teachings. Those who fled to England were given support by the Church of England.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Navarre, although by the time of the Protestant Reformation a minor principality territorially restricted to southern France, had French Huguenot monarchs, including Henry IV of France and his mother, Jeanne III of Navarre, a devout Calvinist.\\r\\nUpon the arrival of the Protestant Reformation, Calvinism reached some Basques through the translation of the Bible into the Basque language by Joanes Leizarraga. As Queen of Navarre, Jeanne III commissioned the translation of the New Testament into Basque[c] and Barnese for the benefit of her subjects.\\r\\nThe Reformation did not succeed in Portugal, as its spread was frustrated for similar reasons to those in Spain.\\r\\nThe Reformation in the Netherlands, unlike in many other countries, was not initiated by the rulers of the Seventeen Provinces, but instead by multiple popular movements, which in turn were bolstered by the arrival of Protestant refugees from other parts of the continent. While the Anabaptist movement enjoyed popularity in the region in the early decades of the Reformation, Calvinism, in the form of the Dutch Reformed Church, became the dominant Protestant faith in the country from the 1560s onward.\\r\\nHarsh persecution of Protestants by the Spanish government of Philip II contributed to a desire for independence in the provinces, which led to the Eighty Years' War and, eventually, the separation of the largely Protestant Dutch Republic from the Catholic-dominated Southern Netherlands (present-day Belgium).\\r\\nLuxembourg, a part of the Spanish Netherlands, remained Catholic.\\r\\nMuch of the population of the Kingdom of Hungary adopted Protestantism during the 16th century. After the 1526 Battle of Mohcs, the Hungarian people were disillusioned by the inability of the government to protect them and turned to the faith they felt would infuse them with the strength necessary to resist the invader. They found this in the teaching of Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther. The spread of Protestantism in the country was assisted by its large ethnic German minority, which could understand and translate the writings of Martin Luther. While Lutheranism gained a foothold among the German- and Slovak-speaking populations, Calvinism became widely accepted among ethnic Hungarians.\\r\\nIn the more independent northwest, the rulers and priests, protected now by the Habsburg Monarchy, which had taken the field to fight the Turks, defended the old Catholic faith. They dragged the Protestants to prison and the stake wherever they could. Such strong measures only fanned the flames of protest, however. Leaders of the Protestants included Mtys Dvai Br܇, Mihly Sztrai, Istvn Szegedi Kis, and Ferenc Dvid.\\r\\nProtestants likely formed a majority of Hungary's population at the close of the 16th century, but Counter-Reformation efforts in the 17th century reconverted a majority of the kingdom to Catholicism. A significant Protestant minority remained, most of it adhering to the Calvinist faith.\\r\\nIn 1558 the Transylvanian Diet of Turda decreed the free practice of both the Catholic and Lutheran religions, but prohibited Calvinism. Ten years later, in 1568, the Diet extended this freedom, declaring that \\"It is not allowed to anybody to intimidate anybody with captivity or expulsion for his religion\\". Four religions were declared to be \\"accepted\\" (recepta) religions (the fourth being Unitarianism, which became official in 1583 as the faith of the only Unitarian king, John II Sigismund Zpolya, r. 1540ÿ1571), while Eastern Orthodox Christianity was \\"tolerated\\" (though the building of stone Orthodox churches was forbidden). During the Thirty Years' War, Royal (Habsburg) Hungary joined the Catholic side, until Transylvania joined the Protestant side.\\r\\nBetween 1604 and 1711, there was a series of anti-Habsburg uprisings calling for equal rights and freedom for all Christian denominations, with varying success; the uprisings were usually organised from Transylvania. The Habsburg-sanctioned Counter-Reformation efforts in the 17th century reconverted the majority of the kingdom to Catholicism.\\r\\nThe centre of Protestant learning in Hungary has for some centuries been the University of Debrecen. Founded in 1538, the University was situated in an area of Eastern Hungary under Ottoman Turkish rule during the 1600s and 1700s, being allowed Islamic toleration and thus avoiding Counter-Reformation persecution.\\r\\nThe Reformation in Ireland was a movement for the reform of religious life and institutions that was introduced into Ireland by the English administration at the behest of King Henry VIII of England. His desire for an annulment of his marriage was known as the King's Great Matter. Ultimately Pope Clement VII refused the petition; consequently it became necessary for the King to assert his lordship over the Catholic Church in his realm to give legal effect to his wishes. The English Parliament confirmed the King's supremacy over the Church in the Kingdom of England. This challenge to Papal supremacy resulted in a breach with the Catholic Church. By 1541, the Irish Parliament had agreed to the change in status of the country from that of a Lordship to that of Kingdom of Ireland.\\r\\nUnlike similar movements for religious reform on the continent of Europe, the various phases of the English Reformation as it developed in Ireland were largely driven by changes in government policy, to which public opinion in England gradually accommodated itself. However, a number of factors complicated the adoption of the religious innovations in Ireland; the majority of the population there adhered to the Catholic Church. However, in the city of Dublin the reformation took hold under the auspices of George Browne.\\r\\nWord of the Protestant reformers reached Italy in the 1520s but never caught on. Its development was stopped by the Counter-Reformation, the Inquisition and also popular disinterest. Not only was the Church highly aggressive in seeking out and suppressing heresy, but there was a shortage of Protestant leadership. No one translated the Bible into Italian; few tracts were written. No core of Protestantism emerged. The few preachers who did take an interest in \\"Lutheranism,\\" as it was called in Italy, were suppressed or went into exile to northern countries where their message was well received. As a result, the Reformation exerted almost no lasting influence in Italy, except for strengthening the Catholic Church and motivating the Counter-Reformation.[46][47]\\r\\nSome Protestants left Italy and became outstanding activists of the European Reformation, mainly in the PolishÿLithuanian Commonwealth (e.g. Giorgio Biandrata, Bernardino Ochino, Giovanni Alciato, Giovanni Battista Cetis, Fausto Sozzini, Francesco Stancaro and Giovanni Valentino Gentile), who propagated Nontrinitarianism there and were chief instigators of the movement of Polish Brethren.[48]\\r\\nIn 1532 the Waldensians adhered to the Reformation, adopting the Calvinist theology. The Waldensian Church survived in the Western Alps through many persecutions and remains a Protestant church in Italy.[49]\\r\\nIn the first half of the 16th century, the enormous PolishÿLithuanian Commonwealth was a country of many creeds, but Catholicism remained the dominating religion. Reformation reached Poland in the 1520s and quickly gained popularity among mostly German-speaking inhabitants of such major cities as Gdask, Toru and Elbl?g. In Koenigsberg, in 1530, a Polish-language edition of Luther's Small Catechism was published. The Duchy of Prussia, which was a Polish fief, emerged as a key center of the movement, with numerous publishing houses issuing not only Bibles, but also catechisms, in German, Polish and Lithuanian.\\r\\nLutheranism gained popularity in the northern part of the country, while Calvinism caught the interest of the nobility (known as szlachta), mainly in Lesser Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Several publishing houses were opened in Lesser Poland in the mid-16th century in such locations as S?omniki and Rak܇w. At that time, Mennonites and Czech Brothers came to Poland, with the latter settling mostly in Greater Poland around Leszno. In 1565, the Polish Brethren appeared as yet another reformation movement.\\r\\nThe Commonwealth was unique in Europe in the 16th century for its widespread tolerance confirmed by the Warsaw Confederation. In 1563, the Brest Bible was published (see also Bible translations into Polish). The period of tolerance ended during the reign of King Sigismund III Vasa, who was under the strong influence of Piotr Skarga and other Jesuits. After the Deluge, and other wars of the mid-17th century in which all enemies of Poland were either Protestant or Orthodox Christians, the Poles' attitude changed, and the Counter-Reformation prevailed: in 1658 the Polish Brethren were forced to leave the country, and in 1666, the Sejm banned apostasy from Catholicism to any other religion, under punishment of death. Finally, in 1717, the Silent Sejm banned non-Catholics from becoming deputies of the Parliament.\\r\\nAmong most important Protestants of the Commonwealth were Miko?aj Rej, Marcin Czechowic, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski and Symon Budny.\\r\\nPrimo? Trubar is notable for consolidating the Slovene language and is considered to be the key figure of Slovenian cultural history and in many aspects a major Slovene historical personality.[50] He was the key figure of the Protestant Church of the Slovene Lands, as he was its founder and its first superintendent. The first books in Slovene, Catechismus and Abecedarium, were written by Trubar.[51]\\r\\nLutheranism reached northern parts of the country.\\r\\nVojvodina turned partially Lutheran.\\r\\nThe Protestant teachings of the Western Church were also briefly adopted within the Eastern Orthodox Church through the Greek Patriarch Cyril Lucaris in 1629 with the publishing of the Confessio (Calvinistic doctrine) in Geneva. Motivating factors in their decision to adopt aspects of the Reformation included the historical rivalry and mistrust between the Greek Orthodox and Catholic church along with their concerns of Jesuit priests entering Greek lands in their attempts to propagate the teachings of the Counter-Reformation to the Greek populace. He subsequently sponsored Maximos of Gallipoli's translation of the New Testament into the Modern Greek language and was published in Geneva in 1638. Upon Lucaris's death in 1638, the conservative factions within the Eastern Orthodox Church held two synods: the Synod of Constantinople (1638) and Synod of Jassy (1642) criticizing the reforms and in the 1672 convocation led by Dositheos, they officially condemned the Calvinistic doctrines.\\r\\nThe Reformation spread throughout Europe beginning in 1517, reaching its peak between 1545 and 1620, and ending in 1648.\\r\\nThe high point of the Reformation occurred at some point between 1545 and 1620. In 1545, it was first considered a serious threat to the Catholic Church and the Papacy at the Council of Trent, prompting counterreformational measures by Catholic religious hierarchy. In 1620, the Battle of White Mountain put an end to Protestantism in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). The Thirty Years' War began in 1618 and brought a drastic territorial and demographic decline when the House of Habsburg introduced counterreformational measures throughout their vast possessions in Central Europe.\\r\\nIn 1545, the Council of Trent officially launched the Counter-Reformation against Protestantism in Europe to restore unity in the Catholic Church. This effort concluded in 1648, as did the Reformation itself. Common historical consensus holds that the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation both ended in 1648, when the Thirty Years' War concluded with the Peace of Westphalia.\\r\\nThere is no universal agreement on the exact or approximate date the Reformation ended. Various interpretations emphasize different dates, entire periods, or argue that the Reformation never really ended. However, there are a few popular interpretations that are used by large groups of observers.\\r\\nThe Reformation led to a series of religious wars that culminated in the Thirty Years' War (1618ÿ1648), which devastated much of Germany, killing between 25% and 40% of its entire population.[52] Catholic House of Habsburg and its allies fought against the Protestant princes of Germany, supported at various times by Denmark, Sweden and France. The Habsburgs, who ruled Spain, Austria, the Crown of Bohemia, Hungary, Slovene Lands, the Spanish Netherlands and much of Germany and Italy, were staunch defenders of the Catholic Church. Some historians believe that the era of the Reformation came to a close when Catholic France allied itself with Protestant states against the Habsburg dynasty. For the first time since the days of Martin Luther, political and national convictions again outweighed religious convictions in Europe.\\r\\nTwo main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War, were:\\r\\nThe treaty also effectively ended the Papacy's pan-European political power. Pope Innocent X declared the treaty \\"null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times\\" in his bull Zelo Domus Dei. European sovereigns, Catholic and Protestant alike, ignored his verdict.[53]\\r\\nThe following outcomes of the Reformation regarding human capital formation, the Protestant ethic, economic development, governance, and \\"dark\\" outcomes have been identified by scholars:[23]\\r\\nMargaret C. Jacob argues that there has been a dramatic shift in the historiography of the Reformation. Until the 1960s, historians focused their attention largely on the great leaders and theologians of the 16th century, especially Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli. Their ideas were studied in depth. However, the rise of the new social history in the 1960s look at history from the bottom up, not from the top down. Historians began to concentrate on the values, beliefs and behavior of the people at large. She finds, \\"in contemporary scholarship, the Reformation is now seen as a vast cultural upheaval, a social and popular movement, textured and rich because of its diversity.\\"[81]\\r\\nPartly due to Martin Luther's love for music, music became important in Lutheranism. The study and practice of music was encouraged in Protestant countries. Songs such as the Lutheran hymns, or the Calvinist Psalter became tools for the spread of Protestant ideas and beliefs, as well as identity flags. Similar attitudes developed among Catholics, who in turn encouraged the creation and use of music for religious purposes.[82]","input":"Who were the major figures in the reformation?"},{"output":"around 1.5 billion years ago","context":"The evolution of fungi has been going on since fungi diverged from other life around 1.5 billion years ago, (Wang et al., 1999)[1] with the glomaleans branching from the \\"higher fungi\\" at ~570?million years ago, according to DNA analysis. (Schssler et al., 2001; Tehler et al., 2000)[1] Fungi probably colonized the land during the Cambrian, over 500?million years ago, (Taylor & Osborn, 1996)[1] but terrestrial fossils only become uncontroversial and common during the Devonian, 400?million years ago.[1]\\r\\nA rich diversity of fungi is known from the lower Devonian Rhynie chert; an earlier record is absent. Since fungi do not biomineralise, they do not readily enter the fossil record; there are only three claims of early fungi. One from the Ordovician[2] has been dismissed on the grounds that it lacks any distinctly fungal features, and is held by many to be contamination;[3] the position of a \\"probable\\" Proterozoic fungus is still not established,[3] and it may represent a stem group fungus. There is also a case for a fungal affinity for the enigmatic microfossil Ornatifilum. Since the fungi form a sister group to the animals, the two lineages must have diverged before the first animal lineages, which are known from fossils as early as the Ediacaran.[4]\\r\\nIn contrast to plants and animals, the early fossil record of the fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of fungal fruiting bodies, which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which therefore are not readily evident. Fungal fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble extant fungi.[5] Often recovered from a permineralized plant or animal host, these samples are typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with light microscopy or transmission electron microscopy.[6] Compression fossils are studied by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using light or scanning electron microscopy to examine surface details.[7]\\r\\nThe earliest fossils possessing features typical of fungi date to the Paleoproterozoic era, some 2,400?million years ago (Ma); these multicellular benthic organisms had filamentous structures capable of anastomosis, in which hyphal branches recombine.[8] Other recent studies (2009) estimate the arrival of fungal organisms at about 760ÿ1060?Ma on the basis of comparisons of the rate of evolution in closely related groups.[9] For much of the Paleozoic Era (542ÿ251?Ma), the fungi appear to have been aquatic and consisted of organisms similar to the extant Chytrids in having flagellum-bearing spores.[10] Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the flagellum was lost early in the evolutionary history of the fungi, and consequently, the majority of fungal species lack a flagellum.[11] The evolutionary adaptation from an aquatic to a terrestrial lifestyle necessitated a diversification of ecological strategies for obtaining nutrients, including parasitism, saprobism, and the development of mutualistic relationships such as mycorrhiza and lichenization.[12] Recent (2009) studies suggest that the ancestral ecological state of the Ascomycota was saprobism, and that independent lichenization events have occurred multiple times.[13]\\r\\nThe fungi probably colonized the land during the Cambrian (542ÿ488.3?Ma), long before land plants.[1] Fossilized hyphae and spores recovered from the Ordovician of Wisconsin (460 Ma) resemble modern-day Glomerales, and existed at a time when the land flora likely consisted of only non-vascular bryophyte-like plants.[14] Prototaxites, which was probably a fungus or lichen, would have been the tallest organism of the late Silurian. Fungal fossils do not become common and uncontroversial until the early Devonian (416ÿ359.2?Ma), when they are abundant in the Rhynie chert, mostly as Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota.[1][15][16] At about this same time, approximately 400?Ma, the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota diverged,[17] and all modern classes of fungi were present by the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian, 318.1ÿ299?Ma).[18]\\r\\nLichen-like fossils have been found in the Doushantuo Formation in southern China dating back to 635ÿ551?Ma.[19] Lichens were a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems, and the estimated age of the oldest terrestrial lichen fossil is 400?Ma;[20] this date corresponds to the age of the oldest known sporocarp fossil, a Paleopyrenomycites species found in the Rhynie Chert.[21] The oldest fossil with microscopic features resembling modern-day basidiomycetes is Palaeoancistrus, found permineralized with a fern from the Pennsylvanian.[22] Rare in the fossil record are the homobasidiomycetes (a taxon roughly equivalent to the mushroom-producing species of the agaricomycetes). Two amber-preserved specimens provide evidence that the earliest known mushroom-forming fungi (the extinct species Archaeomarasmius legletti) appeared during the mid-Cretaceous, 90?Ma.[23][24]\\r\\nSome time after the Permian-Triassic extinction event (251.4?Ma), a fungal spike (originally thought to be an extraordinary abundance of fungal spores in sediments) formed, suggesting that fungi were the dominant life form at this time, representing nearly 100% of the available fossil record for this period.[25] However, the relative proportion of fungal spores relative to spores formed by algal species is difficult to assess,[26] the spike did not appear worldwide,[27][28] and in many places it did not fall on the Permian-Triassic boundary.[29]","input":"When did the first fungi appear on earth?"},{"output":"Shivraj Singh Chouhan","context":"The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh (MP), a central Indian state, is the head of the Government of Madhya Pradesh.

Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch continue to criticize the Saudi government for its violations of human rights.[24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMohammad bin Salman Al Saud was born on 31 August 1985.[1][2][3][27] He is the son of King Salman from his third spouse,[28] Fahda bint Falah bin Sultan bin Hathleen.[1] She is the granddaughter of Rakan bin Hithalayn, who was the head of the Al Ajman tribe.[29]\\r\\nPrince Mohammad bin Salman is the eldest among his mother's children;[28] his full siblings include Turki bin Salman, former chairman of the Saudi Research and Marketing Group, and Khalid bin Salman.[30] Prince Mohammad holds a bachelor's degree in law from King Saud University.[31]\\r\\nAfter graduating from college, Mohammad bin Salman spent several years in the private sector before becoming personal aide to his father. He worked as a consultant for the Experts Commission, working for the Saudi Cabinet.[32]\\r\\nOn 15 December 2009, at the age of 24, Mohammad bin Salman entered politics as a special advisor to his father when the latter was the governor of Riyadh Province.[33] At this time, Mohammad bin Salman began to rise from one position to another such as secretary-general of the Riyadh Competitive Council, special advisor to the chairman of the board for the King Abdulaziz Foundation for Research and Archives, and a member of the board of trustees for Albir Society in the Riyadh region.[34]\\r\\nIn October 2011, Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz died, and the current King Salman began his ascent to power by becoming second deputy prime minister and defense minister in November 2011 and making Mohammad bin Salman his private advisor.[35]\\r\\nIn June 2012, Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud died and Prince Muhammad bin Salman moved up into the number two position in the hierarchy, as his father became the new crown prince and first deputy prime minister. He soon began remaking the court in his own image. On 2 March 2013, the chief of the Crown Prince court Prince Saud bin Nayef was appointed governor of the Eastern Province and Prince Mohammad bin Salman succeeded him in the post. He was also given the rank of minister.[36][37][38] On 25 April 2014 Prince Mohammad was appointed state minister.[34]\\r\\nOn 23 January 2015, King Abdullah died, Salman took the throne and Prince Mohammad bin Salman was appointed Minister of Defense.[39] He was also named as the Secretary General of the Royal Court on the same date.[40] In addition he retained his post as the Minister of the State.[41][42]\\r\\nIn Yemen, the political unrest (which began escalating in 2011) rapidly became a major issue for the newly appointed Minister of Defense, with rebel Houthis taking control of northern Yemen in late 2014, followed by President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and his cabinets resignation. Mohammad bin Salmans first move as minister was to mobilize a pan-GCC coalition to intervene following a series of suicide bombings in Sanaa via air strikes against Houthis, and impose a naval blockade.[43] In March 2015, Saudi Arabia began leading a coalition of countries allied against the Houthi rebels.[44] According to The New York Times, \\"Although all agreed that the Kingdom had to respond when the Houthis seized the Yemeni capital and forced the government into exile, Prince Mohammad bin Salman took the lead, launching the war in March 2015 without full coordination across the security services.\\" Prince Mohammed bin Salman maintained restrictive coordination across security services and drove operations from the Maldives. Saudi National Guard Minister Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, who was out of the country, was not in the loop of the operations, and US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter officially declared having trouble reaching him for days after the first strikes.\\"[13] While Prince Mohammad bin Salman sold the war as a quick win on Houthi rebels in Yemen and a way to put President Hadi back in power, however, it became a long war of attrition.[45][46]\\r\\nIn April 2015, Muhammad bin Nayef, who is King Salman's nephew,[47][48] and Prince Mohammad bin Salman became Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince, respectively, under King Salmans royal decrees.[49]\\r\\nRegarding his role in the military intervention, Prince Mohammad bin Salman gave his first on-the-record interview on 4 January 2016 to The Economist, which had called him the architect of the war in Yemen. Denying the title, he explained the mechanism of the decision-making institutions actually holding stakes in the intervention, including the council of security and political affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Saudi side. He added that the Houthis usurped power in the Yemeni capital Sanaa before he served as Minister of Defense.[50][51][45]\\r\\nMohammad bin Salman was appointed Crown Prince on 21 June 2017, following his father's decision to depose Muhammad bin Nayef, making him heir apparent to the throne.[52][53] The change of succession had been predicted in December 2015 by an unusually blunt and public memo published by the German Federal Intelligence Service,[54][55] which was subsequently rebuked by the German government.[56]\\r\\nOn the day he became Crown Prince, U.S. President Donald Trump called Mohammad bin Salman to \\"congratulate him on his recent elevation\\". Trump and the new crown prince pledged \\"close cooperation\\" on security and economic issues, according to the White House, and the two leaders also discussed the need to cut off support for terrorism, the recent diplomatic dispute with Qatar, and the push to secure peace between Israel and the Palestinians.[57] Mohammad bin Salman told the Washington Post in April 2017 that without America's cultural influence on Saudi Arabia, \\"we would have ended up like North Korea.\\"[58]\\r\\nOn 29 January 2015, Prince Mohammad was named the chair of the newly established Council for Economic and Development Affairs,[59] replacing the disbanded Supreme Economic Commission.[59] In April 2015, Prince Mohammad bin Salman was given control over Saudi Aramco by royal decree following his appointment as deputy crown prince.[60]\\r\\nPrince Mohammad bin Salman took the leadership in the restructuring of Saudi Arabia's economy, which he officially announced in April 2016 when he introduced Vision 2030, the country's strategic orientation for the next 15 years. Vision 2030 plans to reform Saudi's economy towards a more diversified and privatized structure. It details goals and measures in various fields, from developing non-oil revenues and privatization of the economy to e-government and sustainable development.[61]\\r\\nAt the inaugural Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh in October 2017, bin Salman announced plans for the creation of Neom, a $500 billion economic zone to cover an area of 26,000 square kilometres on Saudi Arabias Red Sea coast, extending into Jordan and Egypt.[62] Neom aims to attract investment in sectors including renewable energy, biotechnology, robotics and advanced manufacturing.[63][64] The announcement followed plans to develop a 34,000 square kilometre area across a lagoon of 50 islands on Saudi Arabias Red Sea coastline into a luxury tourism destination with laws on a par with international standards.[65][66] In a further effort to boost the tourism industry, in November 2017 it was announced that Saudi Arabia would start issuing tourist visas for foreigners, beginning in 2018.[67]\\r\\nPrince Mohammad bin Salman's biggest bet was his plan to restore the Saudi kingdom's dominance in global oil markets by driving the new competition into bankruptcy, by keeping the oil price low enough for a long enough period. Saudi Arabia persuaded OPEC to do the same. A few small players went bankrupt, but American frackers only shut down their less-profitable operations temporarily, and waited for oil prices to go up again. Saudi Arabia, which had been spending $100 billion a year to keep services and subsidies going, had to admit defeat in November 2016. It then cut production significantly and asked its OPEC partners to do the same.[45]\\r\\nPrince bin Salman has successfully lobbied for regulations restricting the powers of the religious police.[13] Prince bin Salman established an entertainment authority that has hosted comedy shows, pro wrestling events, and monster truck rallies.[13] In an interview with al Arabiya he also shared his idea for \\"Green cards\\" for non-Saudi foreigners.[68]\\r\\nIn February 2017, Saudi Arabia appointed its first woman to head the Saudi Stock Exchange.[69][70]\\r\\nIn April 2017, bin Salman announced a project to build one of the worlds largest cultural, sports and entertainment cities in Al Qidiya, southwest of Riyadh. The 334 square kilometre city will include a safari and a Six Flags theme park.[71][72]\\r\\nAs of February 2018, Saudi women can now open their own business, without a male's permission.[73]\\r\\nAccording to the Saudi Information Ministry, mothers in Saudi Arabia can now retain immediate custody of their children after divorce without having to file any lawsuits.[74]\\r\\nFurther cultural developments followed in December that year with the Saudi Arabias first public concert by a female singer, and in January 2018 a sports stadium in Jeddah became the first in the Kingdom to admit women.[15][75] In the same month it was announced that Saudi Arabia would reopen public cinemas after a ban of 35 years, with plans to have more than 2,000 screens running by 2030.[76]\\r\\nThe first measures undertaken in April 2016 included new taxes and cuts in subsidies, a diversification plan, the creation of a $2 trillion Saudi sovereign wealth fund, and a series of strategic economic reforms called the National Transformation Programme.[77] Prince bin Salman plans to raise capital for the sovereign wealth fund by selling off shares of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned petroleum?and?natural gas?company,[60] with the capital to be re-invested in other sectors such as to implement the diversification plans.[78] However, as of October 2017, the plan for Aramcos IPO listing has been labeled \\"a mess\\" by The Economist.[79]\\r\\nPrince Mohammad bin Salman slashed the state budget, freezing government contracts and reducing the pay of civil employees as part of drastic austerity measures.[80][45]\\r\\nPrince Mohammad is seen as the figure behind the removal of the ban on female drivers in September 2017.[14] He has also chipped away at Saudi Arabias Wali system.[81]\\r\\nIn October 2017, he said the ultra-conservative Saudi state had been \\"not normal\\" for the past 30 years, blaming rigid doctrines that have governed society in a reaction to the Iranian Revolution, which successive leaders \\"didnt know how to deal with\\".[82] According to him, Saudi Arabia is \\"returning to what we were beforea country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world\\".[83] In essence, he was telling the country's clerics that the deal the royal family struck with them after the 1979 siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca is being renegotiated.[84] Building an industrial culture was not compatible with Wahhabism. The Wahhabis were committed to fixed social and gender relationships. These were consistent with an economy built on oil sales, but industrialization requires a dynamic culture with social relations constantly shifting.[85]\\r\\nAccording to Politico, MbS wants to pre-empt a repetition of the downfall of the earlier Saudi states due to familial infighting, internal malaise, external frailty and failure to modernize. Mindful of this history, instead of waiting for todays Saudi state to weaken and fall, MBS is trying to save the country before it collapses.[86]\\r\\nAyaan Hirsi Ali claims that \\"if M.B.S. succeeds in his modernization efforts, Saudis will benefit from new opportunities and freedoms, and the world will benefit from curtailing the Wahhabi radicalization agenda. A decade from now, the kingdom could look more like the United Arab Emirates, its prosperous and relatively forward-looking neighbor.\\"[87]\\r\\nIn May 2017, Mohammad bin Salman publicly warned \\"I confirm to you, no one will survive in a corruption casewhoever he is, even if hes a prince or a minister\\".[88] On 4 November 2017, the Saudi press announced the arrest of the Saudi prince and billionaire Al-Waleed bin Talal, a frequent English-language news commentator and a major shareholder in Citi, News Corp and Twitter, as well as over 40 princes and government ministers at the behest of the Crown Prince on corruption and money laundering charges.[89]\\r\\nOthers arrested or fired in the purge included Mutaib bin Abdullah, head of the Saudi Arabian National Guard, Adel Fakeih, the Minister of Economy and Planning, and the Commander of the Saudi Naval Forces, Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan.[89][90]\\r\\nSome analysts saw the arrests as part of a power grab on the part of Salman. The New York Times wrote:\\r\\nWriting for the Huffington Post, University of Delaware professor of Islam and Global Affairs, Muqtedar Khan, speculated as to whether the removal of Talal, a critic of Donald Trump, amounted to a coup.[91] BBC correspondent Frank Gardner was quoted as saying that \\"Prince Mohammed is moving to consolidate his growing power while spearheading a reform programme\\". Yet \\"[i]t is not clear what those detained are suspected of.\\"[92]\\r\\nOther analysts see the purge as part of a move towards reform. Steven Mufson of the Washington Post argues that Crown Prince Mohammed knows that only if he can place the royal family under the law, and not above as it was in the past, can he ask the whole country to change their attitudes relative to taxes [and] subsidies.[93] An analysis from the CBC claimed that \\"the clampdown against corruption resonates with ordinary Saudis who feel that the state has been asking them to accept belt tightening while, at the same time, they see corruption and the power elite accumulating more wealth\\".[94] Bin Salman's ambitious reform agenda is widely popular with Saudi Arabia's burgeoning youth population but faces resistance from some of the old guard more comfortable with the kingdom's traditions of incremental change and rule by consensus.[95] According to a former British ambassador to Riyadh, Bin Salman \\"is the first prince in modern Saudi history whose constituency has not been within the royal family, its outside it. Its been young Saudis, particularly younger Saudi men in the street\\".[96]\\r\\nRobert Jordan, former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said that \\"Certainly Saudi Arabia has had a corruption problem for many years. I think the population, especially, has been very unhappy with princes coming in and grabbing business deals, with public funds going to flood control projects that never seem to get built... I would also say it's a classical power grab move sometimes to arrest your rivals, your potential rivals under the pretext of corruption\\".[97]\\r\\nA Eurasia Group director states that \\"Mohammed bin Salman is in effect taking steps to separate the Al Saud family from the state...The process of destroying old elite networks that monopolized access to profitable contracts bodes well for the business environment.\\"[88][unreliable source?]\\r\\nUS President Trump expressed support for the move, tweeting \\"I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing....Some of those they are harshly treating have been milking their country for years!\\"[98][99] French President Macron, who visited Riyadh days after the purge, when asked about the purge stated \\"this is not the role of a president, and similarly I would not expect a leader of a foreign country to come and infringe on domestic matters,\\"[100]\\r\\nMohammad bin Salman established himself as the chairman of the Prince Mohammad bin Salman Foundation, otherwise known as MiSK, which puts in place activities empowering and enabling the younger generation, in line with Vision 2030s goals of a more developed nation.[101] The foundation was a partner of the 9th UNESCO Youth Forum for Change in 2015.[102] In 2017, the with Vision 2030 goals aligned new city, Neom was announced.[103]\\r\\nThe foundation focuses on the country's youth and provides different means of fostering talent, creative potential, and innovation in a healthy environment that offers opportunities in arts and sciences. The foundation pursues these goals by establishing programs and partnering with local and global organizations. It intends to develop intellectual capability in youth, as well as unlock the potential of all Saudi people.[104] Saudi journalists traveling with Prince Mohammed on foreign delegations have been paid up to $100,000 in cash.[13]\\r\\nIn late 2015, Prince Mohammad attended a meeting between King Salman and U.S. President Barack Obama, where the prince broke protocol to deliver a monologue criticizing U.S. foreign policy.[13] In addition, when Prince bin Salman announced an anti-terrorist military alliance of Islamic countries in December 2015, some of the countries involved said they had not been consulted.[13]\\r\\nOn 10 January 2016, The Independent reported that \\"the BND, the German intelligence agency, portrayed...Saudi defence minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman...as a political gambler who is destabilising the Arab world through proxy wars in Yemen and Syria.\\"[49][45][51][105] German officials reacted to the BNDs memo, saying the published statement \\"is not the position of the federal government\\".[56]\\r\\nDuring the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, thousands of civilians were reportedly killed in a major bombing campaign, prompting accusations of war crimes in the intervention.[106][107][108] So far, the war and blockade of Yemen has already cost the kingdom tens of billions of dollars, further aggravated the humanitarian crisis in the country and destroyed much of Yemen's infrastructure but failed to dislodge the Shiite Houthi rebels and their allies from the Yemeni capital.[109][80][49]On March 28, 2018 Saudi Arabia, along with its coalition partner the UAE, donated $930 million USD to the United Nations which, according to UN Secretary-General Antonio Gueterres, \\"(will) help to alleviate the suffering of millions of vulnerable people across Yemen.\\" The funds cover almost one-third of the $2.96 billion required to implement the UN's 2018 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan.[110]\\r\\nDespite promised reforms, the arrests and persecution of activists has risen under Mohammad bin Salman according to the Gulf Centre for Human Rights.[111] The crackdown on human right activists includes the academic and novelist Mustafa al-Hassan, Abdullah al-Malki, Essam al-Zamel, all arrested in 12 September 2017. Two founding members of ACPRA, Abdulaziz al-Shubaily and Issa al-Hamid, were arrested on 16 September 2017, one was charged with \\"communicating with international organisations in order to harm the image of the state\\"[112] and sentenced to 11 years in prison on appeal, and a nine years of travel ban after he served his sentence. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch continue to criticize the Saudi government for its violations of human rights.[24][25][26]\\r\\nIn April 2018, Mohammad met Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who \\"urged the Crown Prince to continue his efforts to advance womens rights, and raised concerns about human rights and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen.\\"[113]\\r\\nIn August 2016, Donald Trump Jr. had a meeting with an envoy representing Mohammad bin Salman and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi. The envoy offered help to the Trump presidential campaign.[114] The meeting included Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation, Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, and Blackwater founder Erik Prince.[115][114]\\r\\nIn 2015, Mohammad bin Salman purchased the Italian-built and Bermuda-registered yacht Serene from Russian vodka tycoon Yuri Shefler for ?500 million.[116][117] In December 2017, a number of sources reported that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, using his close associate Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud as an intermediary, had bought Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi; the sale in November at $450.3 million set a new record price for a work of art.[118][119][120][121] The Embassy of Saudi Arabia[122], the Government of the United Arab Emirates, which has announced that it is in fact the owner of the painting[123], and the auctioneer Christie's have denied this claim[123]. The painting is presently located at its permanent home in the Louvre Museum's extension in Abu Dhabi, UAE.[124][125]\\r\\nMohammads net worth is estimated at US$3.0 billion.[126] The New York Times has reported that Crown Prince Mohammad has purchased the $300 million Chateau Louis XIV in France.[127]\\r\\nMohammad has travelled extensively around the world, meeting with politicians, business leaders and celebrities.[117] In June 2016, he travelled to Silicon Valley and met key people in the US high tech industry, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.[128]\\r\\nIn early 2018, Prince Mohammad visited the United States where he met with many top politicians, business people and Hollywood stars, including President Trump, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Michael Bloomberg, George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Oprah Winfrey, Rupert Murdoch, Richard Branson, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Dwayne Johnson.[113][129] He also visited the United Kingdom where he met with Prime Minister Theresa May, Queen Elizabeth II and the Prince William.[130]\\r\\nMohammad bin Salman married Princess Sarah bint Mashhoor in 2008. They have four children.[131]","input":"Where was the crown prince of saudi arabia educated?"},{"output":"Mount Whitney","context":"Mount Whitney is not only the highest point in California but also the highest summit in the contiguous United States and the Sierra Nevada, with an elevation of 14,505 feet (4,421?m).[5]. It is on the boundary between California's Inyo and Tulare counties, 84.6 miles (136.2?km)[8] west-northwest of the lowest point in North America at Badwater Basin in Death Valley National Park at 282?ft (86?m) below sea level.[9] The west slope of the mountain is in Sequoia National Park and the summit is the southern terminus of the John Muir Trail which runs 211.9?mi (341.0?km) from Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley.[10] The east slope is in the Inyo National Forest in Inyo County.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summit of Mount Whitney is on the Sierra Crest and the Great Basin Divide. It lies near many of the highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada.[11] The peak rises dramatically above the Owens Valley, sitting 10,778 feet (3,285?m) or just over two miles above the town of Lone Pine 15 miles to the east, in the Owens Valley.[11][11] It rises more gradually on the west side, lying only about 3,000 feet (910?m) above the John Muir Trail at Guitar Lake.[12]\\r\\nThe mountain is partially dome-shaped, with its famously jagged ridges extending to the sides.[13] Mount Whitney is above the tree line and has an alpine climate and ecology.[14] Very few plants grow near the summit: one example is the Skypilot, a cushion plant that grows low to the ground.[15] The only animals are transient, such as the butterfly Parnassius phoebus and the gray-crowned rosy finch.[15]\\r\\nThe mountain is the highest point on the Great Basin Divide. Waterways on the west side of the peak flow into Whitney Creek, which flows into the Kern River. The Kern River terminates in the Tulare Basin. During very wet years, water overflows from the Tulare Basin into the San Joaquin River which flows to the Pacific Ocean. From the east, water from Mount Whitney flows to Lone Pine Creek, which joins the Owens River, which in turn terminates at Owens Lake, an endorheic lake of the Great Basin.\\r\\nThe estimated elevation of the summit of Mount Whitney has changed over the years. The technology of elevation measurement has become more refined and, more importantly, the vertical coordinate system has changed. The peak was commonly said to be at 14,494?ft (4,418?m) and this is the elevation stamped on the USGS brass benchmark disk on the summit. An older plaque on the summit (sheet metal with black lettering on white enamel) reads \\"elevation 14,496.811 feet\\" but this was estimated using the older vertical datum (NGVD29) from 1929. Since then the shape of the Earth (the geoid) has been estimated more accurately. Using a new vertical datum established in 1988 (NAVD88) the benchmark is now estimated to be at 14,505?ft (4,421?m).[5][16]\\r\\nThe eastern slope of Whitney is far steeper than its western slope because the entire Sierra Nevada is the result of a fault-block that is analogous to a cellar door: the door is hinged on the west and is slowly rising on the east.[17]\\r\\nThe rise is caused by a normal fault system that runs along the eastern base of the Sierra, below Mount Whitney. Thus, the granite that forms Mount Whitney is the same as the granite that forms the Alabama Hills, thousands of feet lower down.[15] The raising of Whitney (and the downdrop of the Owens Valley) is due to the same geological forces that cause the Basin and Range Province: the crust of much of the intermontane west is slowly being stretched.[18]\\r\\nThe granite that forms Mount Whitney is part of the Sierra Nevada batholith.[19] In Cretaceous time, masses of molten rock that originated from subduction rose underneath what is now Whitney and solidified underground to form large expanses of granite.[19] In the last 2 to 10 million years, the Sierra was pushed up which enabled glacial and river erosion to strip the upper layers of rock to reveal the resistant granite that makes up Mount Whitney today.[20]\\r\\nIn July 1864, the members of the California Geological Survey named the peak after Josiah Whitney, the State Geologist of California and benefactor of the survey.[7] During the same expedition, geologist Clarence King attempted to climb Whitney from its west side, but stopped just short. In 1871, King returned to climb what he believed to be Whitney, but having taken a different approach, he actually summited nearby Mount Langley. Upon learning of his mistake in 1873, King finally completed his own first ascent of Whitney, but did so a month too late to claim the first recorded ascent.[21] Just a month earlier, on August 18, 1873, Charles Begole, A. H. Johnson, and John Lucas, all of nearby Lone Pine, had become the first to reach the highest summit in the contiguous United States. As they climbed the mountain during a fishing trip to nearby Kern Canyon, they called the mountain Fisherman's Peak.[7]\\r\\nIn 1881 Samuel Pierpont Langley, founder of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory remained for some time on the summit, making daily observations on the solar heat.[22] Accompanying Langley in 1881 was another party consisting of Judge William B. Wallace of Visalia, W. A. Wright and Reverend Frederick Wales.[23] Wallace later wrote in his memoirs [24] that \\"The Pi Ute [Paiute] Indians called Mt. Whitney \\"Too-man-i-goo-yah,\\" which means \\"the very old man.\\" They believe that the Great Spirit who presides over the destiny of their people once had his home in that mountain.\\" The spelling Too-man-i-goo-yah is a transliteration from the indigenous Paiute Mono language. Other variations are Too-man-go-yah [25] and Tumanguya.[26]\\r\\nIn 1891, the United States Geological Survey's Board on Geographic Names decided to recognize the earlier name Mount Whitney. Despite losing out on their preferred name, residents of Lone Pine financed the first trail to the summit, engineered by Gustave Marsh, and completed on July 22, 1904. Just four days later, the new trail enabled the first recorded death on Whitney. Having hiked the trail, U.S. Bureau of Fisheries employee Byrd Surby was struck and killed by lightning while eating lunch on the exposed summit. In response to this event, Marsh began work on the stone hut that would become the Smithsonian Institution Shelter, and completed it in 1909.[27]\\r\\nA movement after World War II began to rename the mountain for Winston Churchill.[28] However, the name Mount Whitney has persisted.\\r\\nThe most popular route to the summit is by way of the Mount Whitney Trail which starts at Whitney Portal, at an elevation of 8,360?ft (2,550?m), 13?mi (21?km) west of the town of Lone Pine. The hike is about 22?mi (35?km) round trip with an elevation gain of over 6,100?ft (1,900?m). Permits are required year round, and to prevent overuse a limited number of permits are issued by the Forest Service between May 1 and November 1.[29] The Forest Service holds an annual lottery for hiking and backpacking permits on the Mount Whitney Trail. Applications are accepted from February 1 through March 15. Any permits left over after the lottery is completed typically go on sale April 1.[30] Most hikers do the trip in two days which is still considered a strenuous endeavor. Those in good physical condition sometimes attempt to reach the summit and return to Whitney Portal in one day, thus requiring only a somewhat easier-to-obtain \\"day use\\" permit rather than the overnight permit, and prohibiting the use of overnight camping gear (sleeping bag and tent). This is considered an \\"extreme\\" day hike, which normally involves leaving Whitney Portal before sunrise and 12 to 18 hours of strenuous hiking,[31] while struggling with altitude sickness, cold air, and occasionally treacherous surface conditions (because snow and/or ice are normally present on parts of the trail, except for a short period from early July to late September).\\r\\nLonger approaches to Whitney arrive at its west side, connecting to the Mount Whitney Trail near the summit by way of the John Muir Trail.\\r\\nThe \\"Mountaineer's Route\\", a gully on the north side of the east face first climbed by John Muir, is considered a scramble, class?3 (PD+).[32] The fastest recorded time up this route to the summit and back to the portal is 3 hours 10 minutes, by Jason Lakey of Bishop.[33]\\r\\nThe steep eastern side of the mountain offers a variety of climbing challenges. The East Face route, first climbed in 1931, is one of the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America routes and involves technical free climbing (class?5.7) but is mostly class 4. Other routes range up to grade 5.10d.[32]\\r\\nSouth of the main summit there are a series of minor summits that are completely inconspicuous from the west but appear as a series of \\"needles\\" from the east. The routes on these include some of the finest big-wall climbing in the high Sierra. Two of the needles were named after participants in an 1880 scientific expedition to the mountain. Keeler Needle was named for James Keeler and Day Needle was named for William Cathcart Day. The latter has now been renamed Crooks Peak after Hulda Crooks who hiked up Mount Whitney every year until well into her nineties.","input":"What is the highest mountain in the lower 48 united states?"},{"output":"Nepal","context":"","input":"Which country is the north of uttar pradesh?"},{"output":"J in SI units","context":"In thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy (IUPAC recommended name: Gibbs energy or Gibbs function; also known as free enthalpy[1] to distinguish it from Helmholtz free energy) is a thermodynamic potential that can be used to calculate the maximum of reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure (isothermal, isobaric). The Gibbs free energy (Go = Ho-TSo) (J in SI units) is the maximum amount of non-expansion work that can be extracted from a thermodynamically closed system (one that can exchange heat and work with its surroundings, but not matter); this maximum can be attained only in a completely reversible process. When a system transforms reversibly from an initial state to a final state, the decrease in Gibbs free energy equals the work done by the system to its surroundings, minus the work of the pressure forces.[2]\\r\\nThe Gibbs energy (also referred to as G) is also the thermodynamic potential that is minimized when a system reaches chemical equilibrium at constant pressure and temperature. Its derivative with respect to the reaction coordinate of the system vanishes at the equilibrium point. As such, a reduction in G is a necessary condition for the spontaneity of processes at constant pressure and temperature.\\r\\nThe Gibbs free energy, originally called available energy, was developed in the 1870s by the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs. In 1873, Gibbs described this \\"available energy\\" as\\r\\nthe greatest amount of mechanical work which can be obtained from a given quantity of a certain substance in a given initial state, without increasing its total volume or allowing heat to pass to or from external bodies, except such as at the close of the processes are left in their initial condition.[3]\\r\\nThe initial state of the body, according to Gibbs, is supposed to be such that \\"the body can be made to pass from it to states of dissipated energy by reversible processes\\". In his 1876 magnum opus On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances, a graphical analysis of multi-phase chemical systems, he engaged his thoughts on chemical free energy in full.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the second law of thermodynamics, for systems reacting at STP (or any other fixed temperature and pressure), there is a general natural tendency to achieve a minimum of the Gibbs free energy.\\r\\nA quantitative measure of the favorability of a given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the change G (sometimes written \\"delta G\\" or \\"dG\\") in Gibbs free energy that is (or would be) caused by the reaction. As a necessary condition for the reaction to occur at constant temperature and pressure, G must be smaller than the non-PV (e.g. electrical) work, which is often equal to zero (hence G must be negative). G equals the maximum amount of non-PV work that can be performed as a result of the chemical reaction for the case of reversible process. If the analysis indicated a positive G for the reaction, then energy  in the form of electrical or other non-PV work  would have to be added to the reacting system for G to be smaller than the non-PV work and make it possible for the reaction to occur.[4]:298ÿ299\\r\\nThe equation can be also seen from the perspective of the system taken together with its surroundings (the rest of the universe). First, assume that the given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the only one that is occurring. Then the entropy released or absorbed by the system equals the entropy that the environment must absorb or release, respectively. The reaction will only be allowed if the total entropy change of the universe is zero or positive. This is reflected in a negative G, and the reaction is called exergonic.\\r\\nIf we couple reactions, then an otherwise endergonic chemical reaction (one with positive G) can be made to happen. The input of heat into an inherently endergonic reaction, such as the elimination of cyclohexanol to cyclohexene, can be seen as coupling an unfavourable reaction (elimination) to a favourable one (burning of coal or other provision of heat) such that the total entropy change of the universe is greater than or equal to zero, making the total Gibbs free energy difference of the coupled reactions negative.\\r\\nIn traditional use, the term \\"free\\" was included in \\"Gibbs free energy\\" to mean \\"available in the form of useful work\\".[2] The characterization becomes more precise if we add the qualification that it is the energy available for non-volume work[clarification needed].[5] (An analogous, but slightly different, meaning of \\"free\\" applies in conjunction with the Helmholtz free energy, for systems at constant temperature). However, an increasing number of books and journal articles do not include the attachment \\"free\\", referring to G as simply \\"Gibbs energy\\". This is the result of a 1988 IUPAC meeting to set unified terminologies for the international scientific community, in which the adjective \\"free\\" was supposedly banished.[6][7][8] This standard, however, has not yet been universally adopted.\\r\\nThe quantity called \\"free energy\\" is a more advanced and accurate replacement for the outdated term affinity, which was used by chemists in the earlier years of physical chemistry to describe the force that caused chemical reactions.\\r\\nIn 1873, Willard Gibbs published A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces, in which he sketched the principles of his new equation that was able to predict or estimate the tendencies of various natural processes to ensue when bodies or systems are brought into contact. By studying the interactions of homogeneous substances in contact, i.e., bodies composed of part solid, part liquid, and part vapor, and by using a three-dimensional volume-entropy-internal energy graph, Gibbs was able to determine three states of equilibrium, i.e., \\"necessarily stable\\", \\"neutral\\", and \\"unstable\\", and whether or not changes would ensue. Further, Gibbs stated:[9]\\r\\nIf we wish to express in a single equation the necessary and sufficient condition of thermodynamic equilibrium for a substance when surrounded by a medium of constant pressure p and temperature T, this equation may be written:\\r\\nwhen Ѵ refers to the variation produced by any variations in the state of the parts of the body, and (when different parts of the body are in different states) in the proportion in which the body is divided between the different states. The condition of stable equilibrium is that the value of the expression in the parenthesis shall be a minimum.\\r\\nIn this description, as used by Gibbs,  refers to the internal energy of the body,  refers to the entropy of the body, and  is the volume of the body.\\r\\nThereafter, in 1882, the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz characterized the affinity as the largest quantity of work which can be gained when the reaction is carried out in a reversible manner, e.g., electrical work in a reversible cell. The maximum work is thus regarded as the diminution of the free, or available, energy of the system (Gibbs free energy G at T = constant, P = constant or Helmholtz free energy F at T = constant, V = constant), whilst the heat given out is usually a measure of the diminution of the total energy of the system (internal energy). Thus, G or F is the amount of energy \\"free\\" for work under the given conditions.\\r\\nUntil this point, the general view had been such that: \\"all chemical reactions drive the system to a state of equilibrium in which the affinities of the reactions vanish\\". Over the next 60 years, the term affinity came to be replaced with the term free energy. According to chemistry historian Henry Leicester, the influential 1923 textbook Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances by Gilbert N. Lewis and Merle Randall led to the replacement of the term \\"affinity\\" by the term \\"free energy\\" in much of the English-speaking world.[10]:206\\r\\nGibbs free energy was originally defined graphically. In 1873, American scientist Willard Gibbs published his first thermodynamics paper, \\"Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids\\", in which Gibbs used the two coordinates of the entropy and volume to represent the state of the body. In his second follow-up paper, \\"A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces\\", published later that year, Gibbs added in the third coordinate of the energy of the body, defined on three figures. In 1874, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell used Gibbs' figures to make a 3D energy-entropy-volume thermodynamic surface of a fictitious water-like substance.[11] Thus, in order to understand the very difficult concept of Gibbs free energy one must be able to understand its interpretation as Gibbs defined originally by section AB on his figure 3 and as Maxwell sculpted that section on his 3D surface figure.\\r\\nThe Gibbs free energy is defined as\\r\\nwhich is the same as\\r\\nwhere:\\r\\nThe expression for the infinitesimal reversible change in the Gibbs free energy as a function of its \\"natural variables\\" p and T, for an open system, subjected to the operation of external forces (for instance, electrical or magnetic) Xi, which cause the external parameters of the system ai to change by an amount dai, can be derived as follows from the first law for reversible processes:\\r\\nwhere:\\r\\nThis is one form of Gibbs fundamental equation.[13] In the infinitesimal expression, the term involving the chemical potential accounts for changes in Gibbs free energy resulting from an influx or outflux of particles. In other words, it holds for an open system or for a closed, chemically reacting system where the Ni are changing. For a closed, non-reacting system, this term may be dropped.\\r\\nAny number of extra terms may be added, depending on the particular system being considered. Aside from mechanical work, a system may, in addition, perform numerous other types of work. For example, in the infinitesimal expression, the contractile work energy associated with a thermodynamic system that is a contractile fiber that shortens by an amount ?dl under a force f would result in a term f dl being added. If a quantity of charge ?de is acquired by a system at an electrical potential , the electrical work associated with this is ? de, which would be included in the infinitesimal expression. Other work terms are added on per system requirements.[14]\\r\\nEach quantity in the equations above can be divided by the amount of substance, measured in moles, to form molar Gibbs free energy. The Gibbs free energy is one of the most important thermodynamic functions for the characterization of a system. It is a factor in determining outcomes such as the voltage of an electrochemical cell, and the equilibrium constant for a reversible reaction. In isothermal, isobaric systems, Gibbs free energy can be thought of as a \\"dynamic\\" quantity, in that it is a representative measure of the competing effects of the enthalpic[clarification needed] and entropic driving forces involved in a thermodynamic process.\\r\\nThe temperature dependence of the Gibbs energy for an ideal gas is given by the GibbsÿHelmholtz equation, and its pressure dependence is given by\\r\\nIf the volume is known rather than pressure, then it becomes\\r\\nor more conveniently as its chemical potential:\\r\\nIn non-ideal systems, fugacity comes into play.\\r\\nThe Gibbs free energy total differential natural variables may be derived by Legendre transforms of the internal energy.\\r\\nThe definition of G from above is\\r\\nTaking the total differential, we have\\r\\nReplacing dU with the result from the first law gives[15]\\r\\nThe natural variables of G are then p, T, and {Ni}.\\r\\nBecause S, V, and Ni are extensive variables, an Euler integral allows easy integration of dU:[15]\\r\\nBecause some of the natural variables of G are intensive, dG may not be integrated using Euler integrals as is the case with internal energy. However, simply substituting the above integrated result for U into the definition of G gives a standard expression for G:[15]\\r\\nThis result applies to homogeneous, macroscopic systems, but not to all thermodynamic systems.[16]\\r\\nThe system under consideration is held at constant temperature and pressure, and is closed (no matter can come in or out). The Gibbs energy of any system is \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\n=\\r\\nU\\r\\n+\\r\\nP\\r\\nV\\r\\n?\\r\\nT\\r\\nS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle G=U+PV-TS}\\r\\n\\r\\n and an infinitesimal change in G, at constant temperature and pressure yields:\\r\\nBy the first law of thermodynamics, a change in the internal energy U is given by\\r\\nwhere ѴQ is energy added as heat, and ѴW is energy added as work. The work done on the system may be written as ѴW = ?PdV + ѴWx, where ?PdV is the mechanical work of compression/expansion done on the system and ѴWx is all other forms of work, which may include electrical, magnetic, etc. Assuming that only mechanical work is done,\\r\\nand the infinitesimal change in G is:\\r\\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that for a closed system, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\nd\\r\\nS\\r\\n\\r\\nѴ\\r\\nQ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle TdS\\\\geq \\\\delta Q}\\r\\n\\r\\n, and so it follows that:\\r\\nThis means that for a system which is not in equilibrium, its Gibbs energy will always be decreasing, and when it is in equilibrium (i.e. no longer changing), the infinitesimal change dG will be zero. In particular, this will be true if the system is experiencing any number of internal chemical reactions on its path to equilibrium.\\r\\nDuring a reversible electrochemical reaction at constant temperature and pressure, the following equations involving the Gibbs free energy hold:\\r\\nand rearranging gives\\r\\nwhich relates the cell potential resulting from the reaction to the equilibrium constant and reaction quotient for that reaction (Nernst equation),\\r\\nwhere\\r\\nMoreover, we also have:\\r\\nwhich relates the equilibrium constant with Gibbs free energy. This implies that at equilibrium\\r\\nA chemical reaction will (or can) proceed spontaneously if the change in the total entropy of the universe that would be caused by the reaction is nonnegative. As discussed in the overview, if the temperature and pressure are held constant, the Gibbs free energy is a (negative) proxy for the change in total entropy of the universe. It is \\"negative\\" because S appears with a negative coefficient in the expression for G, so the Gibbs free energy moves in the opposite direction from the total entropy. Thus, a reaction with a positive Gibbs free energy will not proceed spontaneously. However, in biological systems (among others), energy inputs from other energy sources (including the Sun and exothermic chemical reactions) are \\"coupled\\" with reactions that are not entropically favored (i.e. have a Gibbs free energy above zero). Taking into account the coupled reactions, the total entropy in the universe increases. This coupling allows endergonic reactions, such as photosynthesis and DNA synthesis, to proceed without decreasing the total entropy of the universe. Thus biological systems do not violate the second law of thermodynamics.\\r\\nThe standard Gibbs free energy of formation of a compound is the change of Gibbs free energy that accompanies the formation of 1 mole of that substance from its component elements, at their standard states (the most stable form of the element at 25 degrees Celsius and 100 kilopascals). Its symbol is fG?.\\r\\nAll elements in their standard states (diatomic oxygen gas, graphite, etc.) have standard Gibbs free energy change of formation equal to zero, as there is no change involved.\\r\\nQf is the reaction quotient.

Most Shi'as (between 68% and 80%) live in mainly four countries: Iran, Azerbaijan, Bahrain and Iraq.[17] Today, many of the Shia sects are extinct. The major surviving Imamah-Muslim Sects are Usulism (with nearly more than 10%), Nizari Ismailism (with nearly more than 1%) and Alevism (with slightly more than 0.5%[18] but less than 1%[19]). The other existing groups include Zaydi Shi'a of Yemen whose population is nearly more than 0.5% of the world's Muslim population, Mustali Ismaili (with nearly 0.1%[20] whose Taiyabi adherents reside in Sindh and Gujarat in South Asia.

Jennings holds the record for the longest winning streak on the U.S. syndicated game show Jeopardy! and as being the second highest-earning contestant in game show history. In 2004, Jennings won 74 Jeopardy! games (in a row) before he was defeated by challenger Nancy Zerg on his 75th appearance. His total earnings on Jeopardy! are $3,196,300, consisting of $2,520,700 over his 74 wins, a $2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance, a $500,000 second-place prize in the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions, a $100,000 win for second-place prize in the Jeopardy Battle of the Decades, as well as half of a $300,000 prize in the IBM Challenge, when he competed against Watson.\\r\\nDuring his first run of Jeopardy! appearances, Jennings earned the record for the highest American game show winnings. His total was surpassed by Brad Rutter, who defeated Jennings in the finals of the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions (first aired on May 25, 2005), adding $2,000,000 to Rutter's existing Jeopardy! winnings. Jennings regained the record after appearing on several other game shows, culminating in an appearance on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? (first aired on October 10, 2008), though Rutter retained the record for highest Jeopardy! winnings and once again passed Jennings' total after his victory in the 2014 Jeopardy Battle of the Decades tournament.\\r\\nAfter his success on Jeopardy!, Jennings wrote about his experience and explored American trivia history and culture in his book Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs, published in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Edmonds, Washington, Jennings grew up in Seoul, South Korea (1981ÿ1992) and Singapore (1992ÿ1996), where his father worked for an international law firm and then as Asia Pacific Division Counsel of Oracle Corporation.[1] He watched Jeopardy! on American Forces Network television while growing up.[2]\\r\\nJennings went to Seoul Foreign School where he completed an International Baccalaureate diploma and then graduated with a degree in Computer Science and English at Brigham Young University, where he played on the school's quizbowl team for three and a half years. Jennings attended the University of Washington during his freshman year.[3]\\r\\nBefore 2003, Jeopardy! contestants were limited to five consecutive games. At the beginning of the show's twentieth season (in 2003), the rules were changed to allow contestants to remain on the show as long as they continued to win.[4] After this rule change, and until Jennings' run, the record winning streak was set by Tom Walsh, who won $186,900 in eight games in January 2004.\\r\\nBefore his Jeopardy! appearance, Jennings was a member of BYU's Quiz Bowl Team.[5] Jennings' run began during Jeopardy!'s 20th season with the episode aired on June 2, 2004, in which he unseated 2-time returning champion Jerry Harvey, and continued into season 21. In that first episode, Jennings's entire winning streak nearly ended before it even began. The Final Jeopardy answer was, \\"She's the first female track & field athlete to win medals in 5 different events at a single Olympics.\\" Jennings responded with \\"Who is Jones?\\", referring to Marion Jones (the shows were recorded before she was stripped of her medals as a result of admitted doping). Host Alex Trebek said, \\"We will accept that, in terms of female athletes, there aren't that many.\\" If the response had not been accepted, Jennings would have finished in 3rd place, and challenger Julia Lazarus would have won the game instead. Jennings' run was interrupted by the off-season break in July until September, 2004 Kids' Week, the Tournament of Champions (aired from September 20, 2004 through October 1, 2004), the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election (aired on Tuesday November 2, 2004, pushing his weeks of episodes to air from Wednesday to Saturday) and the College Championship (aired from November 10, 2004 through November 23, 2004). He did not participate in the Tournament of Champions, as invitations are only extended to champions who have already been defeated (with the exception of the winner(s) of the College Championship), which Jennings had not yet been.\\r\\nOn November 30, 2004, Jennings' reign as Jeopardy! champion ended when he lost his seventy-fifth game to challenger Nancy Zerg.[6] Jennings responded incorrectly to both Double Jeopardy! Daily Doubles, causing him to lose a combined $10,200 ($5,400 and $4,800, respectively) and leaving him with $14,400 at the end of the round. As a result, for only the tenth time in 75 games, Jennings did not have an insurmountable lead going into the Final Jeopardy! round.[7] Only Jennings and Zerg, who ended Double Jeopardy! with $10,000, were able to play Final Jeopardy! as third-place contestant David Hankins failed to finish with a positive score after Double Jeopardy!.\\r\\nThe Final Jeopardy! category was Business & Industry, and the clue was \\"Most of this firm's 70,000 seasonal white-collar employees work only four months a year\\". Jennings appeared perplexed during the time allowed to write a response, while Zerg finished her response quickly. Zerg responded correctly with \\"What is H&R Block?\\" and wagered $4,401 of her $10,000, giving her a $1 lead over Jennings with his response still to be revealed. Jennings incorrectly responded with \\"What is FedEx?\\", and lost the game with a final score of $8,799 after his $5,601 wager was deducted from his score. After his response was revealed to be incorrect, the audience audibly gasped. He was awarded $2,000 for his second-place finish, which gave him a final total of $2,522,700 for his run on Jeopardy!. Zerg, whom Jennings called a \\"formidable opponent\\", finished in third place on the next show. The audience gave a standing ovation in honor of both contestants, and Trebek called Zerg a \\"giant killer\\" as Jennings embraced her.\\r\\nJennings' 75 matches took place over a span of 182 calendar days.\\r\\nJeopardy! implemented some backstage changes during Jennings' run. Normally, players only get a short time to practice, but more rehearsal time was added so that the new players could get comfortable with the buzzers. Additionally, the person who managed the buzzer system was changed.[8] In his book Brainiac, Jennings says that the consistency of the original manager's timing had given an increasing advantage to continuing players, and that the change made a noticeable difference in the second season that he was on the show. At one point, announcer Johnny Gilbert stopped announcing Jennings' total wins during the show's opening.\\r\\nOn December 1, 2004, the day after his defeat, Jeopardy! broke with tradition by having Jennings make a guest appearance at the start of the broadcast, during which host Alex Trebek acknowledged his success and enumerated the various game show records he had broken.\\r\\nJennings appeared in The Guinness Book of World Records under \\"Most cash won on a game show.\\"\\r\\nAccording to the Nielsen TV National People Meter, Jeopardy!'s ratings were 22% higher during Jennings' run than they were during the same period the previous year. For several weeks of the winnings streak, Jeopardy! was ranked as TV's highest-rated syndicated program.[9] By the end of Jeopardy!'s 20th season several weeks later, the show had surpassed Wheel of Fortune in the ratings but Wheel, which is usually paired with Jeopardy! in programming, also benefited from Jennings' streak.[10]\\r\\nJennings has received a good deal of American media coverage. After his 38th win on Jeopardy!, during the summer break between tapings, Jennings made a guest appearance on Live with Regis and Kelly. There Jennings revealed that he had failed to qualify for Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, once hosted by Regis Philbin. During that guest appearance, Jennings said, \\"Jeopardy! is a man's game... it's not like Millionaire.\\"[11]\\r\\nJennings appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to present Letterman's \\"Top Ten List\\" (Top ten ways to irritate Alex Trebek). He appeared again on the program on the night his final show was televised, in addition to interview segments airing that night on local late evening news programming and on Nightline. Barbara Walters selected Jennings as one of the \\"Ten Most Fascinating People of 2004\\" for her twelfth annual ABC News special, which aired on December 8, 2004. While on his media tour following his final game, Jennings taped a segment for Sesame Street. TV Guide featured a segment of \\"The Top Ten TV Moments of 2004\\", in which Ken Jennings' loss placed third. On December 1, 2004, A&E aired an episode of Biography on Jennings and other Jeopardy! notables, including Frank Spangenberg and Eddie Timanus.\\r\\nOn December 28, 2004, Sony announced a 15-week, 75-show Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions. It featured Tournament of Champions, College Championship, and Teen Tournament winners from the show's 21-year run, as well as over 100 five-time champions. Jeopardy!'s executive producer, Harry Friedman, explained:\\r\\nThe 2003 rule change, which allows Jeopardy! players to keep playing until they're defeated, raised the question about how other five-time champions might have played under this rule. This tournament is an opportunity to give those past champions another chance to shine.\\r\\nThe field totaled 145 players including Jennings, who, unlike the other competitors, was automatically placed in the finals. The Ultimate Tournament of Champions offered substantial cash prizes; with a grand prize of $2,000,000 to the winner, $500,000 for the first runner-up, and $250,000 for the second runner-up. Guaranteed prize money was offered to all contestants.\\r\\nIn the final round of the Ultimate Tournament, Brad Rutter decisively defeated Jennings and Jerome Vered, with respective final scores of $62,000, $34,599, and $20,600. Jennings won the $500,000 prize for second place, but as a result of the Ultimate Tournament, Rutter temporarily displaced him as the highest overall winner of money on a game show. Jennings has said he is still happy with his second-place finish.\\r\\nFrom February 14ÿ16, 2011, Jeopardy's \\"IBM Challenge\\" featured the computer company's Watson against Jennings and Rutter in two matches played over three days.[12] The winner of the competition was Watson, winning $1 million for two charities, while Jennings was second and Rutter was third, receiving $300,000 and $200,000, respectively. Jennings and Rutter each pledged to donate half of their winnings to charity.\\r\\nThis was the first ever man-versus-machine competition in the show's history. At the end of the first episode, in which only the first match's Jeopardy! Round was aired, Rutter was tied with Watson at $5,000, while Jennings was in third with $2,000. After the second episode in which the first game was completed, Jennings remained at third with $4,800 while Rutter at second had $10,400.[13] The competition ended with Watson with $77,147, Jennings with $24,000, and Rutter with $21,600.[14] Below his response during the Final Jeopardy! Round, Jennings wrote on his screen \\"I for one welcome our new computer overlords.\\" It was the first time Rutter had been defeated against any human player, although the defeat is not on Rutter's Jeopardy! official record, as the competition was deemed an exhibition.\\r\\nJennings wrote about playing against Watson for Slate.[15]\\r\\nIn 2014, Jeopardy! aired a special 5-week Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades tournament. Jennings made it to the finals along with Brad Rutter and Roger Craig. Jennings placed second, winning a $100,000 prize, and Rutter won first place, securing a $1,000,000 prize.\\r\\nTaking advantage of the notoriety that Jennings's losing Final Jeopardy! answer afforded, H&R Block offered Jennings free tax planning and financial services for the rest of his life.[16] H&R Block senior vice president David Byers estimated that Jennings owed approximately $1.04 million in taxes on his winnings.[17][18]\\r\\nIn a 2011 Reddit IAmA, Jennings recalled how in 2004 the Democratic politicians Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid unsuccessfully asked Jennings to run for the United States Senate from Utah. Jennings commented, \\"That was when I realized the Democratic Party was f@#$ed in '04.\\"[19]\\r\\nJennings has written several books. Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs details his experiences on Jeopardy! and his research into trivia culture conducted after the completion of his run.[2] Ken Jennings's Trivia Almanac: 8,888 Questions in 365 Days, a hardcover book, is a compilation of trivia questionswith 3 categories and about 20 questions per day of the year.[20] Maphead: Charting the Wide, Weird World of Geography Wonks explores the world of map and geography enthusiasts.[21] Because I said so! is a humorous examination of 'The myths, tales & warnings every generation passes down to its kids'.[22] He also has written five books for his children's series, Junior Genius Guides. [23]\\r\\nJennings also had a column in Mental Floss magazine called \\"Six Degrees of Ken Jennings\\", in which readers submit two wildly different things and he has to connect them in exactly six moves, much in the same vein as the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game.[24] The column ran from November 2005;[25] to the SeptemberÿOctober 2010 issue.[26]\\r\\nAccording to Variety.com, Jennings and television producer Michael Davies teamed up as executive producers on a new game show format for Comedy Central. According to Comedy Central execs, it was planned that Jennings would co-host and participate.[27] The series was planned to premiere late in 2005 or in the first quarter of 2006; as of April 2006, development had stalled, and the show's future remained uncertain. Jennings explained on his website that \\"Stephen Colbert's show was doing so well in its post-Daily Show spot that Comedy Central decided they weren't in the market for a quiz show anymore.\\" However, as of mid-2006, he was still shopping a potential game show titled, Ken Jennings vs. the Rest of the World.[28]\\r\\nJennings appeared on The Colbert Report on September 13, 2006. During the interview, Colbert discussed Jennings's book, Brainiac, and mocked him not knowing the number of pages the book contained. After Colbert coined a word to describe intellectual nerdiness, \\"poindexterity\\", Jennings was going back and forth of what is the correct noun for \\"poindexter.\\" Jennings noted, as he had done earlier that day on NPR's Talk of the Nation, that since his streak, people \\"seem to have an extra-hard trivia question\\" in case they run into him.[29]\\r\\nHe also appeared twice on NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! program. In his Feb. 25, 2006 appearance on the \\"Not My Job\\" segment, he answered all three questions correctly, winning for a listener Carl Kasell's voice on that person's home answering machine. Jennings stated, \\"This is the proudest moment of my game show life.\\"[30] On June 1, 2013, Jennings made his debut as a panelist on Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.\\r\\nEntertainment Weekly put his performance on its end-of-the-decade \\"best of\\" list, saying, \\"Answer: A software engineer from Utah, he dominated the quizfest for a record 74 shows in 2004, amassing $2,520,700. Question: Who is Ken Jennings?\\"[31]\\r\\nJennings made the news in July 2006 when an article in the New York Post by Michael Starr criticized Jennings for what Starr perceived as lack of loyalty and gratitude on Jennings' part, citing an open letter to the producers of Jeopardy! and host Alex Trebek that Jennings wrote on his blog.[32][33] Jennings responded on his blog by explaining that the blog entry was satirical in tone, saying, \\"[Starr] knows there's no way I was genuinely calling for angry bees and ventriloquist's dummies to be added to the Jeopardy! format. It's a humor piece, and one which gets its laughs from the outrageous non sequiturs it proposes, not the ripeness of its target for criticism.\\"[34] Jennings had already posted a more serious comment defending Trebek that remains on his website.[35]\\r\\nJennings appeared on the first two episodes of the NBC game show 1 vs. 100 on October 13 and 20, 2006 as a mob member. He incorrectly answered the question, \\"what color is the number 1 space on a standard roulette wheel?\\" as \\"black\\" instead of \\"red\\" in his second episode, eliminating him from the game. (He explained that he did not know the answer because his Mormon faith prohibits gambling.)[36] He left the show with $714.29, his share of a $35,000 prize shared among 49 Mob members. Jennings returned to the show for a special \\"Last Man Standing\\" episode aired on February 9, 2007. He was eliminated on the final question, which asked which of the three options had been married the most times; he answered King Henry VIII, while the correct answer was Larry King. This episode was the first time Jennings had a chance at a rematch against rival Brad Rutter, who was also part of the mob and was eliminated before Jennings.\\r\\nIn 2007, Jennings was invited to be a contestant on the game show Grand Slam hosted by Dennis Miller and Amanda Byram, also a Sony Pictures production. The show debuted on Game Show Network (GSN) on August 4, 2007, and featured sixteen former game-show winners in a single-elimination tournament. Jennings, seeded second behind Brad Rutter, won the tournament and became the 2007 Grand Slam Champion after defeating Ogi Ogas (a second-round winner against Rutter) in the finals. He earned $100,000 for his victory.\\r\\nJennings was a contestant on an episode of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? that aired on October 10, 2008, which held the possibility of exceeding Rutter's total game show winnings. After winning $500,000, enough to surpass Rutter's total, Jennings chose not to attempt the final $1,000,000 question, which would have deducted $475,000 from his winnings if he missed it. As is customary on the show, Jennings was then shown the question to see what would have happened, and he provided the correct answer. Had he risked his winnings and correctly answered the question, he would have become the show's second $1,000,000 winner.\\r\\nFrom 2008 to 2009, Jennings appeared on GSN on Fridays for the trivia game Stump the Master. Home viewers send questions via the GSN website. Four callers are put on hold and Jennings selects from one of the categories. The caller for the category he picked comes on the line and reads the question. If Jennings does not answer or is incorrect, the caller wins $1,000 or more. Any time Jennings is right, the jackpot is increased by $1,000. All callers are given a small prize, whether they participate on the air or not.\\r\\nJennings has appeared on multiple episodes of Doug Loves Movies, hosted by Doug Benson, and has won a few times.\\r\\nJennings also appeared on two other Sony Pictures Television game shows, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, as a frequent expert for the lifeline \\"Ask the Expert\\", and also taped a pilot for the proposed 2009 CBS revival of Sony's The $25,000 Pyramid.[37]\\r\\nJennings appeared on Millionaire in 2014 as a contestant during Guinness World Records Edition themed week, where he won $100,000 after deciding to walk away on his $250,000 question. If he had gone for it, he would have been right and would have won $250,000.[38]\\r\\nJennings appeared on the second-season premiere of 500 Questions on May 26, 2016[39] and was eliminated on the fourth question, leaving with no winnings.\\r\\nJennings appeared on an episode of @midnight aired May 15th, 2017 during the fourth season, which he won. As a result, he served as the funniest person on the internet for May 16th, 2017.[40]\\r\\nJennings won the rookie division of the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament (ACPT) in 2006.[41] In his first time competing, Jennings placed 37th overall. He also served as the award's presenter, becoming the first contestant to present an award to himself. He has not competed in the tournament since.\\r\\nJennings had a weekly trivia column Kennections in Parade magazine.[42] In it, five questions are posed and their answers are all connected to a mystery topic, which the readers are to guess. Parade ceased publishing the quiz in early 2015, and removed links to archived quizzes in March 2015. Kennections now appear in the online version of Mental Floss magazine.\\r\\nEvery Tuesday, Jennings sends an email out containing seven questions, one of which is designed to be Google-resistant.[43] Subscribers respond with the answers to all 7 questions and the results are maintained on a scoreboard on Jennings' blog.[44] At times he chooses to run multi-week tournaments, awarding the top responder with all 7 answers correct with such things as a signed copy of his newest book.\\r\\nPaste named his Twitter one of \\"The 75 Best Twitter Accounts of 2014\\" ranking it at #10.[45]\\r\\nJennings was the subject of some controversy for posting a tweet when he wrote \\"Nothing sadder than a hot person in a wheelchair.\\"[46][47][48][49]\\r\\nJennings again faced controversy when on November 10, 2015 he tweeted a joke about the death of Daniel Fleetwood, a lifelong Star Wars fan who died of cancer. Fleetwood's dying wish was to see Star Wars: The Force Awakens fearing he likely would not live to see the film when it opened in theaters in December 2015. An online campaign was started on his behalf and his wish was granted only days before he died. Jennings said It cant be a good sign that every fan who has seen the new Star Wars movie died shortly thereafter.[50]\\r\\nJennings once more faced controversy when on May 31, 2017 he tweeted a joke involving Barron Trump, the youngest child of U.S. President Donald Trump. According to TMZ, after 11-year-old Barron Trump saw an image of Kathy Griffin holding a bloody Trump mask, he believed it was real and screamed. Jennings wrote, \\"Barron Trump saw a very long necktie on a heap of expired deli meat in a dumpster. He thought it was his dad & his little heart is breaking.\\"[51] After the tweet garnered controversy, Jennings said, \\"The joke doesn't mock Barron. It mocks using him for political cover.\\"[52]\\r\\nOn September 7, 2017 HowStuffWorks unveiled a new show entitled Omnibus, co-hosted by Jennings and John Roderick , frontman of the indie-rock band The Long Winters. They will pick topics they fear might be lost to history and discuss them.[53]\\r\\nJennings agreed to a deal with Microsoft to promote its Encarta encyclopedia software (which was later discontinued). He is also engaged in speaking deals through the Massachusetts-based speakers agency American Program Bureau.[54] In 2005, Cingular Wireless (now AT&T) featured Jennings in commercials portraying him as having lots of \\"friends and family\\" (coming out of the woodwork, because he is now \\"stinking rich\\").\\r\\nUniversity Games produced a Can You Beat Ken? board game, in which players vie against each other and Jennings in an attempt to earn $2.6 million first. Each question in the game was asked to Jennings, and his answers, both correct and incorrect, are recorded on the cards.[55]\\r\\nHe and his wife Mindy (ne Boam)[3] have a son, Dylan, born in 2002, and a daughter, Caitlin, born in 2006.[56]\\r\\nJennings currently resides in the Seattle metropolitan area.

He also writes questions for, edits the literature and mythology categories of questions of, and is otherwise active in the National Academic Quiz Tournaments (NAQT), a quiz bowl organization;[57] in particular, he moderated (i.e., read questions) at the 2005, 2006, and 2009 NAQT National High School Tournaments in Chicago.\\r\\nDuring his Jeopardy! winning streak, Jennings was a software engineer for CHG Healthcare Services, a healthcare-placement firm in Holladay, Utah.[58]\\r\\nJennings regularly competes in LearnedLeague under the name \\"JenningsK\\".[59]","input":"Who was the longest running player on jeopardy?"},{"output":"Over 2,500","context":"","input":"How many hungarians were killed in 1956 by soviet forces?"},{"output":"at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme) on 15 September 1916","context":"The development of tanks in World War I was a response to the stalemate that had developed on the Western Front. Although vehicles that incorporated the basic principles of the tank (armour, firepower, and all-terrain mobility) had been projected in the decade or so before the War, it was the alarmingly heavy casualties of the start of its trench warfare that stimulated development.[1][2] Research took place in both Great Britain and France, with Germany only belatedly following the Allies' lead.\\r\\nIn Great Britain, an initial vehicle, nicknamed Little Willie, was constructed at William Foster & Co., during August and September 1915.[3] The prototype of a new design that became the Mark I tank was demonstrated to the British Army on 2 February 1916. Although initially termed \\"Landships\\" by the Landships Committee, production vehicles were named \\"tanks\\", to preserve secrecy. The term was chosen when it became known that the factory workers at William Foster referred to the first prototype as \\"the tank\\" because of its resemblance to a steel water tank.\\r\\nThe French fielded their first tanks in April 1917 and ultimately produced far more tanks than all other combatants combined.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Germans, on the other hand, began development only in response to the appearance of Allied tanks on the battlefield. Whilst the Allies manufactured several thousand tanks during the War, Germany deployed only 20 of her own.[4]\\r\\nThe first tanks were mechanically unreliable. There were problems that caused considerable attrition rates during combat deployment and transit. The heavily shelled terrain was impassable to conventional vehicles, and only highly mobile tanks such as the Mark and FTs performed reasonably well. The Mark I's rhomboid shape, caterpillar tracks, and 26-foot (8?m) length meant that it could negotiate obstacles, especially wide trenches, that wheeled vehicles could not. Along with the tank, the first self-propelled gun (the British Gun Carrier Mk I) and the first armoured personnel carrier (the British Mk IX) were also constructed in World War I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conceptual roots of the tank go back to ancient times, with siege engines which were able to provide protection for troops moving up against stone walls or other fortifications. With the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the demonstrable power of steam, James Cowan presented a proposal for a Steam Powered Land Ram in 1855, towards the end of the Crimean War. Looking like a helmet on 'footed' Boydell wheels, early forerunners of the Pedrail wheel, it was essentially an armoured steam tractor equipped with cannon and rotating scythes sprouting from the sides. Lord Palmerston is said to have dismissed it as 'barbaric'.\\r\\nFrom 1904 to 1909, David Roberts, the engineer and managing director of Hornsby & Sons of Grantham, built a series of tractors using his patented 'chain-track' which were put through their paces by the British Army, a (small) section of which wanted to evaluate artillery tractors. At one point in 1908, Major William E. Donohue of the Mechanical Transport Committee remarked to Roberts that he should design a new machine with armour, capable of carrying its own gun. But, disheartened by years of ultimately fruitless tinkering for the Army, Roberts did not take up the idea. In later years he expressed regret at not having pursued it.[5]\\r\\nAn engineer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Lieutenant Gunther Burstyn, inspired by Holt tractors, designed a tracked armoured vehicle in 1911 carrying a light gun in a rotating turret; equipped also with hinged 'arms', two in front and two at the rear, carrying wheels on the ends to assist with obstacles and trenches, it was a very forward-looking design, if rather small. The Austrian government said it would be interested in evaluating it if Burstyn could secure commercial backing to produce a prototype. Lacking the requisite contacts, he let it drop. An approach to the German government was similarly fruitless.\\r\\nIn 1912, A South Australian, Lancelot De Mole, submitted a proposal to the British War Office for a \\"chain-rail vehicle which could be easily steered and carry heavy loads over rough ground and trenches\\". De Mole made several more proposals to the War Office after 1912, in 1914 and 1916, with a culminating proposal in late 1917, accompanied by a huge one-eighth scale model, yet all fell on substantially deaf ears. De Mole's proposal already had the climbing face, so typical of the later World War I British tanks, but it is unknown whether there was some connection. Inquiries from the government of Australia, after the war, yielded polite responses that Mr. De Mole's ideas had unfortunately been too advanced for the time to be properly recognised at their just value. The Commission on Awards to Inventors in 1919, which adjudicated all the competing claims to the development of the tank, recognised the brilliance of De Mole's design, even considering that it was superior to the machines actually developed, but due to its narrow remit, could only make a payment of S987 to De Mole to cover his expenses. De Mole noted in 1919 that he was urged by friends before the war to approach the Germans with his design, but declined to do so for patriotic reasons.\\r\\nBefore World War I, motorized vehicles were still relatively uncommon, and their use on the battlefield was initially limited, especially of heavier vehicles. Armoured cars soon became more commonplace with most belligerents, especially in more open terrain. On August 23, 1914, the French Colonel Jean Baptiste Eugne Estienne, later a major proponent of tanks, declared: Messieurs, la victoire appartiendra dans cette guerre  celui des deux belligrants qui parviendra le premier  placer un canon de 75 sur une voiture capable de se mouvoir en tout terrain (\\"Gentlemen, the victory will belong, in this war, to the one of the two belligerents who will be the first to succeed in mounting a 75 mm gun on a vehicle capable of moving in all types of terrain\\").\\r\\nArmored cars did indeed prove useful in open land such as in deserts, but were not very good at crossing obstacles (e.g. trenches, barriers) or in more challenging terrain. The other issue was that it was very hard to add much protection or armament.\\r\\nThe main limitation was the wheels, which gave a high ground pressure for the vehicle's weight. This could be solved by adding more wheels, but unless they also were driven, the effect was to reduce traction on the powered wheels. Driving extra wheels meant more drive train weight, in turn requiring a larger and heavier engine to maintain performance. Even worse, none of this extra weight was put into an improvement of armor or armament carried, and the vehicles were still incapable of crossing very rough terrain.\\r\\nThe adoption of caterpillar tracks offered a new solution to the problem. The tracks spread the weight of the vehicles over a much greater area, which was all used for traction to move the vehicle. The limitation on armor and firepower was no longer ground pressure but the power and weight of the power-plant.\\r\\nThe remaining issue was how to utilise and configure a vehicle. Major Ernest Dunlop Swinton RE, was the official British war correspondent serving in France in 1914. He recounts in his book Eyewitness how the idea of using caterpillar tracks to drive an armoured fighting vehicle came to him on October 19, 1914, while he was driving through northern France. In July 1914 he had received a letter from a friend, Hugh Marriott, a mining engineer, drawing his attention to a Holt caterpillar tractor that Marriott had seen in Belgium. Marriott thought it might be useful for transport over difficult ground, and Swinton had passed the information on to the appropriate departments. Now Swinton suggested the idea of an armoured tracked vehicle to the military authorities, by sending a proposal to Lieutenant-Colonel Maurice Hankey. Hankey in turn tried to interest Lord Kitchener in the idea; when this failed he sent a memorandum in December to the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which he was himself the secretary; Winston Churchill the First Lord of the Admiralty was one of the members of the committee. Hankey proposed to build a gigantic steel roller, pushed by tracked tractors, to shield the advancing infantry. Churchill in turn wrote a note on January 5 to the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, in which he warned that the Germans might any moment introduce a comparable system. A worried Asquith now ordered Kitchener to form a committee, headed by General Scott-Moncrieff, to study the feasibility of Swinton's idea; however, after trials with a Holt 75 h.p. machine the committee concluded in February 1915 that the idea was impractical.\\r\\nWinston Churchill however decided that if the Army wouldn't take up the idea, the Navy should proceed independently, even if it were to exceed the limits of his authority. He created the Landships Committee in February 1915, initially to investigate designs for a massive troop transporter. As a truer picture of front-line conditions was developed the aims of the investigation changed. A requirement was formulated for an armoured vehicle capable of 4?mph (6?km/h), climbing a 5 feet (1.5 m) high parapet, crossing an 8 feet (2.4 m) wide gap, and armed with machine guns and a light artillery piece. A similar proposal was working its way through the Army GHQ in France, and in June the Landships Committee was made a joint service venture between the War Office and the Admiralty. The Naval involvement in Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) design had originally come about through the Royal Naval Air Service Armoured Car Division, the only British unit fielding AFVs in 1914; surprisingly, until the end of the war most experimentation on heavy land vehicles was conducted by Royal Naval Air Service Squadron 20.\\r\\nAt first, protecting heavy gun tractors with armour appeared the most promising line of development. Alternative early 'big wheel' designs on the lines of the Russian tsar tank of 1915 were soon understood to be impractical. However, adapting the existing Holt Company caterpillar designs  the only robust tracked tractors available in 1915  into a fighting machine, as France and Germany did, was decided against. While armour and weapon systems were easy to acquire, other existing caterpillar and suspension units were too weak, existing engines were underpowered for the vehicles that the designers had in mind, and trench-crossing ability was poor because of the shortness of the wheelbase. The Killen-Strait tractor with three tracks was used for the first experiments in June but was much too small to be developed further. The large Pedrail monotrack vehicle proved to be unsuitable. Trials to couple two American Bullock tractors failed. There also were considerable differences of opinion between the several committee members. Col R.E.B. Crompton, a veteran military engineer and electrical pioneer, drafted numerous designs with Lucien Legros for armoured troop carrying vehicles and gun-armed vehicles, to have used either Bullock tracks or variants of the Pedrail. At the same time, Lt Robert Macfie, of the RNAS, and Albert Nesfield, an Ealing-based engineer, devised a number of armoured tracked vehicles, which incorporated an angled front 'climbing face' to the tracks. The two men fell out bitterly as their plans came to nought; Macfie in particular pursued a vendetta against the other members of the Landships Committee after the war.\\r\\nTo resolve the threatened dissipation of effort, it was ordered in late July that a contract was to be placed with William Foster & Co. Ltd, a company having done some prewar design work on heavy tractors and known to Churchill from an earlier experiment with a trench-crossing supply vehicle, to produce a proof-of-concept vehicle with two tracks, based on a lengthened Bullock tractor chassis. Construction work began three weeks later.\\r\\nFosters of Lincoln built the 14 ton \\"Little Willie\\", which first ran on 8 September. Powered by a 105?hp (78?kW) Daimler engine, the 10-foot-high (3.0?m) armoured box was initially fitted with a low Bullock caterpillar. A rotating top turret was planned with a 40?mm gun but abandoned due to weight problems, leaving the final vehicle unarmed and little more than a test-bed for the difficult track system. Difficulties with the commercial tracks supplied led to Tritton designing a completely new track system different from, and vastly more robust than, any other system then in use. The next design by Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson RNAS, a pre-war motor engineer, added a larger track frame to the hull of \\"Little Willie\\". In order to achieve the demanded gap clearance a rhomboidal shape was chosenstretching the form to improve the track footprint and climbing capacity. To keep a low centre of gravity the rotating turret design was dropped in favour of sponsons on the sides of the hull fitted with naval 6-pounder (57?mm) guns. A final specification was agreed on in late September for trials in early 1916, and the resulting 30 ton \\"Big Willie\\" (later called \\"Mother\\") together with \\"Little Willie\\" underwent trials at Hatfield Park on 29 January and 2 February. Attendees at the second trial included Lord Kitchener, Lloyd George, Reginald McKenna and other political luminaries. On 12 February an initial order for 100 \\"Mother\\" type vehicles was made, later expanded to 150.\\r\\nAlthough landship was a natural term coming from an Admiralty committee, it was considered too descriptive and could give away British intentions. The committee therefore looked for an appropriate code term for the vehicles. Factory workers assembling the vehicles had been told they were producing \\"mobile water tanks\\" for desert warfare in Mesopotamia. Water Container was therefore considered but rejected because the committee would inevitably be known as the WC Committee (WC meaning water closet was a common British term for a toilet). The term tank, as in water tank, was in December 1915 finally accepted as its official designation. From then on, the term \\"tank\\" was established among British and also German soldiers. While in German Tank specifically refers to the World War I type (as opposed to modern Panzer), in English, Russian and other languages the name even for contemporary armoured vehicles is still based on the word tank.\\r\\nIt is sometimes mistakenly stated that, after completion, the tanks were shipped to France in large wooden crates. For secrecy and in order to not arouse any curiosity, the crates and the tanks themselves were then each labelled with a destination in Russian, \\"With Care to Petrograd\\". In fact the tanks were never shipped in crates: the inscription in Russian was applied on the hull for their transport from the factory to the first training centre at Thetford.\\r\\nThe first fifty had been delivered to France on 30 August. They were 'male' or 'female', depending upon whether their armament comprised two 6-pounder cannon and three Hotchkiss machine guns or four Vickers machine guns and one Hotchkiss. It had a crew of eight, four of whom were needed to handle the steering and drive gears. The tanks were capable of, at best, 6?km/h (4?mph), matching the speed of marching infantry with whom they were to be integrated to aid in the destruction of enemy machine guns. In practice, their speed on broken ground could be as little as 1?mph.\\r\\nAfter the war the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors decided that the principal inventors of the Tank were Sir William Tritton, managing director of Fosters, and Major Walter Gordon Wilson.\\r\\nThe first use of tanks on the battlefield was the use of British Mark I tanks at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme) on 15 September 1916, with mixed results; many broke down, but nearly a third succeeded in breaking through. Of the forty-nine tanks shipped to the Somme, only thirty-two were able to begin the first attack in which they were used and only nine made it across \\"no man's land\\" to the German lines. The tanks had been rushed into combat before the design was mature enough (against Churchill's and Ernest Swinton's wishes)[6] and the number was small but their use gave important feedback on how to design newer tanks, the soundness of the concept, and their potential to affect the course of the war. On the other hand, the French Army was critical of the British employment of small numbers of tanks at this battle. They felt the British had sacrificed the secrecy of the weapon while employing it in numbers too small to be decisive. Considering that the British attack was part of an Anglo-French offensive while the Russians were also attacking at the same time, Haig felt justified in making a maximum effort, regardless of the limitations of the tank force.\\r\\nThe Mark Is were capable of performing on the real battlefield of World War I, one of the most difficult battlefield terrains ever. They did have reliability problems, but when they were working they could cross trenches or craters of 9 feet (2.7 m) and drive right through barbed wire. It was still common for them to get stuck, especially in larger bomb craters, but overall the rhomboid shape allowed for extreme terrain mobility.\\r\\nMost World War I tanks could travel only at about a walking pace at best. Their steel armour could stop small arms fire and fragments from high-explosive artillery shells. However they were vulnerable to a direct hit from artillery and mortar shells. The environment inside was extremely unpleasant; as ventilation was inadequate the atmosphere was heavy with poisonous carbon monoxide from the engine and firing the weapons, fuel and oil vapours from the engine and cordite fumes from the weapons. Temperatures inside could reach 50C (122F). Entire crews lost consciousness inside the tanks, or collapsed when again exposed to fresh air.[7]\\r\\nTo counter the danger of bullet splash or fragments knocked off the inside of the hull, the crew wore helmets with goggles and chainmail masks. Gas masks were also standard issue, as they were to all soldiers at this point in the war due to the use of chemical warfare. The side armour of 8?mm initially made them largely immune to small arms fire, but could be penetrated by the recently developed armour-piercing K bullets. There was also the danger of being overrun by infantry and attacked with grenades. The next generation had thicker armour, making them nearly immune to the K bullets. In response, the Germans developed a larger purpose-made anti-tank rifle, and also a Geballte Ladung (\\"Bunched Charge\\")several regular stick grenades bundled together for a much bigger explosion.\\r\\nEngine power was a primary limitation on the tanks; the roughly one hundred horsepower engines gave a power-to-weight ratio of 3.3?hp/ton (2.5?kW/ton). By the end of the 20th century, power-to-weight ratios exceeded 20?hp/ton (15?kW/ton).\\r\\nMany feel that because the British Commander Field Marshal Douglas Haig was himself a horse cavalryman, his command failed to appreciate the value of tanks. In fact, horse cavalry doctrine in World War I was to \\"follow up a breakthrough with harassing attacks in the rear\\", but there were no breakthroughs on the Western Front until the tanks came along. Despite these supposed views of Haig, he made an order for 1,000 tanks shortly after the failure at the Somme and always remained firmly in favour of further production.\\r\\nIn 1919, Major General Sir Louis Jackson said: \\"The tank was a freak. The circumstances which called it into existence were exceptional and not likely to recur. If they do, they can be dealt with by other means.\\"[8]\\r\\nFrance at the same time developed its own tracked AFVs, but the situation there was very different. In Britain a single committee had coordinated design, and had to overcome the initial resistance of the Army, while the major industries remained passive. Almost all production effort was thus concentrated into the Mark I and its direct successors, all very similar in shape. In France, on the other hand, there were multiple and conflicting lines of development which were badly integrated, resulting in three major and quite disparate production types. A major arms producer, Schneider, took the lead in January 1915 and tried to build a first armoured vehicle based on the Baby Holt tractor but initially the development process was slow until in July they received political, even presidential, support by combining their project with that of a mechanical wire cutter devised by engineer and politician Jean-Louis Brton. In December 1915, the influential Colonel Estienne made the Supreme Command very enthusiastic about the idea of creating an armoured force based on these vehicles; strong Army support for tanks was a constant during the decades that followed. Already in January and February 1916 quite substantial orders were made, at that moment with a total number of 800 much larger than the British ones.\\r\\nArmy enthusiasm and haste had its immediate drawbacks however. As a result of the involvement of inexperienced army officers ordered to devise a new tank based on the larger 75?hp Holt chassis in a very short period of time, the first French tanks were poorly designed with respect to the need to cross trenches and did not take the sponson-mounting route of the British tanks. The first, the Char Schneider CA equipped with a short 75?mm howitzer, had poor mobility due to a short track length combined with a hull that overhung front and rear. It was unreliable as well; a maximum of only about 130 of the 400 built were ever operational at the same time. Then industrial rivalry began to play a detrimental role: it created the heavy Char St Chamond, a parallel development not ordered by the Army but approved by government through industrial lobby, which mounted much more impressive weaponry  its 75?mm was the most powerful gun fielded by any operational tank up till 1941  but also combined many of the Schneider CA's faults with an even larger overhanging body. Its innovative petro-electrical transmission, while allowing for easy steering, was insufficiently developed and led to a large number of breakdowns.\\r\\nBut industrial initiative also led to swift advances. The car industry, already used to vehicle mass production and having much more experience in vehicle layout, in 1916 designed the first practical light tanks, a class largely neglected by the British. It was Renault's excellent small tank design, the FT, incorporating a proper climbing face for the tracks, that was the first tank to incorporate a top-mounted turret with a full 360 traverse capability. In fact the FT was in many respects the first truly 'modern' tank having a layout that has been followed by almost all designs ever since: driver at the front; main armament in a fully rotating turret on top; engine at the rear. Previous models had been \\"box tanks\\", with a single crowded space combining the role of engine room, fighting compartment, ammunition stock and driver's cabin. (A very similar Peugeot prototype, with a fixed casemate mounting a short 75mm cannon, was trialled in 1918 but the idea was not pursued). The FT had the largest production run of any tank of the war, with over 3700 built, more numerous than all British tanks combined. That this would happen was at first far from certain; some in the French army lobbied for the alternative mass production of super-heavy tanks. Much design effort was put in this line of development resulting in the gigantic Char 2C, the most complex and technologically advanced tank of its day. Its very complexity ensured it being produced too late to participate in World War I and in the very small number of just ten, but it was the first tank with a three-man turret; the heaviest to enter service until late in World War II and still the largest ever operational.\\r\\nFrench production at first lagged behind the British. After August 1916 however, British tank manufacture was temporarily halted to wait for better designs, allowing the French to overtake their allies in numbers. When the French used tanks for the first time on 16 April 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, they had four times more tanks available. But that did not last long as the offensive was a major failure; the Schneiders were badly deployed and suffered 50% losses from German long-range artillery. The Saint-Chamond tanks, first deployed on 5 May, proved to be so badly designed that they were unable to cross the first line of German trenches.\\r\\nThe first battle in which tanks made a great impact was the Battle of Cambrai in 1917. British Colonel J.F.C. Fuller, chief of staff of the Tank Corps, was responsible for the tanks' role in the battle. They made an unprecedented breakthrough but, as ever on the Western front, the opportunity was not exploited. Ironically, it was the soon-to-be-supplanted horse cavalry that had been assigned the task of following up the motorised tank attack.\\r\\nTanks became more effective as the lesson of the early tanks was absorbed. The British produced the Mark IV in 1917. Similar to the early Marks in appearance, its construction was considered to produce a more reliable machine, the long-barrelled naval guns were shortened (the barrels of the earlier, longer guns were prone to digging in the mud when negotiating obstacles) and armour was increased just enough to defeat the standard German armour-piercing bullet.\\r\\nThe continued need for four men to drive the tank was solved with the Mark V which used Wilson's epicyclic gearing in 1918. Also in 1918 the French produced the Renault FT, the result of a co-operation between Estienne and Louis Renault. As mentioned before, it had the innovative turret position, and was operated by two men. At just 8 tons it was half the weight of the Medium A Whippet but the version with the cannon had more firepower. It was conceived for mass production, and the FT became the most produced tank of World War I by a wide margin, with over 3,000 delivered to the French Army. Large numbers were used by the Americans and several were also lent to the British.\\r\\nIn July 1918, the French used 480 tanks (mostly FTs) at the Battle of Soissons, and there were even larger assaults planned for 1919. The Entente had hoped to commit over 30,000 tanks to battle in that year.\\r\\nFinally, in a preview of later developments, the British developed the Whippet. This tank was specifically designed to exploit breaches in the enemy front with its relatively higher speed (around 8mph vs 3-4mph for the British heavy tanks). The Whippet was faster than most other tanks, although it carried only machine gun armament, meaning it was not suited to combat with armoured vehicles but instead with infantry. Postwar tank designs reflected this trend towards greater tactical mobility.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe German General Staff did not have enthusiasm for the tanks, but allowed the development of anti-tank weapons. Regardless, development of a German tank was under way. The only project to be produced and fielded was the A7V, although only twenty were built. The majority of the fifty or so tanks fielded by Germany were captured British vehicles. A7Vs were captured by the Allies, but they were not used, and most ended up being scrapped.\\r\\nThe first tank-versus-tank battles took place 24 April 1918. It was an unexpected engagement between three German A7Vs and three British Mk. IVs at Villers-Bretonneux.\\r\\nFuller's Plan 1919, involving massive use of tanks for an offensive, was never used because the blockade of Germany and the entry of the US brought an end to the war.","input":"When was the tank first used in ww1?"},{"output":"Hebrew","context":"Benjamin is a popular given name for males, derived from Hebrew ????????????, Binymؐn, translating as \\"Son of my right [hand]\\", though in the Samaritan Pentateuch, the name appears as ??????, \\"Binyaamem\\" \\"Son of my days\\".

Martial law is declared either when there is near-violent civil unrest or in cases of major natural disasters, however most countries use a different legal construct like \\"state of emergency\\".\\r\\nTypically, the imposition of martial law accompanies curfews, the suspension of civil law, civil rights, habeas corpus, and the application or extension of military law or military justice to civilians. Civilians defying martial law may be subjected to military tribunals (court-martial).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHostilities that began the Philippine Revolution of 1896 started on the evening of 21 August 1896, when hundreds of rebels attacked the Civil Guard garrison in Pasig, just as hundreds of other rebels personally led by Andrs Bonifacio were massing in San Juan del Monte, which they attacked hours later on the 30th. Bonifacio planned to capture El Polvorin, the San Jose del Monte powder magazine along with El Dep܇sito, a water station supplying Manila. The defending Spaniards were outnumbered, but fought the rebels until reinforcements arrived. Once reinforced, the Spaniards drove Bonifacio's forces back with heavy casualties. Elsewhere rebels attacked Mandaluyong, Sampaloc, Santa Ana, Pandacan, Pateros, Marikina, and Caloocan,[1] as well as Makati and Taguig.[2] Balintawak in Caloocan saw intense fighting. Rebel troops tended to gravitate towards fighting in San Juan del Monte and Sampaloc. South of Manila, a thousand-strong rebel force attacked a small force of civil guards. In Pandacan Katipuneros attacked the parish church, making the parish priest run for his life.[2]\\r\\nAfter their defeat in San Juan del Monte, Bonifacio's troops regrouped near Marikina, San Mateo and Montalban, where they proceeded to attack these areas. They captured these areas but were driven back by Spanish counterattacks, and Bonifacio eventually ordered a retreat to Balara. On the way, Bonifacio was nearly killed shielding Emilio Jacinto from a Spanish bullet that grazed his collar.[2] Despite his reverses, Bonifacio was not completely defeated and was still considered a threat.[1]\\r\\nNorth of Manila, the towns of San Francisco de Malabon, Noveleta and Kawit in Cavite rose in rebellion.[2] In Nueva Ecija rebels in San Isidro led by Ivan Pilien attacked the Spanish garrison on September 2ÿ4; they were repulsed.[3]\\r\\nBy 30 August, the revolt had spread to eight provinces, prompting the Spanish Governor-General Ram܇n Blanco, 1st Marquis of Pe?a Plata, to declare a \\"state of war\\" in these provinces and place them under martial law. These provinces were Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Pampanga, Tarlac, Laguna, Batangas, and Nueva Ecija.[4][2] These would later be represented in the eight rays of the Sun in the Philippine flag.[5] Despite such declaration, which provided a 48-hour period in giving amnesty to rebels except their leaders, Blanco adopted a cool, conciliatory stance, seeking to improve Spains image in the face of world opinion.[6]\\r\\nAfter the outbreak of SpanishÿAmerican War, Emilio Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines from his exile in Hong Kong on 19 May 1898, with 13 of his staff. He was encouraged to return by the Americans, who saw in him as an opportunity in their war against Spain.[7] After five days, on May 23, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation in which he assumed command of all Philippine military forces and established a dictatorial government with himself as the supreme commander.[8]\\r\\nOn 12 June, at Aguinaldo's ancestral home in Cavite, Philippine independence was proclaimed and The Act of Declaration of Philippine Independence was read. The act had been prepared and written in Spanish by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, who also read its proclamation.[9] On 18 June, issued a decree formally establishing his dictatorial government.[10] On 23 June another decree signed by Aguinaldo was issued, replacing the Dictatorial Government with a Revolutionary Government, with himself as President.[11][12]\\r\\nPresident Jos P. Laurel of the wartime Second Philippine Republic placed the Philippines under martial law in 1944 through Proclamation No. 29, dated September 21. Martial law came into effect on September 22, 1944. Proclamation No. 30 was issued the next day, declaring the existence of a state of war between the Philippines and the US and Great Britain. This took effect on September 23, 1944.\\r\\nAround 1970, student activism had intensified and many student activists joined communist movements. Kabataang Makabayan (Patriotic Youth, or 'KM') a political organization founded by Jos Mara Sison intended to be a nationwide extension of the Student Cultural Association of the University of the Philippines,[13][14] carried out study sessions on MarxismÿLeninism and intensified the deployment of urban activists in rural areas to prepare for People's war.[15][16] The line between leftist activists and communists became increasingly blurred, as a significant number of KM advanced activists joined the party of the Communist Party also founded by Sison.[15] Earlier, during the campaign period for the 1969 elections, students called promoted a mock campaign called the Dante-for-President movement, likely referring to New People's Army founder Bernabe 'Kumander Dante' Buscayno.[17] KM members protested in front of Congress, throwing a coffin, a stuffed alligator, and stones at Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos after his State of the Nation Address. On the presidential palace, activists rammed the gate with a fire truck and once the gate broke and gave way, the activists charged into the Palace grounds tossing rocks, pillboxes, Molotov cocktails. In front of the US embassy, protesters vandalized, arsoned and damaged the embassy lobby resulting to a strong protest from the U.S. Ambassador.[15][17][18] The KM protests ranged from 50,000 to 100,000 in number per weekly mass action.[15] In the aftermath of the January 1970 riots, at least two activists were confirmed dead and several were injured by the police. The Mayor of Manila at the time, Antonio Villegas, commended the Manila Police District for their \\"exemplary behavior and courage\\" and protecting the First Couple long after they have left. The death of the activists was seized by the L܇pez-controlled Manila Times and Manila Chronicle, blaming Marcos and added fire to the weekly protests.[19] Students declared a week-long boycott of classes and instead met to organize protest rallies.[17]\\r\\nIn Marcos' diary,[18][19] he wrote that the whole crisis has been utilized by communism to create a revolutionary situation. He lamented that the powerful Lopez family, which controlled Manila Times and Manila Chronicle, blamed him for the riots thus raising the ire of demonstrators. He mentioned that he was informed by his mother of a planned assassination paid for by the powerful oligarch, Eugenio Lopez Sr (I?ing Lopez). He narrated how he dissuaded his supporters from the Northern Philippines in infiltrating the demonstration in Manila and inflicting harm on the protesters, and how he showed to the UP professors that the Collegian was carrying the communist party articles and that he was disappointed in the faculty of his alma matter for becoming a spawning ground of communism. He also added that he asked Ernesto Rufino, Vicente Rufino and Carlos Palanca to withdraw advertisements from the Manila Times which was openly supporting revolution and the communist cause, and they agreed to do so.\\r\\nRumors of coup detat were also brewing. A report of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that shortly after the Philippine presidential election, 1969, a group composed mostly of retired colonels and generals organized a revolutionary junta with the aim of first discrediting President Marcos and then killing him. The group was headed by Eleuterio Adevoso, an official of the opposition Liberal party. As described in a document given to the committee by Philippine Government official, key figures in the plot were Vice President Fernando Lopez and Sergio Osmena Jr., whom Marcos defeated in the 1969 election.[20] Marcos even went to the U.S. embassy to dispel rumors that the U.S. embassy is supporting a coup detat which the opposition liberal party was spreading.[19] While the report obtained by the NY Times speculated saying that story could be used by Marcos to justify Martial Law, as early as December 1969 in a message from the U.S. Ambassador to the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, the U.S. Ambassador said that most of the talk about revolution and even assassination has been coming from the defeated opposition, of which Adevoso (of the Liberal Party) is a leading activist. He also said that the information he has on the assassination plans are 'hard' or well-sourced and he has to make sure that it reached President Marcos.[21][22]\\r\\nIn light of the crisis, Marcos wrote an entry in his diary in January 1970:[19] \\"I have several options. One of them is to abort the subversive plan now by the sudden arrest of the plotters. But this would not be accepted by the people. Nor could we get the Huks (Communists), their legal cadres and support. Nor the MIM (Maoist International Movement) and other subversive [or front] organizations, nor those underground. We could allow the situation to develop naturally then after massive terrorism, wanton killings and an attempt at my assassination and a coup detat, then declare martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus ÿ and arrest all including the legal cadres. Right now I am inclined towards the latter.\\"\\r\\nAt the height of armed communist insurgency in the Philippines, Philippine Military Academy instructor Lt. Victor Corpuz led New People's Army rebels in a raid on the PMA armory, capturing rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, a bazooka and thousands of rounds of ammunition in 1970.[23] In 1972, China, which was then actively supporting and arming communist insurgencies in Asia as part of Mao Zedong's People's War Doctrine,[16] transported 1,200 M-14 and AK-47 rifles[24] for the NPA to speed up NPA's campaign to defeat the government.[25][26] Prior to the 1975, the Philippine government maintained a close relationship with the Kuomintang-ruled Chinese government which fled to Taiwan (Republic of China), despite the Chinese Communist Victory in 1949, and saw Communist China (People's Republic of China) as a security threat due to China's financial and military support of Communist rebels in the country.[27] In a speech in February 2017 at the Methodist Protestants Cosmopolitan Church in Manila, Enrile said: The most significant event that made President Marcos decide to declare martial law was the MV Karagatan incident in July 1972. It was the turning point. The MV Karagatan involved the infiltration of high powered rifles, ammunition, 40-millimeter rocket launchers, rocket projectiles, communications equipment, and other assorted war materials by the CPP-NPA-NDF on the Pacific side of Isabela in Cagayan Valley. The CPP-NPA-NDF attempted a second effort ÿ their MV Andrea project ÿ but they failed. The MV Andrea sank in the West Philippine Sea on its way to the country.[28] Those who opposed President Marcos, including The Conjugal Dictatorship author Primitivo Mijares, the Liberal Party, as well as the L܇pezes Manila Chronicle, called the MV Karagatan incident as \\"show' or a hoax.[29][28]\\r\\nIn a speech before Senate, Benigno Aquino, Jr. warned the public of the possible establishment of a garrison state by President Ferdinand Marcos. President Marcos imposed martial law on the nation from 1972 to 1981 to suppress increasing civil strife and the threat of a communist takeover following a series of bombings in Manila.[30][31] Aquino himself had contact with leaders of Communist Party of the Philippines  first with founder Jose Maria Sison, and later with Rodolfo Salas, CPP chair at the height of Martial Law. In an interview with Ateneo De Manila University Professor Lisandro Claudio, Salas said not only did he bring wounded New People's Army (NPA) soldiers to Aquinos houses, but he received guns and cash from Aquino himself. In another communication to the State Department dated September 21, the US Embassy sheds further light on what Ninoy told the American officials. On September 12, Ninoy had a lengthy luncheon conversation\\" with two embassy officers about the growing strength of Communist dissidence in the Philippines.\\" In this luncheon, the senator readily admitted his past ties with the several Communist factions in the Philippines.\\" He claimed that maintaining links with Huk rebels was a fact of life\\" for a Tarlac politician.[32][33] In the Philippine parliamentary election, 1978, the first parliamentary election during Martial Law, Ninoy fielded in his Lakas ng Bayan party Alex Boncayao, who was associated with Filipino communist death squad Alex Boncayao Brigade.[34][35] All of the party's 21 candidates, including Ninoy, lost in the election.\\r\\nOn 21 August 1971, while the opposition (Liberal Party) was having their miting de avance in Plaza Miranda, 2 fragmentation grenades exploded.[citation needed] It took 9 lives and left more than 100 people seriously wounded.[citation needed] Some Liberal Party candidates were seriously injured including Jovito Salonga, who nearly died and was visually impaired. Suspicion of responsibility for the blast initially fell upon Marcos, whom the Liberals blamed for the bombing; however, in later years, prominent personalities associated with the event have laid the blame on the Communist Party of the Philippines under Jos Mara Sison.[36] In his autobiography, Salonga states his belief that Sison and the CPP were responsible.[37] Based on interviews of The Washington Post with former Communist Party of the Philippines Officials, it was revealed that \\"the (Communist) party leadership planned -- and three operatives carried out -- the attack in an attempt to provoke government repression and push the country to the brink of revolution... (Communist Party Leader) Sison had calculated that Marcos could be provoked into cracking down on his opponents, thereby driving thousands of political activists into the underground, the former party officials said. Recruits were urgently needed, they said, to make use of a large influx of weapons and financial aid that China had already agreed to provide.\\"[38]\\r\\nA month of \\"terrorist bombings\\" of public facilities in Manila and Quezon City culminated on 22 September with a staged assassination attempt on Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile. Six hours after the alleged assassination attempt against Enrile and citing more than 15 bombing incidences, chaos and lawlessness, Marcos issued Proclamation No. 1081, declaring and imposing martial law in the entire country.[39] By declaring martial law, Marcos suspended the writ of habeas corpus and also the 1935 Constitution, dissolved Congress and padlocked the doors to the Batasang Pambansa, and assuming both legislative and executive powers. Proclamation No. 1081 was dated 21 September 1972 but it was actually signed on 17 September. The formal announcement or promulgation of the proclamation was made only at seven-thirty in the evening of 23 September, evidencing the plan to declare martial law even before the supposed ambush against Enrile. He had also commanded his military collaborators to start arresting his political opponents and close down all media and retail (fashion, food, religious, sports) establishments about twenty-two hours before the announcement.[40]\\r\\nThe Proclamation read in part\\r\\nThe declaration of Martial Law was criticized as a planned precursor to extending Marcos' term in office, which under the 1935 Constitution is limited to two terms of four years each or a maximum of eight years[41] Rigoberto Tiglao, former press secretary and a former communist incarcerated during the martial law,[42] countered by arguing that the liberal and communist parties provoked martial law imposition.[43]\\r\\nMartial law was ratified by 90.77% of the voters during the Philippine Martial Law referendum, 1973 though the referendum was marred with controversy. Primitivo Mijares, a Marcos detractor and author of the book Conjugal dictatorship,[44] alleged that there could not have been any valid referendum held from January 10 to 15, 1973 claiming the 35,000 citizen's assemblies never met and that voting was by show of hands.[45][46] The 1935 Constitution was replaced with the 1972 Constitution after the new constitution was ratified by 95% of the voters in the Philippine constitutional plebiscite, 1973. The Supreme Court affirmed the ratification of the 1972 Constitution in the case of Javellana vs. Executive Secretary, where the majority of the justices noted that while the 1972 Constitution was improperly ratified because it did not follow the procedure in the 1935 Constitution, there was no stopping the reality that the 1972 Constitution was already in effect.[47] This decision became the cornerstone of subsequent decisions whenever the validity of the 1973 Constitution was questioned.\\r\\nUnder martial law there were widespread excesses and human rights abuses, even while the regime reduced violent urban crime, collect unregistered firearms, and suppress communist insurgency in some areas;[48] Liliosa Hilao was the first murder victim under Martial Law.[49] There were over 70,000 filed cases of human rights abuses today from this period. Torture methods employed by the army on their victims were extremely inhumane, which included beating, rape, electrocution, animal treatment, and mutilation among others. Many private establishments particularly media companies critical of the government were closed, and the arrest of activists were made through the Philippine Constabulary; many of the abuses were attributed to the latter, which was then headed by future president Fidel Ramos.[50] In total, there were 3,257 extrajudicial killings, 35,000 individual tortures, and 70,000 were incarcerated. Of the 3,257 killed, some 2,520, or 77 percent of all victims, were salvagedthat is, tortured, mutilated, and dumped on a roadside for public display. It is also reported that 737 Filipinos disappeared between 1975 and 1985.[51] The Civilian Home Defense Force, a precursor of Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU), was organized by President Marcos to battle with the communist and Islamic insurgency problem, has particularly been accused of notoriously inflicting human right violations on leftists, the NPA, Muslim insurgents, and rebels against the Marcos government.[52]\\r\\nAfter martial law was declared, critics of the government were arrested, led by then Senators Benigno Aquino Jr. and Ramon Diokno, and Manila journalistsManila Times publisher Chino Roces and columnist, Max Soliven; Manila Chronicle publisher Eugenio Lopez Jr. and his editor Amando Doronila; Philippines Free publisher-editor Teddy Boy Locsin and his staff writer, Napoleon Rama; and Press Foundation of Asia joint executive Juan L. Mercado.[53] Many of those who were arrested were later freed without charges, but Benigno Aquino Jr. was charged and convicted guilty along with his two co-accused, NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, guilty for illegal possession of fire arms, subversion, and murder, and was sentenced them to death by firing squad by a Military Court. The death sentence was never carried out by the Marcos government.[54]\\r\\nThere was some controversy whether the ambush on Enrile used as one of the justifications[31] to declare Martial Law was staged. However, Enrile himself denied that it was staged in his memoir and defended the declaration of martial law:[55]\\r\\nThe government captured NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno in 1976 and Jose Maria Sison in 1977.[57] The Washington Post in an interview with former Philippine Communist Party Officials, revealed that, \\"they (local communist party officials) wound up languishing in China for 10 years as unwilling \\"guests\\" of the (Chinese) government, feuding bitterly among themselves and with the party leadership in the Philippines\\".[58][59]\\r\\nMartial law was lifted by President Marcos on January 17, 1981,[60] and he continued to rule the country until 1986 when he went to exile after the People Power Revolution.\\r\\nOn December 4, 2009, through Proclamation No. 1959, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo officially placed Maguindanao province under a state of martial law, thereby suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.[61] Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita said the step was taken in order to avert the escalation of \\"lawless\\" violence in the province and pave the way for the swift arrest of the suspects in the massacre.[62][63] Following the declaration, authorities carried out a raid on a warehouse owned by Andal Ampatuan Jr.[64] The raid resulted in the confiscation of more than 330,000 rounds of 5.56G45mm NATO ammunition, a Humvee, and an improvised armored vehicle. Twenty militiamen were arrested on the premises. Captain James Nicolas of Special Forces was able to retrieve more high powered firearms and ammo after the incident.[65] The state of martial law in Maguindanao was lifted on December 13, 2009.\\r\\nAmid the escalation of conflicts in Mindanao and recent clashes in Marawi City related to the Maute Group, incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte placed Mindanao and its nearby islands under martial law at 10:00?p.m. (UTC+8) on May 23, 2017.[66] This was announced during a briefing held in Moscow, where President Duterte was on an official visit, and will be in effect for 60 days. Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the declaration was possible given the \\"existence of rebellion,\\" while Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano explained that the step was taken with of \\"the safety, the lives and property of people of Mindanao\\" in mind.[67] Implementation is to be pursuant to the 1987 Constitution, which provides for a maximum 60 day-state of martial law without Congress approval for extension, the continuation of government functions, and the safeguard of individual freedoms. However, President Duterte insisted that it will not be any different from martial law under President Marcos.[68]\\r\\nWhile the declaration does not currently affect citizens and government units in Luzon or the Visayas, President Duterte suggested that he might extend martial law to the entire country if needed to \\"protect the people.\\"[69]","input":"What does martial law mean in the philippines?"},{"output":"April 17, 1982","context":"The Canada Act 1982 (1982 c. 11) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that was passed (as stated in the preamble) at the request of the Parliament of Canada, to \\"patriate\\" Canada's constitution, ending the power of the British Parliament to amend the Constitution of Canada. The Act also formally ended the \\"request and consent\\" provisions of the Statute of Westminster 1931 in relation to Canada, whereby the British parliament had a general power to pass laws extending to Canada at its own request.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnexed as Schedule B to the Act is the text of the Constitution Act, 1982, in both of Canada's official languages (i.e. English and French).  Because of the requirements of official bilingualism, the body of the Canada Act itself is also set out in French in Schedule A to the Act, which is declared by s. 3 to have \\"the same authority in Canada as the English version thereof\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's modern political history as a union of previously separate provinces began with the British North America Act, 1867 (currently officially called in Canada the Constitution Act, 1867).[2] This act combined the Province of Canada (now Ontario and Quebec) with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into a Dominion within the British Empire.[2] Canada adopted a Westminster style government with a Parliament of Canada. A Governor General fulfilled the constitutional duties of the British Sovereign on Canadian soil. Similar arrangements applied within each province.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this autonomy, the United Kingdom still had the power to legislate for Canada. The Statute of Westminster 1931 removed this power of the British Parliament for Canada,[3] as well as for the other British Dominions (Australia [adopted 1942], the Irish Free State, New Zealand [adopted 1947], the Union of South Africa, and the Dominion of Newfoundland [never ratified, joined Canada in 1949]), unless (sec. 4) the Dominion requested and consented to Imperial legislation. Also, the British North America (No. 2) Act, 1949 was passed by the British Parliament, giving the Parliament of Canada significant constitutional amending powers.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, with Canada's agreement at the time, under the Statute of Westminster (sec. 7(1)) the British Parliament also retained  the power to amend the key Canadian constitutional statutes, namely the British North America Acts.[5][6][7] In effect, an Act of the British Parliament was  required to make certain changes to the Canadian constitution.[8] Delay in the patriation of the Canadian constitution was due in large part to the lack of agreement concerning a method for amending the constitution that would be acceptable to all of the provinces, particularly Quebec.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canada Act 1982 was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in response to the request from the Parliament of Canada to take over authority for amending its own constitution.[10] [11] After unpromising negotiations with the provincial governments, Pierre Trudeau proclaimed that the federal Parliament would unilaterally patriate the constitution. After numerous references by the provinces, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Patriation Reference that provincial consent was not legally necessary, but to do so without substantial consent would be contrary to a longstanding constitutional convention.[12] Trudeau succeeded in convincing nine provinces out of ten by agreeing to the addition of a Notwithstanding Clause to limit the application of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms[13] as a result of discussions during a First Ministers' conference and other minor changes in November 1981.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, 44 Members of Parliament voted against the Act, including 24 Conservative and 16 Labour MP's, citing concerns over Canada's past mistreatment of Quebec and Aboriginal peoples (as recalled with frustration by Jean Chrtien in his memoirs Straight from the Heart); overall there was little opposition from the British government to passing the Act.[citation needed]  However, new research into documents of the Thatcher government indicate that Britain had serious concerns about the inclusion of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms within the Canada Act.  Part of this concern stemmed from letters of protest the British received about it from provincial actors, but also because the Charter undermined the principle of parliamentary supremacy, which until that time had always been a core feature of every government practising the Westminster system.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough section 2 of the Canada Act 1982, the United Kingdom ended its involvement with further amendments to the Canadian constitution.[16] The procedure for amending the Constitution Act, 1982 must comply with its Part V, instead of the usual parliamentary procedure requiring the monarch's Royal Assent for enacting legislation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Canada Act 1982 received royal assent on March 29, 1982 in London, it was not until the Queen visited Canada the following month [17] that the Constitution Act, 1982, its Canadian equivalent, was proclaimed by letters patent as a statutory instrument by the Queen during her presence in Canada.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's Constitution Act, 1982 was signed into law by Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada on April 17, 1982 on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.[19][18] Queen Elizabeth's constitutional powers over Canada were not affected by the Act, and she remains Queen and Head of State of Canada.[20] Canada has complete sovereignty as an independent country, however, and the Queen's role as monarch of Canada is separate from her role as the British monarch or the monarch of any of the other Commonwealth realms.[21]","input":"When did canada become a completely independent country?"},{"output":"July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC","context":"\\r\\nApollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two humans on the Moon. Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin, both American, landed the lunar module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 pounds (21.5?kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rejoining Columbia in lunar orbit.\\r\\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 9:32 am EDT (13:32 UTC) and was the fifth manned mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages ÿ a lower stage for landing on the Moon, and an upper stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.\\r\\nAfter being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagle's upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.\\r\\nThe landing was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as \\"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by U.S. President John F. Kennedy: \\"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApollo 11 was the second all-veteran multi-person crew (the first being Apollo 10) in human spaceflight history.[8] A previous solo veteran flight had been made on Soyuz 1 in 1967 by Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov.[9]\\r\\nCollins was originally slated to be the Command Module Pilot (CMP) on Apollo 8 but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by Jim Lovell, his backup for that flight. After Collins was medically cleared, he took what would have been Lovell's spot on Apollo 11; as a veteran of Apollo 8, Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11's backup crew and promoted to backup commander.\\r\\nIn early 1969, Anders accepted a job with the National Space Council effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date. At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch (at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed) and would later join Lovell's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original Apollo 13 CMP.[10]\\r\\nAfter the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to Manned Spacecraft Center director George M. Low to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. During early mission planning, the names Snowcone and Haystack were used and put in the news release,[11] but the crew later decided to change them.\\r\\nThe Command Module was named Columbia after the Columbiad, the giant cannon shell \\"spacecraft\\" fired by a giant cannon (also from Florida) in Jules Verne's 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon.[12] The Lunar Module was named Eagle for the national bird of the United States, the bald eagle, which is featured prominently on the mission insignia.\\r\\nThe Apollo 11 mission insignia was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for \\"peaceful lunar landing by the United States\\". He chose an eagle as the symbol, put an olive branch in its beak, and drew a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. NASA officials said the talons of the eagle looked too \\"warlike\\" and after some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the claws. The crew decided the Roman numeral XI would not be understood in some nations and went with \\"Apollo 11\\"; they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would \\"be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing\\".[13] All colors are natural, with blue and gold borders around the patch.\\r\\nWhen the Eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.[14] The design was also used for the smaller Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979, ten years after the Apollo 11 mission.[15]\\r\\nNeil Armstrong's personal preference kit carried a piece of wood from the Wright brothers' 1903 airplane's left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing,[16] along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given to Deke Slayton by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on Apollo 1 and given to Slayton after the mission but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton and Armstrong took it on Apollo 11.[17]\\r\\nIn addition to many people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information Jack King providing commentary. President Richard M. Nixon viewed the proceedings from the Oval Office of the White House.\\r\\nA Saturn V launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00?a.m. EDT local time). It entered Earth orbit, at an altitude of 100.4 nautical miles (185.9?km) by 98.9 nautical miles (183.2?km), twelve minutes later.[1] After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed: this involved separating the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) from the spent rocket stage, turning around, and docking with the Lunar Module still attached to the stage. After the Lunar Module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into orbit around the Sun.[4]\\r\\nOn July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. In the thirty orbits[18] that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) about 12 miles (19?km) southwest of the crater Sabine D (0.67408N, 23.47297E). The landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers along with the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or extravehicular activity (EVA) challenges.[19]\\r\\nOn July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module Eagle separated from the Command Module Columbia. Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.\\r\\nAs the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface four seconds early and reported that they were \\"long\\"; they would land miles west of their target point.\\r\\nFive minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800?m) above the surface of the Moon, the LM navigation and guidance computer distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected \\"1202\\" and \\"1201\\" program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, computer engineer Jack Garman told guidance officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated \\"executive overflows\\", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.[20]\\r\\nDue to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing?... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones?... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.[21][a]\\r\\nWhen Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300-meter (980?ft) diameter crater (later determined to be West crater, named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse). Armstrong took semi-automatic control[26] and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.[5]\\r\\nApollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.[5]\\r\\nThroughout the descent, Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the LM. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67-inch (170?cm) probes hanging from Eagle's footpads had touched the surface, and he said: \\"Contact light!\\" Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong said \\"Shutdown.\\" Aldrin immediately said \\"Okay, engine stop. ACA ÿ out of detent.\\" Armstrong acknowledged \\"Out of detent. Auto\\" and Aldrin continued \\"Mode control ÿ both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm ÿ off. 413 is in.\\"\\r\\nCharles Duke, CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying \\"We copy you down, Eagle.\\"\\r\\nArmstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with \\"Engine arm is off\\", before responding to Duke with the words, \\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\\" Armstrong's unrehearsed[27] change of call sign from \\"Eagle\\" to \\"Tranquility Base\\" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful. Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: \\"Roger, Twan Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.\\"[5][28]\\r\\nTwo and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:\\r\\nThis is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.[29]\\r\\nHe then took communion privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair (who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church, and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, the Rev. Dean Woodruff. Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of Guideposts magazine and in his book Return to Earth. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.[30]\\r\\nThe schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period as they had been awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.\\r\\nThe astronauts planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP)[31] and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle's twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60 field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.[32][33]\\r\\nSeveral books indicate early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin rather than Neil Armstrong as the first man on the Moon.[34]\\r\\nAt 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle's side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface.[35][36] The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture.[37] The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia.[38] Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth.[39] Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.\\r\\nWhile still on the ladder, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM Descent Stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:\\r\\nHere men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\\r\\nAfter describing the surface dust as \\"very fine-grained\\" and \\"almost like a powder,\\"[36] six and a half hours after landing,[1] Armstrong stepped off Eagle's footpad and declared, \\"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\\"[b][40][41][42][43]\\r\\nArmstrong intended to say \\"That's one small step for a man\\", but the word \\"a\\" is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said \\"for a man\\", and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the \\"a\\" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words \\"for a\\" together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the \\"a\\" may have been spoken but obscured by static.[44][45]\\r\\nAbout seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.[46]\\r\\nTwelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected,[1] Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface, and described the view with the simple phrase, \\"Magnificent desolation.\\"[36]\\r\\nIn addition to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s,[47] Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod 68 feet (21?m) from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.\\r\\nArmstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity, one-sixth of Earth's, was \\"even perhaps easier than the simulations?... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around.\\"[36] Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backwards, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle's shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.[36]\\r\\nThe astronauts planted a specially designed U.S. flag on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Some time later, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called \\"the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.\\"[48] Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, to respect the lunar landing as Kennedy's legacy.[49] Armstrong thanked the President, and gave a brief reflection on the significance of the moment:\\r\\nNixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.\\r\\nArmstrong: Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States, but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and curiosity, and men with a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.\\r\\nThe MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.\\r\\nThey deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a Lunar Ranging Retroreflector (LRRR). Then Armstrong walked 196 feet (60?m) from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes ÿ the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes.\\r\\nThree new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.\\r\\nDuring this period, Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. However, as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.[50] In a 2010 interview, Armstrong, who had walked a maximum of 196 feet (60?m) from the LM, explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.[51]\\r\\nAldrin entered Eagle first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5?lb) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.[52]\\r\\nPresident Nixon's speech writer William Safire had prepared In Event of Moon Disaster for the President to read on television in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon.[53] The contingency plan originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster.[54][55] According to the plan, Mission Control would \\"close down communications\\" with the LM, and a clergyman would \\"commend their souls to the deepest of the deep\\" in a public ritual likened to burial at sea. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke's First World War poem, \\"The Soldier\\".[55] The plan included presidential telephone calls to the astronauts' wives.\\r\\nWhile moving within the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.[52] Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.[56]\\r\\nAfter about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle's ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.\\r\\nAfter more than 21? total hours on the lunar surface, they had left behind scientific instruments that included a retroreflector array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.[57] (In his 1989 book, Men from Earth, Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book Moonshot, Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.\\r\\nFilm taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some 25 feet (8?m) from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple:[1] \\"The ascent stage of the LM separated?... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over.\\"[18] Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least 100 feet (30?m) from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.\\r\\nAfter rendezvous with Columbia, Eagle's ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on July 21, 1969, at 23:41 UTC. Just before the Apollo 12 flight, it was noted that Eagle was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that Eagle's orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an \\"uncertain location\\" on the lunar surface.[58] The location is uncertain because the Eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time. NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.\\r\\nOn July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented:\\r\\n...?The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly?... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people?... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, \\"Thank you very much.\\"\\r\\nAldrin added:\\r\\nThis has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown?... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. \\"When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?\\"\\r\\nArmstrong concluded:\\r\\nThe responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.[18]\\r\\nOn the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.[59]\\r\\nOn July 24, the astronauts returned home aboard the Command Module Columbia just before dawn local time (16:51 UTC[4]) at 1319N 1699W? / ?13.317N 169.150W? / 13.317; -169.150? (Apollo 11 splashdown), in the Pacific Ocean 2,660?km (1,440?nmi) east of Wake Island, 380?km (210?nmi) south of Johnston Atoll, and 24?km (13?nmi) from the recovery ship, USS?Hornet.[1] This is near the village of Vatia in American Samoa.[60] The American Samoa-flag which was brought to the moon by Apollo 11 is on display at the Jean P. Haydon Museum in Pago Pago, the territorial capital of American Samoa.[61]\\r\\nAt 16:44 UTC the drogue parachutes had been deployed and seven minutes later the Command Module struck the water forcefully. During splashdown, the Command Module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts. \\"Everything's okay. Our checklist is complete. Awaiting swimmers\\", was Armstrong's last official transmission from Columbia. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the Command Module to prevent it from drifting. Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction. Though the chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site. Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the Hornet. Additionally, astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and the Command Module wiped with Betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.[62]\\r\\nA second Sea King helicopter - \\"Helicopter 66\\" - hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one, where a NASA flight surgeon gave each a brief physical check during the 0.5 nautical miles (930?m) trip back to the Hornet.\\r\\nAfter touchdown on the Hornet, the astronauts exited the helicopter, leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen. The helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay #2 where the astronauts walked the 30 feet (9.1?m) to the Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF) where they would begin the earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine.[63] This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped.[62][64]\\r\\nPresident Richard Nixon was aboard Hornet to personally welcome the astronauts back to Earth. He told the astronauts, \\"As a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before.\\"[65] After Nixon departed, the Hornet was brought alongside the five-ton Command Module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. The Hornet sailed for Pearl Harbor where Columbia and the MQF were airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center.[62]\\r\\nIn accordance with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16[66] to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health.[67] On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki[68]), and on Columbia itself.[69] Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.[69]\\r\\nOn August 13, they rode in parades in their honor in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.[70][71] On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official State Dinner to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel.[71] President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[71] This celebration was the beginning of a 45-day \\"Giant Leap\\" tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Many nations honored the first manned Moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.[72][73]\\r\\nOn September 16, 1969, the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them.\\r\\nThe Soviet Union had been competing with the US in landing a man on the Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V.[74] Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.[75]\\r\\nThe Command Module Columbia was displayed at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), Washington, D.C. It was in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, the Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7, and Gemini 4. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's Apollo to the Moon exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.\\r\\nIn March 2012 a team of specialists financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines that launched Apollo 11 into space. The engines were found below the Atlantic Ocean's surface through the use of advanced sonar scanning.[76] His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from the Apollo 11 launch.[77][78]\\r\\nColumbia was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA, to be readied for a four-city tour titled Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. This will include Space Center Houston (October 14, 2017, to March 18, 2018), the Saint Louis Science Center (April 14 to September 3, 2018), the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh (September 29, 2018, to February 18, 2019), and the Seattle Museum of Flight (March 16 to September 2, 2019).[79][80]\\r\\nOn July 15, 2009, Life.com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by Life photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch.[81]\\r\\nFrom July 16ÿ24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred.[82] In addition, it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments.[83]\\r\\nOn July 20, 2009, the crew of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.[84] \\"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin\\", Obama said. \\"We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\\"[85]\\r\\nThe John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum set up a Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.[86]\\r\\nA group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\\r\\nIt was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken?... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today?... The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date?... nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts ÿ Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.[87]\\r\\nOn August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Sen. Bill Nelson and Florida Rep. Alan Grayson.[88][89]\\r\\nIn July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronised and released for the first time.[90]\\r\\nSpectators camp out to watch the launch\\r\\nSeating credential issued to viewers of the Apollo 11 launch\\r\\nLaunch Control Center before liftoff\\r\\nCollins, Aldrin and Armstrong consult with pad leader Guenter Wendt after Countdown Demonstration Test\\r\\nRoll-out of Saturn V AS-505 from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad\\r\\nThe Earth as seen from Apollo 11 on the third day out\\r\\nNeil Armstrong describes the Moon's surface before setting foot on it\\r\\nPresident Nixon speaks to Armstrong and Aldrin from the Oval Office\\r\\nThe Washington Post on Monday, July 21, 1969: \\"'The Eagle Has Landed'Two Men Walk on the Moon\\"\\r\\nNeil Armstrong's certification: \\"I certify that this World Scout Badge was carried to the surface of the Moon on man's first lunar landing, Apollo XI, July 20, 1969.\\"\\r\\nFirst Man on the Moon Commemorative Issue of 1969\\r\\nApollo 11 crew at the White House in 2004\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\\r\\nFor young readers\\r\\nNASA reports\\r\\nMultimedia","input":"When did the first man set foot on the moon?"},{"output":"Brent Stephen Smith","context":"Brent Stephen Smith[5] (born January 10, 1978),[6] is an American singer, songwriter, and musician best known as the lead vocalist of the band Shinedown.[7][6][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrent Smith was born in Knoxville, Tennessee[5][6] and is an only child.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith was in a relationship with Teresa Collier until February of 2016. They had one son together, Lyric Santana Smith. Smith struggled with drugs, alcohol, and his weight. Smith eventually lost weight through exercise and a healthier diet. Smith says that both his girlfriend and son inspired him to lose weight.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to fronting the rock band Shinedown, Smith had a high school band named Blind Thoughts and later was the lead singer in a band called Dreve, which Atlantic Records had signed. Atlantic Records forced Brent to either find another band or lose his record deal. He made Shinedown shortly after. He then went to Los Angeles, California to record with well-known producer Desmond Child. Shortly after returning home to Knoxville, Tennessee, Atlantic dropped the band but retained Smith. He was soon given a developmental contract by Atlantic Records. Smith moved to Jacksonville, Florida and began working on the project in 2001.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first member he recruited was bassist Brad Stewart, through local Jacksonville music producer Pete Thornton.[12] Smith and Stewart began recording demos together in a small local studio, whose owner recommended they meet with her fianc, guitarist Jasin Todd, who Smith brought in as the third member.[12] The original lineup was rounded out by drummer Barry Kerch, who was the seventh drummer the band had auditioned for the spot.[12] The four worked together on creating demos, and submitted their work-in-progress material to Atlantic, who approved of the material and green-lighted a full-length album.[12][13][14] The band's debut album, Leave a Whisper was released May 27, 2003.[15] The album was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States, indicating sales of over one million.[16] Shinedown has since released four more studio albums, Us and Them (2005), The Sound of Madness (2008), Amaryllis (2012) and Threat to Survival (2015).

Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the century to 1770, and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world. This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales, from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801, though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as population more than tripled to over 32 million.[1] The rise in productivity accelerated the decline of the agricultural share of the labour force, adding to the urban workforce on which industrialization depended: the Agricultural Revolution has therefore been cited as a cause of the Industrial Revolution.\\r\\nHowever, historians continue to dispute when exactly such a \\"revolution\\" took place and of what it consisted. Rather than a single event, G.E. Mingay states that there were a \\"profusion of agricultural revolutions, one for two centuries before 1750, another emphasising the century after 1650, a third for the period 1750-1880, and a fourth for the middle decades of the nineteenth century\\".[2] This has led more recent historians to argue that any general statements about \\"the Agricultural Revolution\\" are difficult to sustain.[3][4]\\r\\nOne important change in farming methods was the move in crop rotation to turnips and clover in place of fallow. Turnips can be grown in winter and are deep-rooted, allowing them to gather minerals unavailable to shallow-rooted crops. Clover fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form of fertiliser. This permitted the intensive arable cultivation of light soils on enclosed farms and provided fodder to support increased livestock numbers whose manure added further to soil fertility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Agricultural Revolution was the result of the complex interaction of social, economic and farming technology changes. Major developments and innovations include:[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nYields have had the seed used to plant the crop\\r\\nsubtracted to give net yields.\\r\\nAverage seed sown is estimated at wheat 2.5 bu/acre;\\r\\nRye 2.5 bu/acre; Barley 3.5ÿ4.30 bu/acre; Oats\\r\\n2.5ÿ4.0 bu/acre; Peas & beans 2.50ÿ3.0 bu/acre.\\r\\n$ Average annual growth rate of agricultural output is\\r\\nper agricultural worker.\\r\\nOther authors offer different estimates.\\r\\nOne of the most important innovations of the British Agricultural Revolution was the development of the Norfolk four-course rotation, which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow.[5]\\r\\nCrop rotation is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons to help restore plant nutrients and mitigate the build-up of pathogens and pests that often occurs when one plant species is continuously cropped. Rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Turnip roots, for example, can recover nutrients from deep under the soil. The Norfolk System, as it is now known, rotates crops so that different crops are planted with the result that different kinds and quantities of nutrients are taken from the soil as the plants grow. An important feature of the Norfolk four-field system was that it used labour at times when demand was not at peak levels.[8]\\r\\nPlanting cover crops such as turnips and clover was not permitted under the common field system because they interfered with access to the fields. Besides, other people's livestock could graze the turnips.[9]\\r\\nDuring the Middle Ages, the open field system had initially used a two-field crop rotation system where one field was left fallow or turned into pasture for a time to try to recover some of its plant nutrients. Later they employed a three-year, three field crop rotation routine, with a different crop in each of two fields, e.g. oats, rye, wheat, and barley with the second field growing a legume like peas or beans, and the third field fallow. Normally from 10ÿ30% of the arable land in a three crop rotation system is fallow. Each field was rotated into a different crop nearly every year. Over the following two centuries, the regular planting of legumes such as peas and beans in the fields that were previously fallow slowly restored the fertility of some croplands. The planting of legumes helped to increase plant growth in the empty field due to the bacteria on legume roots' ability to fix nitrogen (N2) from the air into the soil in a form that plants could use. Other crops that were occasionally grown were flax and members of the mustard family.\\r\\nConvertible husbandry was the alternation of a field between pasture and grain. Because nitrogen builds up slowly over time in pasture, ploughing up pasture and planting grains resulted in high yields for a few years. A big disadvantage of convertible husbandry was the hard work in breaking up pastures and difficulty in establishing them. The significance of convertible husbandry is that it introduced pasture into the rotation.[10]\\r\\nThe farmers in Flanders (in parts of France and current day Belgium) discovered a still more effective four-field crop rotation system, using turnips and clover (a legume) as forage crops to replace the three-year crop rotation fallow year.\\r\\nThe four-field rotation system allowed farmers to restore soil fertility and restore some of the plant nutrients removed with the crops. Turnips first show up in the probate records in England as early as 1638 but were not widely used till about 1750. Fallow land was about 20% of the arable area in England in 1700 before turnips and clover were extensively grown. Guano and nitrates from South America were introduced in the mid-19th century and fallow steadily declined to reach only about 4% in 1900.[11] Ideally, wheat, barley, turnips and clover would be planted in that order in each field in successive years. The turnips helped keep the weeds down and were an excellent forage cropruminant animals could eat their tops and roots through a large part of the summer and winters. There was no need to let the soil lie fallow as clover would re-add nitrates (nitrogen-containing salts) back to the soil. The clover made excellent pasture and hay fields as well as green manure when it was ploughed under after one or two years. The addition of clover and turnips allowed more animals to be kept through the winter, which in turn produced more milk, cheese, meat and manure, which maintained soil fertility. This maintains a good amount of crops produced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mix of crops also changed: the area under wheat rose by 1870 to 3.5 million acres (1.4m ha), barley to 2.25m acres (0.9m ha) and oats less dramatically to 2.75m acres (1.1m ha), while rye dwindled to 60,000 acres (25,000 ha), less than a tenth of its late medieval peak. Grain yields benefited from new and better seed alongside improved rotation and fertility: wheat yields increased by a quarter in the 18th century[12] and nearly half in the 19th, averaging 30 bushels per acre (2,080?kg/ha) by the 1890s.\\r\\nThe Dutch acquired the iron-tipped, curved mouldboard, adjustable depth plough from the Chinese in the early 17th century. It had the advantage of being able to be pulled by one or two oxen compared to the six or eight needed by the heavy wheeled northern European plough. The Dutch plough was brought to Britain by Dutch contractors who were hired to drain East Anglian fens and Somerset moors. The plough was extremely successful on wet, boggy soil, but was soon used on ordinary land.[13][14]\\r\\nBritish improvements included Joseph Foljambe's cast iron plough (patented 1730), which combined an earlier Dutch design with a number of innovations. Its fittings and coulter were made of iron and the mouldboard and share were covered with an iron plate, making it easier to pull and more controllable than previous ploughs. By the 1760s Foljambe was making large numbers of these ploughs in a factory outside of Rotherham, England, using standard patterns with interchangeable parts. The plough was easy for a blacksmith to make, but by the end of the 18th century it was being made in rural foundries.[14][15][16] By 1770 it was the cheapest and best plough available. It spread to Scotland, America, and France.[14]\\r\\nIn Europe, agriculture was feudal from the Middle Ages. In the traditional open field system, many subsistence farmers cropped strips of land in large fields held in common and divided the produce. They typically worked under the auspices of the aristocracy or the Catholic Church, who owned much of the land.\\r\\nAs early as the 12th century, some fields in England tilled under the open field system were enclosed into individually owned fields. The Black Death from 1348 onward accelerated the break-up of the feudal system in England.[17] Many farms were bought by yeomen who enclosed their property and improved their use of the land. More secure control of the land allowed the owners to make innovations that improved their yields. Other husbandmen rented property they \\"share cropped\\" with the land owners. Many of these enclosures were accomplished by acts of Parliament in the 16th and 17th centuries.\\r\\nThe process of enclosing property accelerated in the 15th and 16th centuries. The more productive enclosed farms meant that fewer farmers were needed to work the same land, leaving many villagers without land and grazing rights. Many of them moved to the cities in search of work in the emerging factories of the Industrial Revolution. Others settled in the English colonies. English Poor Laws were enacted to help these newly poor.\\r\\nSome practices of enclosure were denounced by the Church, and legislation was drawn up against it; but the large, enclosed fields were needed for the gains in agricultural productivity from the 16th to 18th centuries. This controversy led to a series of government acts, culminating in the General Enclosure Act of 1801 which sanctioned large-scale land reform.\\r\\nThe process of enclosure was largely complete by the end of the 18th century.\\r\\nMarkets were widespread by 1500 with about 800 locations in Britain. These were regulated and not free. The most important development between the 16th century and the mid-19th century was the development of private marketing. By the 19th century, marketing was nationwide and the vast majority of agricultural production was for market rather than for the farmer and his family. The 16th-century market radius was about 10 miles, which could support a town of 10,000.[18]\\r\\nThe next stage of development was trading between markets, requiring merchants, credit and forward sales, knowledge of markets and pricing and of supply and demand in different markets. Eventually, the market evolved into a national one driven by London and other growing cities. By 1700, there was a national market for wheat.\\r\\nLegislation regulating middlemen required registration, addressed weights and measures, fixing of prices and collection of tolls by the government. Market regulations were eased in 1663 when people were allowed some self-regulation to hold inventory, but it was forbidden to withhold commodities from the market in an effort to increase prices. In the late 18th century, the idea of self-regulation was gaining acceptance.[19]\\r\\nThe lack of internal tariffs, customs barriers and feudal tolls made Britain \\"the largest coherent market in Europe\\".[20]\\r\\nHigh wagon transportation costs made it uneconomical to ship commodities very far outside the market radius by road, generally limiting shipment to less than 20 or 30 miles to market or to a navigable waterway. Water transport was, and in some cases still is, much more efficient than land transport. In the early 19th century it cost as much to transport a ton of freight 32 miles by wagon over an unimproved road as it did to ship it 3000 miles across the Atlantic.[21] A horse could pull at most one ton of freight on a Macadam road, which was multi-layer stone covered and crowned, with side drainage. But a single horse could pull a barge weighing over 30 tons.\\r\\nCommerce was aided by the expansion of roads and inland waterways. Road transport capacity grew from threefold to fourfold from 1500 to 1700.[22][23]\\r\\nRailroads would eventually reduce the cost of land transport by over 95%; however they did not become important until after 1850.\\r\\nAnother way to get more land was to convert some pasture land into arable land and recover fen land and some pastures. It is estimated that the amount of arable land in Britain grew by 10ÿ30% through these land conversions.\\r\\nThe British Agricultural Revolution was aided by land maintenance advancements in Flanders and the Netherlands. Due to the large and dense population of Flanders and Holland, farmers there were forced to take maximum advantage of every bit of usable land; the country had become a pioneer in canal building, soil restoration and maintenance, soil drainage, and land reclamation technology. Dutch experts like Cornelius Vermuyden brought some of this technology to Britain.\\r\\nWater-meadows were utilised in the late 16th to the 20th centuries and allowed earlier pasturing of livestock after they were wintered on hay. This increased livestock yields, giving more hides, meat, milk, and manure as well as better hay crops.\\r\\nWith the development of regional markets and eventually a national market, aided by improved transportation infrastructures, farmers were no longer dependent on their local market and were less subject to having to sell at low prices into an oversupplied local market and not being able to sell their surpluses to distant localities that were experiencing shortages. They also became less subject to price fixing regulations. Farming became a business rather than solely a means of subsistence.[24]\\r\\nUnder free market capitalism, farmers had to remain competitive. To be successful, farmers had to become effective managers who incorporated the latest farming innovations in order to be low cost producers.\\r\\nIn England, Robert Bakewell and Thomas Coke introduced selective breeding as a scientific practice, mating together two animals with particularly desirable characteristics, and also using inbreeding or the mating of close relatives, such as father and daughter, or brother and sister, to stabilise certain qualities in order to reduce genetic diversity in desirable animals programmes from the mid-18th century. Arguably, Bakewell's most important breeding programme was with sheep. Using native stock, he was able to quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The Lincoln Longwool was improved by Bakewell, and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the New (or Dishley) Leicester. It was hornless and had a square, meaty body with straight top lines.[25] Bakewell was also the first to breed cattle to be used primarily for beef. Previously, cattle were first and foremost kept for pulling ploughs as oxen or for dairy uses, with beef from surplus males as an additional bonus, but he crossed long-horned heifers and a Westmoreland bull to eventually create the Dishley Longhorn. As more and more farmers followed his lead, farm animals increased dramatically in size and quality. The average weight of a bull sold for slaughter at Smithfield was reported around 1700 as 370 pounds (170?kg), though this is considered a low estimate: by 1786, weights of 840 pounds (380?kg) were reported,[26][27] though other contemporary indicators suggest an increase of around a quarter over the intervening century.\\r\\nNew fertilisers, besides the organic fertilisers in manure, were slowly found as massive sodium nitrate (NaNO3) deposits found in the Atacama Desert, Chile, were brought under British financiers like John Thomas North and imports were started. Chile was happy to allow the exports of these sodium nitrates by allowing the British to use their capital to develop the mining and imposing a hefty export tax to enrich their treasury. Massive deposits of sea bird guano (11ÿ16% N, 8ÿ12% phosphate, and 2ÿ3% potash), were found and started to be imported after about 1830. Significant imports of potash obtained from the ashes of trees burned in opening new agricultural lands were imported. By-products of the British meat industry like bones from the knackers' yards were ground up or crushed and sold as fertiliser. By about 1840 about 30,000 tons of bones were being processed (worth about S150,000). An unusual alternative to bones was found to be the millions of tons of fossils called coprolites found in South East England. When these were dissolved in sulphuric acid they yielded a high phosphate mixture (called \\"super phosphate\\") that plants could absorb readily and increased crop yields. Mining coprolite and processing it for fertiliser soon developed into a major industrythe first commercial fertiliser.[28] Higher yield per acre crops were also planted as potatoes went from about 300,000 acres in 1800 to about 400,000 acres in 1850 with a further increase to about 500,000 in 1900.[29] Labour productivity slowly increased at about 0.6% per year. With more capital invested, more organic and inorganic fertilisers, and better crop yields increased the food grown at about 0.5%/yearnot enough to keep up with population growth.\\r\\nGreat Britain contained about 10.8 million people in 1801, 20.7 million in 1851 and 37.1 million by 1901. This corresponds to an annual population growth rate of 1.3% in 1801-1851 and 1.2% in 1851-1901, twice the rate of agricultural output growth.[30] In addition to land for cultivation there was also a demand for pasture land to support more livestock. The growth of arable acreage slowed from the 1830s and went into reverse from the 1870s in the face of cheaper grain imports, and wheat acreage nearly halved from 1870 to 1900.[31]\\r\\nThe recovery of food imports after the Napoleonic Wars (1803ÿ1815) and the resumption of American trade following the War of 1812 (1812ÿ1815) led to the enactment in 1815 of the Corn Laws (protective tariffs) to protect cereal grain producers in Britain against foreign competition. These laws were only removed in 1846 after the onset of the Irish Potato Famine in which potato late blight [32] ruined most of the Irish potato crop and brought famine to the Irish people in 1846ÿ50. Though the blight also struck Scotland, Wales, England, and much of Europe, its effect there was far less severe since potatoes constituted a much smaller percentage of the diet than in Ireland. In addition many Britons could afford to buy specially-imported food from other countries  the famine-stricken Irish were too poor to do this. Hundreds of thousands died in the Irish famine and millions more emigrated to England, Wales, Scotland, Canada, Australia, Europe, and the United States, reducing the population from about 8.5 million in 1845 to 4.3 million by 1921.\\r\\nBetween 1873 and 1879 British agriculture suffered from wet summers that damaged grain crops. Cattle farmers were hit by foot-and-mouth disease, and sheep farmers by sheep liver rot. The poor harvests, however, masked a greater threat to British agriculture: growing imports of foodstuffs from abroad. The development of the steam ship and the development of extensive railway networks in Britain and the USA allowed US farmers with much larger and more productive farms to export hard grain to Britain at a price that undercut the British farmers. At the same time, large amounts of cheap corned beef started to arrive from Argentina, and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the development of refrigerator ships (reefers) in about 1880 opened the British market to cheap meat and wool from Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina. The Long Depression was a worldwide economic recession that began in 1873 and ended around 1896. It hit the agricultural sector hard and was the most severe in Europe and the United States, which had been experiencing strong economic growth fuelled by the Second Industrial Revolution in the decade following the American Civil War. By 1900 half the meat eaten in Britain came from abroad and tropical fruits such as bananas were also being imported on the new refrigerator ships.\\r\\nBefore the introduction of the seed drill, the common practice was to plant seeds by broadcasting (evenly throwing) them across the ground by hand on the prepared soil and then lightly harrowing the soil to cover the seed. Seeds left on top of the ground were eaten by birds, insects, and mice. There was no control over spacing and seeds were planted too close together and too far apart. Alternately seeds could be laboriously planted one by one using a hoe and/or a shovel. Cutting down on wasted seed was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five.\\r\\nThe seed drill was introduced from China to Italy in the mid-16th century where it was patented by the Venetian Senate.[33] Jethro Tull invented an improved seed drill in 1701. It was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and at the correct depth. Tull's seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an impact. Good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid-18th century.\\r\\nThe Agricultural Revolution was part of a long process of improvement, but sound advice on farming began to appear in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others,[34] and the overall agricultural productivity of Britain started to grow significantly only in the period of the Agricultural Revolution. It is estimated that total agricultural output grew 2.7-fold between 1700 and 1870 and output per worker at a similar rate.\\r\\nDespite its name, the Agricultural Revolution in Britain did not result in overall productivity per hectare of agricultural area as high as in China, where intensive cultivation (including multiple annual cropping in many areas) had been practised for many centuries.[35][36]\\r\\nThe Agricultural Revolution in Britain proved to be a major turning point in history, allowing population to far exceed earlier peaks and sustain the country's rise to industrial pre-eminence. Towards the end of the 19th century, the substantial gains in British agricultural productivity were rapidly offset by competition from cheaper imports, made possible by the exploitation of new lands and advances in transportation, refrigeration, and other technologies.","input":"When did the agricultural revolution occur in britain?"},{"output":"July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC","context":"\\r\\nApollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two humans on the Moon. Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin, both American, landed the lunar module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 pounds (21.5?kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rejoining Columbia in lunar orbit.\\r\\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 9:32 am EDT (13:32 UTC) and was the fifth manned mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages ÿ a lower stage for landing on the Moon, and an upper stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.\\r\\nAfter being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagle's upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.\\r\\nThe landing was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as \\"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by U.S. President John F. Kennedy: \\"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApollo 11 was the second all-veteran multi-person crew (the first being Apollo 10) in human spaceflight history.[8] A previous solo veteran flight had been made on Soyuz 1 in 1967 by Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov.[9]\\r\\nCollins was originally slated to be the Command Module Pilot (CMP) on Apollo 8 but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by Jim Lovell, his backup for that flight. After Collins was medically cleared, he took what would have been Lovell's spot on Apollo 11; as a veteran of Apollo 8, Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11's backup crew and promoted to backup commander.\\r\\nIn early 1969, Anders accepted a job with the National Space Council effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date. At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch (at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed) and would later join Lovell's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original Apollo 13 CMP.[10]\\r\\nAfter the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to Manned Spacecraft Center director George M. Low to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. During early mission planning, the names Snowcone and Haystack were used and put in the news release,[11] but the crew later decided to change them.\\r\\nThe Command Module was named Columbia after the Columbiad, the giant cannon shell \\"spacecraft\\" fired by a giant cannon (also from Florida) in Jules Verne's 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon.[12] The Lunar Module was named Eagle for the national bird of the United States, the bald eagle, which is featured prominently on the mission insignia.\\r\\nThe Apollo 11 mission insignia was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for \\"peaceful lunar landing by the United States\\". He chose an eagle as the symbol, put an olive branch in its beak, and drew a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. NASA officials said the talons of the eagle looked too \\"warlike\\" and after some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the claws. The crew decided the Roman numeral XI would not be understood in some nations and went with \\"Apollo 11\\"; they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would \\"be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing\\".[13] All colors are natural, with blue and gold borders around the patch.\\r\\nWhen the Eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.[14] The design was also used for the smaller Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979, ten years after the Apollo 11 mission.[15]\\r\\nNeil Armstrong's personal preference kit carried a piece of wood from the Wright brothers' 1903 airplane's left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing,[16] along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given to Deke Slayton by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on Apollo 1 and given to Slayton after the mission but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton and Armstrong took it on Apollo 11.[17]\\r\\nIn addition to many people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information Jack King providing commentary. President Richard M. Nixon viewed the proceedings from the Oval Office of the White House.\\r\\nA Saturn V launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00?a.m. EDT local time). It entered Earth orbit, at an altitude of 100.4 nautical miles (185.9?km) by 98.9 nautical miles (183.2?km), twelve minutes later.[1] After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed: this involved separating the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) from the spent rocket stage, turning around, and docking with the Lunar Module still attached to the stage. After the Lunar Module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into orbit around the Sun.[4]\\r\\nOn July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. In the thirty orbits[18] that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) about 12 miles (19?km) southwest of the crater Sabine D (0.67408N, 23.47297E). The landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers along with the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or extravehicular activity (EVA) challenges.[19]\\r\\nOn July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module Eagle separated from the Command Module Columbia. Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.\\r\\nAs the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface four seconds early and reported that they were \\"long\\"; they would land miles west of their target point.\\r\\nFive minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800?m) above the surface of the Moon, the LM navigation and guidance computer distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected \\"1202\\" and \\"1201\\" program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, computer engineer Jack Garman told guidance officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated \\"executive overflows\\", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.[20]\\r\\nDue to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing?... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones?... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.[21][a]\\r\\nWhen Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300-meter (980?ft) diameter crater (later determined to be West crater, named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse). Armstrong took semi-automatic control[26] and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.[5]\\r\\nApollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.[5]\\r\\nThroughout the descent, Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the LM. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67-inch (170?cm) probes hanging from Eagle's footpads had touched the surface, and he said: \\"Contact light!\\" Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong said \\"Shutdown.\\" Aldrin immediately said \\"Okay, engine stop. ACA ÿ out of detent.\\" Armstrong acknowledged \\"Out of detent. Auto\\" and Aldrin continued \\"Mode control ÿ both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm ÿ off. 413 is in.\\"\\r\\nCharles Duke, CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying \\"We copy you down, Eagle.\\"\\r\\nArmstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with \\"Engine arm is off\\", before responding to Duke with the words, \\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\\" Armstrong's unrehearsed[27] change of call sign from \\"Eagle\\" to \\"Tranquility Base\\" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful. Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: \\"Roger, Twan Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.\\"[5][28]\\r\\nTwo and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:\\r\\nThis is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.[29]\\r\\nHe then took communion privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair (who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church, and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, the Rev. Dean Woodruff. Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of Guideposts magazine and in his book Return to Earth. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.[30]\\r\\nThe schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period as they had been awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.\\r\\nThe astronauts planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP)[31] and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle's twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60 field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.[32][33]\\r\\nSeveral books indicate early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin rather than Neil Armstrong as the first man on the Moon.[34]\\r\\nAt 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle's side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface.[35][36] The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture.[37] The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia.[38] Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth.[39] Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.\\r\\nWhile still on the ladder, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM Descent Stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:\\r\\nHere men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\\r\\nAfter describing the surface dust as \\"very fine-grained\\" and \\"almost like a powder,\\"[36] six and a half hours after landing,[1] Armstrong stepped off Eagle's footpad and declared, \\"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\\"[b][40][41][42][43]\\r\\nArmstrong intended to say \\"That's one small step for a man\\", but the word \\"a\\" is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said \\"for a man\\", and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the \\"a\\" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words \\"for a\\" together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the \\"a\\" may have been spoken but obscured by static.[44][45]\\r\\nAbout seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.[46]\\r\\nTwelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected,[1] Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface, and described the view with the simple phrase, \\"Magnificent desolation.\\"[36]\\r\\nIn addition to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s,[47] Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod 68 feet (21?m) from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.\\r\\nArmstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity, one-sixth of Earth's, was \\"even perhaps easier than the simulations?... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around.\\"[36] Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backwards, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle's shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.[36]\\r\\nThe astronauts planted a specially designed U.S. flag on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Some time later, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called \\"the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.\\"[48] Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, to respect the lunar landing as Kennedy's legacy.[49] Armstrong thanked the President, and gave a brief reflection on the significance of the moment:\\r\\nNixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.\\r\\nArmstrong: Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States, but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and curiosity, and men with a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.\\r\\nThe MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.\\r\\nThey deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a Lunar Ranging Retroreflector (LRRR). Then Armstrong walked 196 feet (60?m) from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes ÿ the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes.\\r\\nThree new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.\\r\\nDuring this period, Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. However, as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.[50] In a 2010 interview, Armstrong, who had walked a maximum of 196 feet (60?m) from the LM, explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.[51]\\r\\nAldrin entered Eagle first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5?lb) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.[52]\\r\\nPresident Nixon's speech writer William Safire had prepared In Event of Moon Disaster for the President to read on television in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon.[53] The contingency plan originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster.[54][55] According to the plan, Mission Control would \\"close down communications\\" with the LM, and a clergyman would \\"commend their souls to the deepest of the deep\\" in a public ritual likened to burial at sea. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke's First World War poem, \\"The Soldier\\".[55] The plan included presidential telephone calls to the astronauts' wives.\\r\\nWhile moving within the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.[52] Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.[56]\\r\\nAfter about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle's ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.\\r\\nAfter more than 21? total hours on the lunar surface, they had left behind scientific instruments that included a retroreflector array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.[57] (In his 1989 book, Men from Earth, Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book Moonshot, Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.\\r\\nFilm taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some 25 feet (8?m) from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple:[1] \\"The ascent stage of the LM separated?... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over.\\"[18] Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least 100 feet (30?m) from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.\\r\\nAfter rendezvous with Columbia, Eagle's ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on July 21, 1969, at 23:41 UTC. Just before the Apollo 12 flight, it was noted that Eagle was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that Eagle's orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an \\"uncertain location\\" on the lunar surface.[58] The location is uncertain because the Eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time. NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.\\r\\nOn July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented:\\r\\n...?The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly?... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people?... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, \\"Thank you very much.\\"\\r\\nAldrin added:\\r\\nThis has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown?... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. \\"When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?\\"\\r\\nArmstrong concluded:\\r\\nThe responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.[18]\\r\\nOn the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.[59]\\r\\nOn July 24, the astronauts returned home aboard the Command Module Columbia just before dawn local time (16:51 UTC[4]) at 1319N 1699W? / ?13.317N 169.150W? / 13.317; -169.150? (Apollo 11 splashdown), in the Pacific Ocean 2,660?km (1,440?nmi) east of Wake Island, 380?km (210?nmi) south of Johnston Atoll, and 24?km (13?nmi) from the recovery ship, USS?Hornet.[1] This is near the village of Vatia in American Samoa.[60] A copy of the American Samoa-flag, which was brought to the moon by Apollo 11, is on display at the Jean P. Haydon Museum in Pago Pago, the territorial capital of American Samoa.[61]\\r\\nAt 16:44 UTC the drogue parachutes had been deployed and seven minutes later the Command Module struck the water forcefully. During splashdown, the Command Module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts. \\"Everything's okay. Our checklist is complete. Awaiting swimmers\\", was Armstrong's last official transmission from Columbia. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the Command Module to prevent it from drifting. Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction. Though the chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site. Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the Hornet. Additionally, astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and the Command Module wiped with Betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.[62]\\r\\nA second Sea King helicopter hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one, where a NASA flight surgeon gave each a brief physical check during the 0.5 nautical miles (930?m) trip back to the Hornet.\\r\\nAfter touchdown on the Hornet, the astronauts exited the helicopter, leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen. The helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay #2 where the astronauts walked the 30 feet (9.1?m) to the Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF) where they would begin the earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine.[63] This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped.[62][64]\\r\\nPresident Richard Nixon was aboard Hornet to personally welcome the astronauts back to Earth. He told the astronauts, \\"As a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before.\\"[65] After Nixon departed, the Hornet was brought alongside the five-ton Command Module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. The Hornet sailed for Pearl Harbor where Columbia and the MQF were airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center.[62]\\r\\nIn accordance with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16[66] to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health.[67] On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki[68]), and on Columbia itself.[69] Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.[69]\\r\\nOn August 13, they rode in parades in their honor in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.[70][71] On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official State Dinner to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel.[71] President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[71] This celebration was the beginning of a 45-day \\"Giant Leap\\" tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Many nations honored the first manned Moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.[72][73]\\r\\nOn September 16, 1969, the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them.\\r\\nThe Soviet Union had been competing with the US in landing a man on the Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V.[74] Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.[75]\\r\\nThe Command Module Columbia was displayed at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), Washington, D.C. It was in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, the Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7, and Gemini 4. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's Apollo to the Moon exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.\\r\\nIn March 2012 a team of specialists financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines that launched Apollo 11 into space. The engines were found below the Atlantic Ocean's surface through the use of advanced sonar scanning.[76] His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from the Apollo 11 launch.[77][78]\\r\\nColumbia was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA, to be readied for a four-city tour titled Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. This will include Space Center Houston (October 14, 2017, to March 18, 2018), the Saint Louis Science Center (April 14 to September 3, 2018), the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh (September 29, 2018, to February 18, 2019), and the Seattle Museum of Flight (March 16 to September 2, 2019).[79][80]\\r\\nOn July 15, 2009, Life.com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by Life photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch.[81]\\r\\nFrom July 16ÿ24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred.[82] In addition, it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments.[83]\\r\\nOn July 20, 2009, the crew of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.[84] \\"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin\\", Obama said. \\"We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\\"[85]\\r\\nThe John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum set up a Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.[86]\\r\\nA group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\\r\\nIt was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken?... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today?... The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date?... nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts ÿ Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.[87]\\r\\nOn August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Sen. Bill Nelson and Florida Rep. Alan Grayson.[88][89]\\r\\nIn July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronised and released for the first time.[90]\\r\\nSpectators camp out to watch the launch\\r\\nSeating credential issued to viewers of the Apollo 11 launch\\r\\nLaunch Control Center before liftoff\\r\\nCollins, Aldrin and Armstrong consult with pad leader Guenter Wendt after Countdown Demonstration Test\\r\\nRoll-out of Saturn V AS-505 from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad\\r\\nThe Earth as seen from Apollo 11 on the third day out\\r\\nNeil Armstrong describes the Moon's surface before setting foot on it\\r\\nPresident Nixon speaks to Armstrong and Aldrin from the Oval Office\\r\\nThe Washington Post on Monday, July 21, 1969: \\"'The Eagle Has Landed'Two Men Walk on the Moon\\"\\r\\nNeil Armstrong's certification: \\"I certify that this World Scout Badge was carried to the surface of the Moon on man's first lunar landing, Apollo XI, July 20, 1969.\\"\\r\\nFirst Man on the Moon Commemorative Issue of 1969\\r\\nApollo 11 crew at the White House in 2004\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\\r\\nFor young readers\\r\\nNASA reports\\r\\nMultimedia","input":"When did a man walk on the moon?"},{"output":"throat hackles","context":"Corvus affinis Brehm, 1845\\r\\nCorvus marianae Mathews, 1911\\r\\nCorvus difficilis Stresemann, 1943\\r\\nCorvus australis Gmelin, 1788\\r\\nCorone australis (Gmelin)\\r\\nThe Australian raven (Corvus coronoides) is a passerine bird in the genus Corvus native to much of southern and northeastern Australia. Measuring 46ÿ53 centimetres (18ÿ21?in) in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and mouth, as well as strong grey-black legs and feet. The upperparts are glossy, with a purple, blue or green sheen, and its black feathers have grey bases. The Australian raven is distinguished from the Australian crow species by its throat hackles, which are prominent in adult birds. Older adult individuals have white irises, younger adults have a white irises with an inner blue rim, while younger birds have dark brown irises until fifteen months of age, and hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield described the Australian raven in 1827, its species name highlighting its similarity with the carrion crow (C. corone). Two subspecies are recognised, which differ slightly in calls and are quite divergent genetically.\\r\\nThe preferred habitat is open woodland and transitional zones. It has adapted well to urban environments and is a common city bird in Sydney, Canberra and Perth. An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, it eats a wide variety of plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas. In eastern Australia its range is strongly correlated with the presence of sheep, and it has been blamed for killing lambs. However, this is very rare, and the raven most often scavenges for afterbirth and stillborn animals as well as newborn lamb faeces. The Australian raven is territorial, with pairs generally bonding for life. Breeding takes place between July and September, with almost no variation across its range. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree, or occasionally in a man-made structure such as a windmill or other building.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian raven was first described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, when they reported George Caley's early notes on the species from the Sydney district.[2] Its specific epithet coronoides \\"crow-shaped\\" is derived from the Greek corone/? \\"crow\\" and eidos/?Ѵ? \\"shape\\" or \\"form\\".[3] The two naturalists regarded the Australian raven as very similar in appearance to the carrion crow (C. corone) of Europe,[4] though they noted it was larger with a longer bill. They did not give it a common name.[2] The location where the type specimen was collected is not recorded, but thought to be in the Parramatta district.[5] Christian Ludwig Brehm described Corvus affinis in 1845,[6] later determined to be this species.[7] In his 1865 Handbook to the Birds of Australia, John Gould recognised only one species of corvid in Australia, Corvus australis, which he called the white-eyed crow. He used Johann Friedrich Gmelin's 1788 name,[a] which predated Vigors and Horsfield's description.[10] In 1877 Richard Bowdler Sharpe recognised two species, but recorded that the feather bases of the type specimen of C. coronoides were white. He named C. coronoides as the \\"crow\\" and C. australis (as Corone australis) the \\"raven\\".[5] Scottish naturalist William Robert Ogilvie-Grant corrected this in 1912 after re-examining the type specimen, clarifying the species as C. coronoides (raven, and incorporating little and forest ravens) and C. cecilae (Torresian crow).[11]\\r\\nGregory Mathews described the western subspecies perplexus in 1912, naming it the southwestern crow and noting that it was smaller than the nominate subspecies. He called C. coronoides coronoides the eastern crow, listing its range as New South Wales, and described what is now the Australian crow as another subspecies, C. coronoides cecilae, calling it the north-western crow and recording its range as northwestern Australia. In the same work he listed the raven as Corvus marianae, with a type specimen from Gosford and listing its range as New South Wales. He listed the little raven and forest raven as subspecies.[12] Mathews had erected C. marianae in 1911 as the name after declaring Corvus australis Gould to be preoccupied;[13] French-American ornithologist Charles Vaurie acted as First Revisor under Article 24 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) Code and discarded C. australis as a junior homonymin 1788, Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the black nunbirdto preserve the stability of the name.[14] This has been followed by later authors.[15]\\r\\nGerman ornithologist Erwin Stresemann lumped all Australian corvids plus other species as far as India into a single species, C. coronoides, as he believed there was intergradation between all characteristics such as iris colour, colour of feather bases and plumage. This was hotly disputed by Mathews. The official RAOU checklist listed three species (Australian raven, Torresian crow and little crow), with the little raven recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest raven in 1970. Streseman described C. difficilis in 1943 from a single specimen, now thought to have been an unusual Australian raven or an Australian raven/Torresian crow hybrid.[5]\\r\\nAlternative names sometimes seen include southern raven, southern crow and Kelly,[4] the last thought to have alluded to the Kelly Gang, though did not appear until the 1920s. Southern crow was considered by the RAOU before Australian raven was adopted as the official name for the species in 1926.[16] The term \\"crow\\" is colloquially applied to any or all species of Australian corvid.[5] The Australian raven was called wugan by the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney Basin.[17]\\r\\nThe Australian raven's closest relatives are the other two species of raven occurring in Australia: the little raven and forest raven. The Australian raven is also somewhat closely related to the Torresian and little crow, although not as closely related as it is to the other raven species. Initial single gene genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another. The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the little raven may be nested within the Australian raven, though the authors conceded more genetic work was needed.[18] Subsequent multigene analysis using nuclear DNA by J?nsson and colleagues in 2012 showed the eastern and western subspecies of the Australian raven to form two clades, almost as genetically distinct as the forest and little raven are to each other. This led the authors to propose that the subspecies be recognised as separate species.[19]\\r\\nbismarck crow\\r\\ntorresian crow\\r\\nlittle crow\\r\\nlittle raven\\r\\nforest raven\\r\\nAustralian raven (eastern subspecies)\\r\\nAustralian raven (western subspecies)\\r\\nIan Rowley proposed that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north,[20] which molecular evidence indicates occurred in the early Pliocene epoch around 4 million years ago.[19] The raven diverged into the ancestor of the forest and little ravens in the east and Australian raven in the west,[20] this split occurring around 2 million years ago in the early Pleistocene.[19] As the climate became cooler and drier, the aridity of central Australia split them entirely. Furthermore, the eastern birds diverged into nomadic little ravens and, in forested refuges, forest ravens. As the climate eventually became warmer, the western birds spread eastwards and almost outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia. Rowley noted that the western subspecies of the Australian raven had features intermediate between the eastern subspecies of Australian and little ravens.[20]\\r\\nTwo subspecies are recognised:\\r\\nMeasuring 46ÿ53?cm (18ÿ21?in) in length with a 100?cm (39?in) wingspan and weighing around 650?g (1.43?lb),[4] the adult Australian raven is an all black-bird with a black beak, mouth and tongue and sturdy black or grey-black legs and feet.[23] The tibia is fully feathered and the tarsus is long, and the feet large and strong.[24] It has white irises.[23] The plumage is glossy with a blue-purple to blue-green sheen, greenish over the ear coverts, depending on light. The underparts are not glossy.[25] The Australian raven has throat feathers (hackles) that are lanceolate with rounded tips, while the other four species of Australian corvids have bifurcate tips, though this can be difficult to see in the field.[21] The hackles are also longer than those of the other four species; when they are raised (such as when the bird is calling), they give the bird an unusual bearded appearance. The upper third of the upper mandible, including the nares and nasal groove, is covered with bristles,[25] which can be up to 3?cm (1.2?in) long.[26] The heavy-set beak is tipped with a slight hook,[25] and is longer than the bird's head. The wings are long and broad, with the longest of its ten primary feathers (usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth) almost reaching the end of the tail when the bird is at rest. The tail is rounded or wedge-shaped.[24] The Australian raven can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers, which is white in the latter species. The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows. Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field, but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled.[21] Unlike the other four species, the Australian raven has a bare patch of skin under, and extending to beside, the bill. This can be hard to discern in the field. The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species, with the forest raven the stockiest of all.[27] Relative size of species is only useful when two species can be seen side by side, as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small.[28]\\r\\nJuveniles resemble adults, but lack throat hackles,[26] and sometimes have a pink fleshy gape.[29] The bill is shorter and shallower;[25] its base can be pinkish and the tip can be light grey.[23] The plumage is more ruffled and softer in appearance, lacks the glossy highlights and often having a brown tinge.[25] The bare skin on the throat is pink in bird that have recently left the nest.[23] Eye colour varies with age, gradually lightening from juvenile to adult.[25] Nestlings up to four months old have blue-grey irises, juveniles aged from four to fifteen months have dark brown irises, and immature birds have hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months.[5][b] Immature birds older than one year develop hackles,[24] while some pink remains in the gape until the bird is two or three years of age.[23]\\r\\nThe territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area.[30] When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture.[28] This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory.[31] The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so,[4] although the drawing-out of the final notelong held to be solely recorded for the Australian ravenhas been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.[28]\\r\\nThe volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There are a variety of contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the nest to its mate.[31]\\r\\nThe Australian raven is common throughout eastern Australia,[29] and southern Western Australia (the populations being connected by a narrow strip across the Nullarbor Plain), but it is rarer and more scattered in the north, with isolated sightings in Cape York at Coen, Windmill Creek and the Mitchell River,[32] and becoming more common south of Rockhampton in central Queensland. It is found throughout New South Wales, though is uncommon in the northeast of the state. It is rare in the Australian Alps, being replaced there by the little raven. It occurs across Victoria and eastern South Australia, through the Eyre Peninsula and Nullarbor Plain into Western Australia, across the state north to the Wooramel River.[33] It is found on some offshore islands such as Rottnest Island[34] and Kangaroo Island.[33] It is a rare vagrant to Lord Howe Island.[33]\\r\\nThe Australian raven can be found in a wide range of natural and modified habitats. It requires available water and trees (or buildings) to roost in or perch on. Preferred habitats include eucalypt-dominated sclerophyll forest, and farmland adjacent to trees. It is also found in heath and mangroves. In areas where it occurs with the little raven, namely over much of central New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia,[21] the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas.[35] Similarly, in inland Australia it can share range with the little crow, as the two do not appear to compete. However, the ranges of similar-sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other. In central and western regions, Australian ravens and Torresian crows vie for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops, and only one or the other are found there.[5] It co-occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from Port Stephens northwards.[21] The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common corvid in Canberra, Sydney and Perth; in Melbourne and Adelaide it is replaced by the little raven,[21] and by the Torresian crow in Brisbane.[36] Its large range, abundance and increasing population mean it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.[1]\\r\\nDifficulties in distinguishing Australian corvids has hampered understanding of seasonal movements. The Australian raven is thought to be largely sedentary, with most movement of over 16?km (9.9?mi) due to flocks of non-breeding subadult birds.[37] Juvenile birds leave their parents and join flocks when they are four or five months old. Smaller flocks of 8ÿ30 birds stay within an area of around 260 square kilometres, while larger flocks of up to 300?birds may travel hundreds of kilometres seeking food.[38]\\r\\nA single breeding pair and their brood can occupy a territory of up to around 120 hectares (300 acres) and remains there year-round, though groups of ravens may enter this area to forage.[37] Australian ravens will defend their territory by chasing, dive-bombing and occasionally striking the backs of birds of prey, foxes or even people.[39] They generally mate for life, though occasionally one male has been found to be mated with two females in adjacent territories.[31] If the female dies, the male Australian raven maintains the territory and finds another mate, while if the male bird is lost, the female abandons the territory.[40] No courtship behaviour has been observed, and species that mate for life often lack elaborate courting displays.[31] Once they begin breeding at three years of age, they live another four to five years on average. During this time they produce two surviving young each year on average.[40] The longest-lived Australian raven recorded is an adult (of at least 3 years of age) that was banded and recaptured alive 12 years and 5 months later.[38]\\r\\nAustralian ravens generally walk when moving around on the ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, particularly when roosting in the middle of the day. They also engage in allopreening, where birds will preen each other's head and neck. This takes place particularly in autumn, winter and spring, and is important in pair bonding.[31] Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, shuffling next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.[41]\\r\\nAustralian ravens begin breeding once they are three years old.[40] Breeding season is from July to September,[42] with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species with a wide range and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October.[43] Australian ravens generally nest in tall trees, never near to the ground as some species do.[32] The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected.[44] The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles,[32] or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the AWA Tower in Sydney.[44]\\r\\nNests are generally large and untidy, consisting of a bowl or platform of sticks lined with grasses, barks, and feathers that can be up to 5?cm (2.0?in) thick.[45] As they are relatively heavy, they are built on larger forks in trees rather than out in the canopy. Building the nest is often time-consuming initially as the birds try (and often fail) to wedge sticks, which are 30ÿ60?cm (12ÿ24?in) long and 0.6ÿ1.2?cm (1?4ÿ1?2?in) thick, into the tree fork to make a platform. Thinner sticks and rootlets are used to make the bowl before the bowl is lined with feathers. Both birds build the nest, with the female taking over the lining of the nest while the male brings her material. New nests are built each year generally, as the re-use of old ones might spread disease or parasitesnests become caked with faeces as the nestlings grow and the parents cannot keep up with its removal. Furthermore, old nests often disintegrate within twelve months due to their exposed locations.[44] The female develops a brood patcha patch of bare skin on the bird's underparts that reddens and becomes much more extensive from around three weeks before the first egg is laid. The skin itself is oedematous and wrinkled, and does not get re-feathered until December after the breeding season has finished.[43]\\r\\nTheir lofty locations makes monitoring of Australian raven nests difficult.[44] A clutch can comprise up to six eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with five being the most common number.[44] Measuring 45 by 30?mm (1?3?4 by 1?1?4?in), eggs are pale green or bluish-green and splotched with darker olive, brown and blackish markings.[42] Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified.[44] Incubation of the eggs is done solely by the female over roughly 20?days. Incubation is intermittent initially, becoming constant by the time the third or fourth egg is laid.[45] Only one brood is raised per year, though a second clutch may be laid if the first clutch is lost early in the season. Late clutches have poor survival rates, possibly due to chicks getting dehydrated on hot days as the year progresses or being eaten by wedge-tailed eagles.[43] The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless, naked and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period.[45] They have pink skin until 5?days of age, when feathers under the skin turn it grey. They lose their egg tooth at the same time.[44] Their eyes begin opening at 5 to 6 days of age and are fully open by 11 to 12 days, by which time their feathers begin emerging. At 14 days, their primary feathers begin emerging, and they are fully feathered by 35ÿ36 days old.[45] They leave the nest at 40ÿ45?days of age, and stay with the parents for three to four months after that. They follow their parents and beg for food for the first month outside the nest but are feeding themselves by the third month. Young birds are often attacked when they enter neighbouring territories, and melees ensue as their parents try to defend them and herd them back.[44]\\r\\nThe Australian raven is omnivorous, though eats more meat than smaller corvids. Its diet in summer contains a high proportion of insects, while more plant items are eaten in autumn. Flesh makes up over half its diet in winter. Invertebrates commonly eaten include spiders, millipedes, centipedes (which ravens behead before eating), grasshoppers, cicadas and caterpillars (especially of the family Noctuidae), which are important in feeding nestlings. Australian ravens sometimes eat yabbies (Cherax destructor) from the edges of dams. Unusually for a ground-feeding omnivore, earthworms are rarely eaten. Australian ravens have been reported killing birds of such size as young galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus) and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Most mammals are eaten as carrion, as many species are too large for the raven to kill, though young rabbits are a frequent prey item.[46] Australian ravens drink water frequently, up to ten times a day in hot weather. Birds have been observed dunking pieces of meat in water before eating them,[31] as well as doing the same with hard biscuits to make them soggy and soft.[47]\\r\\nAustralian ravens are intelligent birds, and like many other corvids have innovative methods of seeking out food.[19] Foraging takes place in the early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while flying overhead, or by walking along and looking.[31] However, they occasionally feed in treesAustralian ravens forage eucalypt foliage for Christmas beetles (Anoplognathus), and devote a substantial amount of time to look for nests and eggs to eat. They have also been known to take golf balls from fairways, possibly mistaking them for eggs.[46] Ravens use their bill rather than their feet to explore or turn items on the ground (rocks or sticks) over, or hold or snatch food while flying. They have also been recorded using fence posts as anvils to bash snails against before eating them. Australian ravens most often eat food where they find it unless taking food back for nestlings. Occasionally they have been observed caching carrion or a killed animal in a hole nearby to store it. They can pack shredded meat in their mouth under their tongue.[31] Australian ravens have adapted well to eating food scraps in urban areas, such as school playgrounds, rubbish tips, bins outside supermarkets or restaurants, abattoirs, piggeries and farmyards.[32] In one isolated study, they were observed feeding on nectar from eucalypt flowers.[48] Australian ravens sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with any of the other four species of Australian corvids. Sometimes they are aggressive with little ravens if both are at a food source and drive them off, though not if the smaller species greatly outnumbers the larger.[49]\\r\\nA circovirusgiven the name raven circovirus or RaCVwas isolated from an Australian raven suffering from feather lesions in 2006. It has affinities with canary circovirus (CaCV) and pigeon circovirus (PiCV). Its clinical significance is unknown.[50] Tick infestation is rare in the Australian raven, with Ixodes holocyclus and Amblyomma triguttatum recorded. Lice and hippoboscid flies have been recorded yet little-researched, and an infestation by the fly Passeromyia longicornis was recorded in one nest.[44]\\r\\nThe wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax) preys on adult, nestling, and fledgling Australian ravens, while the little eagle (Hieraaetus morphnoides) also takes nestlings, and powerful owl (Ninox strenua) has been recorded killing adults;[26] other birds of prey are seen as threats, yet there is no evidence they have successfully preyed on the ravens. The introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes) competes with the Australian raven for carrion and can drive it off. It may also kill young birds that it catches on the ground.[44] The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) has been recorded as a brood parasite.[26]\\r\\nAustralian ravens die most often by being shot or poisonedgenerally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by vehicles than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished in their first year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as they are more likely to come into conflict with farmers.[38] The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs.[51] Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked.[52] Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs.[47][c] Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21ÿ44% protein, 9ÿ37% fat and 10ÿ30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills.[52] Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops.[53] In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.[54]\\r\\nIn Australian Aboriginal mythology, Crow is a trickster, culture hero and ancestral being. In the Kulin nation in central Victoria he was known as Waa (also Wahn or Waang) and was regarded as one of two moiety ancestors, the other being the more sombre eaglehawk Bunjil. Legends relating to Crow have been observed in various Aboriginal language groups and cultures across Australia.[55]\\r\\nTo the Noongar people of southwestern Australia, the Australian raven was Waardar, \\"the Watcher\\" and was wily and unpredictable. Noongar people were socially divided into two moieties or kinships: waardarng-maat and marrnetj-maat, or members of the Australian raven and long-billed corella (Cacatua tenuirostris) respectively.[56]","input":"What is the difference between a raven and a crow in australia?"},{"output":"Christians","context":"Religion in the United States is characterized by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices. Various religious faiths have flourished within the United States. A majority of Americans report that religion plays a very important role in their lives, a proportion unique among developed countries.[1]\\r\\nHistorically, the United States has always been marked by religious pluralism and diversity, beginning with various native beliefs of the pre-colonial time. In colonial times, Anglicans, Catholics and mainline Protestants, as well as Jews, arrived from Europe. Eastern Orthodoxy has been present since the Russian colonization of Alaska. Various dissenting Protestants, who left the Church of England, greatly diversified the religious landscape. The Great Awakenings gave birth to multiple Evangelical Protestant denominations; membership in Methodist and Baptist churches increased drastically in the Second Great Awakening. In the 18th century, deism found support among American upper classes and thinkers. The Episcopal Church, splitting from the Church of England, came into being in the American Revolution. New Protestant branches like Adventism emerged; Restorationists and other Christians like the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Latter Day Saint movement, Churches of Christ and Church of Christ, Scientist, as well as Unitarian and Universalist communities all spread in the 19th century. Pentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century as a result of the Azusa Street Revival. Scientology emerged in the 1950s. Unitarian Universalism resulted from the merge of Unitarian and Universalist churches in the 20th century. Beginning in 1990s, the religious share of Christians is decreasing due to secularization, while Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and other religions are spreading. Protestantism, historically dominant, ceased to be the religious category of the majority in the early 2010s.\\r\\nThe majority of U.S. adults self-identify as Christians, while close to a quarter claim no religious affiliation.[2] According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 70.6% of the adult population identified themselves as Christians, with 46.5% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 20.8% professing Catholic beliefs. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam) collectively make up about 6% of the population. According to a 2012 survey by the Pew forum, 36% of U.S. adults state that they attend services nearly every week or more.[3] According to a 2016 Gallup poll, Mississippi (with 63% of its adult population described as very religious, saying that religion is important to them and attending religious services almost every week) is the most religious state in the country, while New Hampshire (with only 20% of its adult population described as very religious) is the least religious state.[4]\\r\\nFrom early colonial days, when some English and German settlers came in search of religious freedom, America has been profoundly influenced by religion.[5] That influence continues in American culture, social life, and politics.[6] Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion within a community of like-minded people: the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English Puritans (Congregationalists), Pennsylvania by British Quakers, Maryland by English Catholics, and Virginia by English Anglicans. Despite these, and as a result of intervening religious strife and preference in England[7] the Plantation Act 1740 would set official policy for new immigrants coming to British America until the American Revolution.\\r\\nThe text of the First Amendment to the country's Constitution states that \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\\" It guarantees the free exercise of religion while also preventing the government from establishing a state religion. However the states were not bound by the provision and as late as the 1830s Massachusetts provided tax money to local Congregational churches.[8] The Supreme Court since the 1940s has interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment as applying the First Amendment to the state and local governments.\\r\\nPresident John Adams and a unanimous Senate endorsed the Treaty of Tripoli in 1797 that stated: \\"the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.\\"[9]\\r\\nGoing forward from its foundation, the United States has been called a Protestant nation by a variety of sources.[10][11][12][13]\\r\\nAccording to a 2002 survey by the Pew Research Center, nearly 6 in 10 Americans said that religion plays an important role in their lives, compared to 33% in Great Britain, 27% in Italy, 21% in Germany, 12% in Japan, and 11% in France. The survey report stated that the results showed America having a greater similarity to developing nations (where higher percentages say that religion plays an important role) than to other wealthy nations, where religion plays a minor role.[1]\\r\\nIn 1963, 90% of U.S. adults claimed to be Christian while only 2% professed no religious identity.[14] In 2014, close to 70% identify as Christian while close to 23% claim no religious identity.[2]\\r\\nThe United States federal government was the first national government to have no official state-endorsed religion.[15] However, some states had established religions in some form until the 1830s.\\r\\nModeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, the framers of the Constitution rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise, thus protecting any religious organization, institution, or denomination from government interference. The decision was mainly influenced by European Rationalist and Protestant ideals, but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them.[16]\\r\\nThe most popular religion in the U.S. is Christianity, comprising the majority of the population (70.6% of adults in 2014).[2] According to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies newsletter published March 2017, based on data from 2010, Christians were the largest religious population in all 3,143 counties in the country.[17] Roughly 46.5% of Americans are Protestants, 20.8% are Catholics, 1.6% are Mormons (the name commonly used to refer to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), and 1.7% have affiliations with various other Christian denominations.[2] Christianity was introduced during the period of European colonization.\\r\\nAccording to a 2012 review by the National Council of Churches, the five largest denominations are:[18]\\r\\nThe Southern Baptist Convention, with over 16 million adherents, is the largest of more than 200[19] distinctly named Protestant denominations.[20] In 2007, members of evangelical churches comprised 26% of the American population, while another 18% belonged to mainline Protestant churches, and 7% belonged to historically black churches.[21]\\r\\nA 2015 study estimates some 450,000 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.[22] In 2010 there were approximately 180,000 Arab Americans and about 130,000 Iranian Americans who converted from Islam to Christianity. Dudley Woodbury, a Fulbright scholar of Islam, estimates that 20,000 Muslims convert to Christianity annually in the United States.[23]\\r\\nHistorians agree that members of mainline Protestant denominations have played leadership roles in many aspects of American life, including politics, business, science, the arts, and education. They founded most of the country's leading institutes of higher education.[24] According to Harriet Zuckerman, 72% of American Nobel Prize Laureates between 1901 and 1972, have identified from Protestant background.[25]\\r\\nEpiscopalians[26] and Presbyterians[27] tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated than most other religious groups, and numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts[26] and Astors,[26] Rockefeller,[28] Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Whitneys,[26] Morgans[26] and Harrimans are Mainline Protestant families,[26] though those affiliated with Judaism are the wealthiest religious group in the United States[29][30]and those affiliated with Catholicism, owing to sheer size, have the largest number of adherents of all groups in the top income bracket.[31]\\r\\nSome of the first colleges and universities in America, including Harvard,[32] Yale,[33] Princeton,[34] Columbia,[35] Dartmouth,[36] Williams, Bowdoin, Middlebury,[37] and Amherst, all were founded by mainline Protestant denominations. By the 1920s most had weakened or dropped their formal connection with a denomination. James Hunter argues that:\\r\\nBeginning around 1600 European settlers introduced Anglican and Puritans religion, as well as Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Quaker, and Moravian denominations.[39]\\r\\nBeginning in the 16th century, the Spanish (and later the French and English) introduced Catholicism. From the 19th century to the present, Catholics came to the US in large numbers due to immigration of Italians, Hispanics, Portuguese, French, Polish, Irish, Highland Scots, Dutch, Flemish, Hungarians, Germans, Lebanese (Maronite), and other ethnic groups.\\r\\nEastern Orthodoxy was brought to America by Greek, Ukrainian, Armenian, and other immigrant groups.[40][41]\\r\\nSeveral Christian groups were founded in America during the Great Awakenings. Interdenominational evangelicalism and Pentecostalism emerged; new Protestant denominations such as Adventism; non-denominational movements such as the Restoration Movement (which over time separated into the Churches of Christ, the Christian churches and churches of Christ, and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)); Jehovah's Witnesses (called \\"Bible Students\\" in the latter part of the 19th century); and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism).\\r\\nThe strength of various sects varies greatly in different regions of the country, with rural parts of the South having many evangelicals but very few Catholics (except Louisiana and the Gulf Coast, and from among the Hispanic community, both of which consist mainly of Catholics), while urbanized areas of the north Atlantic states and Great Lakes, as well as many industrial and mining towns, are heavily Catholic, though still quite mixed, especially due to the heavily Protestant African-American communities. In 1990, nearly 72% of the population of Utah was Mormon, as well as 26% of neighboring Idaho.[42] Lutheranism is most prominent in the Upper Midwest, with North Dakota having the highest percentage of Lutherans (35% according to a 2001 survey).[43]\\r\\nThe largest religion, Christianity, has proportionately diminished since 1990. While the absolute number of Christians rose from 1990 to 2008, the percentage of Christians dropped from 86% to 76%.[44] A nationwide telephone interview of 1,002 adults conducted by The Barna Group found that 70% of American adults believe that God is \\"the all-powerful, all-knowing creator of the universe who still rules it today\\", and that 9% of all American adults and 0.5% young adults hold to what the survey defined as a \\"biblical worldview\\".[45]\\r\\nEpiscopalian, Presbyterian, Eastern Orthodox and United Church of Christ members[46] have the highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita of all Christian denominations in the United States,[47][48] as well as the most high-income earners.[49][50]However, owing to the sheer size or demographic head count of Catholics, more individual Catholics have graduate degrees and are in the highest income brackets than have or are individuals of any other religious community.[51]\\r\\nAfter Christianity, Judaism is the next largest religious affiliation in the US, though this identification is not necessarily indicative of religious beliefs or practices.[44] There are between 5.3 and 6.6 million Jews. A significant number of people identify themselves as American Jews on ethnic and cultural grounds, rather than religious ones. For example, 19% of self-identified American Jews do not believe God exists.[52] The 2001 ARIS study projected from its sample that there are about 5.3?million adults in the American Jewish population: 2.83?million adults (1.4% of the U.S. adult population) are estimated to be adherents of Judaism; 1.08?million are estimated to be adherents of no religion; and 1.36?million are estimated to be adherents of a religion other than Judaism.[53] ARIS 2008 estimated about 2.68 million adults (1.2%) in the country identify Judaism as their faith.[44]\\r\\nJews have been present in what is now the US since the 17th century, and specifically allowed since the British colonial Plantation Act 1740. Although small Western European communities initially developed and grew, large-scale immigration did not take place until the late 19th century, largely as a result of persecutions in parts of Eastern Europe. The Jewish community in the United States is composed predominantly of Ashkenazi Jews whose ancestors emigrated from Central and Eastern Europe. There are, however, small numbers of older (and some recently arrived) communities of Sephardi Jews with roots tracing back to 15th century Iberia (Spain, Portugal, and North Africa). There are also Mizrahi Jews (from the Middle East, Caucasia and Central Asia), as well as much smaller numbers of Ethiopian Jews, Indian Jews, Kaifeng Jews and others from various smaller Jewish ethnic divisions. Approximately 25% of the Jewish American population lives in New York City.[54]\\r\\nAccording to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies newsletter published March, 2017, based on data from 2010, Jews were the largest minority religion in 231 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country.[17] According to a 2014 survey conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public life, 1.7% of adults in the U.S. identify Judaism as their religion. Among those surveyed, 44% said they were Reform Jews, 22% said they were Conservative Jews, and 14% said they were Orthodox Jews.[2][55] According to the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey, 38% of Jews were affiliated with the Reform tradition, 35% were Conservative, 6% were Orthodox, 1% were Reconstructionists, 10% linked themselves to some other tradition, and 10% said they are \\"just Jewish\\".[56]\\r\\nThe Pew Research Center report on American Judaism released in October 2013 revealed that 22% of Jewish Americans say they have \\"no religion\\" and the majority of respondents do not see religion as the primary constituent of Jewish identity. 62% believe Jewish identity is based primarily in ancestry and culture, only 15% in religion. Among Jews who gave Judaism as their religion, 55% based Jewish identity on ancestry and culture, and 66% did not view belief in God as essential to Judaism.[57]\\r\\nA 2009 study estimated the Jewish population (including both those who define themselves as Jewish by religion and those who define themselves as Jewish in cultural or ethnic terms) to be between 6.0 and 6.4 million.[58] According to a study done in 2000 there were an estimated 6.14 million Jewish people in the country, about 2% of the population.[59]\\r\\nAccording to the 2001 National Jewish Population Survey, 4.3?million American Jewish adults have some sort of strong connection to the Jewish community, whether religious or cultural.[60] Jewishness is generally considered an ethnic identity as well as a religious one. Among the 4.3?million American Jews described as \\"strongly connected\\" to Judaism, over 80% have some sort of active engagement with Judaism, ranging from attendance at daily prayer services on one end of the spectrum to attending Passover Seders or lighting Hanukkah candles on the other. The survey also discovered that Jews in the Northeast and Midwest are generally more observant than Jews in the South or West. Reflecting a trend also observed among other religious groups, Jews in the Northwestern United States are typically the least observant of tradition.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Jewish American community has higher household incomes than average, and is one of the best educated religious communities in the United States.[46]\\r\\nIslam is the third largest faith in the United States, after Christianity and Judaism, representing 0.9% of the population.[2][61] According to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies newsletter published March, 2017, based on data from 2010, Muslims were the largest minority religion in 392 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country.[17] Islam in America effectively began with the arrival of African slaves. It is estimated that about 10% of African slaves transported to the United States were Muslim.[62] Most, however, became Christians, and the United States did not have a significant Muslim population until the arrival of immigrants from Arab and East Asian Muslim areas.[63] According to some experts,[64] Islam later gained a higher profile through the Nation of Islam, a religious group that appealed to black Americans after the 1940s; its prominent converts included Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali.[65][66] The first Muslim elected in Congress was Keith Ellison in 2006,[67] followed by Andr Carson in 2008.[68]\\r\\nResearch indicates that Muslims in the United States are generally more assimilated and prosperous than their counterparts in Europe.[69][70][71] Like other subcultural and religious communities, the Islamic community has generated its own political organizations and charity organizations.\\r\\nThe United States has perhaps the second largest Bah' community in the world. First mention of the faith in the U.S. was at the inaugural Parliament of World Religions, which was held at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. In 1894, Ibrahim George Kheiralla, a Syrian Bah' immigrant, established a community in the U.S. He later left the main group and founded a rival movement.[72] According to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies newsletter published March, 2017, based on data from 2010, Bah's were the largest minority religion in 80 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country.[17]\\r\\nRastafarians began migrating to the United States in the 1950s, '60s and '70s from the religion's 1930s birthplace, Jamaica.[73][74] Marcus Garvey, who is considered a prophet by many Rastafarians,[75][76] rose to prominence and cultivated many of his ideas in the United States.\\r\\nBuddhism entered the US during the 19th century with the arrival of the first immigrants from East Asia. The first Buddhist temple was established in San Francisco in 1853 by Chinese Americans.\\r\\nDuring the late 19th century Buddhist missionaries from Japan came to the US. During the same time period, US intellectuals started to take interest in Buddhism.\\r\\nThe first prominent US citizen to publicly convert to Buddhism was Henry Steel Olcott in 1880 who is still honored in Sri Lanka for these efforts.. An event that contributed to the strengthening of Buddhism in the US was the Parliament of the World's Religions in 1893, which was attended by many Buddhist delegates sent from India, China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand and Sri Lanka.\\r\\nThe early 20th century was characterized by a continuation of tendencies that had their roots in the 19th century. The second half, by contrast, saw the emergence of new approaches, and the move of Buddhism into the mainstream and making itself a mass and social religious phenomenon.[77][78]\\r\\nEstimates of the number of Buddhists in the United States vary between 0.5%[44] and 0.9%,[79] with 0.7% reported by both the CIA[55] and Pew.[80] According to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies newsletter published March, 2017, based on data from 2010, Buddhists were the largest minority religion in 186 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country.[17]\\r\\nHinduism is the fourth largest faith in the United States, representing 0.7% of the population.[2] The first time Hinduism entered the U.S. is not clearly identifiable. However, large groups of Hindus have immigrated from India and other Asian countries since the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. During the 1960s and 1970s Hinduism exercised fascination contributing to the development of New Age thought. During the same decades the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (a Vaishnavite Hindu reform organization) was founded in the US.\\r\\nIn 2001, there were an estimated 766,000 Hindus in the US, about 0.2% of the total population.[81][82] According to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies newsletter published March, 2017, based on data from 2010, Hindus were the largest minority religion in 92 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country.[17]\\r\\nIn 2004 the Hindu American Foundationa national institution protecting rights of the Hindu community of U.S.was founded.\\r\\nAmerican Hindus have one of the highest rates of educational attainment and household income among all religious communities, and tend to have lower divorce rates.[46]\\r\\nAdherents of Jainism first arrived in the United States in the 20th century. The most significant time of Jain immigration was in the early 1970s. The United States has since become a center of the Jain Diaspora. The Federation of Jain Associations in North America is an umbrella organization of local American and Canadian Jain congregations to preserve, practice, and promote Jainism and the Jain way of life.[83]\\r\\nSikhism is a religion originating from South Asia (predominantly in modern-day India) which was introduced into the United States when, around the turn of the 20th century, Sikhs started emigrating to the United States in significant numbers to work on farms in California. They were the first community to come from India to the US in large numbers.[84][clarification needed] The first Sikh Gurdwara in America was built in Stockton, California, in 1912.[85] In 2007, there were estimated to be between 250,000 and 500,000 Sikhs living in the United States, with the largest populations living on the East and West Coasts, with additional populations in Detroit, Chicago, and Austin.[86][87]\\r\\nThe United States also has a number of non-Punjabi converts to Sikhism.[88]\\r\\nIn 2004 there were an estimated 56,000 Taoists in the US.[89] Taoism was popularized throughout the world through the writings and teachings of Lao Tzu and other Taoists as well as the practice of Qigong, Tai Chi Chuan and other Chinese martial arts.[90]\\r\\nThis group includes atheists, agnostics and people who describe their religion as \\"nothing in particular\\".[91]\\r\\n\\"Unaffiliated\\" does not necessarily mean \\"non-religious\\". Some people who are unaffiliated with any particular religion express religious beliefs (such as belief in one or more gods or in reincarnation) and engage in religious practices (such as prayer).[citation needed]\\r\\nA 2001 survey directed by Dr. Ariela Keysar for the City University of New York indicated that, amongst the more than 100 categories of response, \\"no religious identification\\" had the greatest increase in population in both absolute and percentage terms. This category included atheists, agnostics, humanists, and others with no stated religious preferences. Figures are up from 14.3?million in 1990 to 34.2?million in 2008, representing an increase from 8% of the total population in 1990 to 15% in 2008.[44] A nationwide Pew Research study published in 2008 put the figure of unaffiliated persons at 16.1%,[82] while another Pew study published in 2012 was described as placing the proportion at about 20% overall and roughly 33% for the 18ÿ29-year-old demographic.[92]\\r\\nIn a 2006 nationwide poll, University of Minnesota researchers found that despite an increasing acceptance of religious diversity, atheists were generally distrusted by other Americans, who trusted them less than Muslims, recent immigrants and other minority groups in \\"sharing their vision of American society\\". They also associated atheists with undesirable attributes such as amorality, criminal behavior, rampant materialism and cultural elitism.[93][94] However, the same study also reported that \\"The researchers also found acceptance or rejection of atheists is related not only to personal religiosity, but also to one's exposure to diversity, education and political orientation ÿ with more educated, East and West Coast Americans more accepting of atheists than their Midwestern counterparts.\\"[95] Some surveys have indicated that doubts about the existence of the divine were growing quickly among Americans under 30.[96]\\r\\nOn 24 March 2012, American atheists sponsored the Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., followed by the American Atheist Convention in Bethesda, Maryland. Organizers called the estimated crowd of 8,000ÿ10,000 the largest-ever US gathering of atheists in one place.[97]\\r\\nIn the United States, Enlightenment philosophy (which itself was heavily inspired by deist ideals) played a major role in creating the principle of religious freedom, expressed in Thomas Jefferson's letters and included in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. American Founding Fathers, or Framers of the Constitution, who were especially noted for being influenced by such philosophy of deism include Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Cornelius Harnett, Gouverneur Morris, and Hugh Williamson. Their political speeches show distinct deistic influence. Other notable Founding Fathers may have been more directly deist. These include Thomas Paine, James Madison, possibly Alexander Hamilton, and Ethan Allen.[98]\\r\\nVarious polls have been conducted to determine Americans' actual beliefs regarding a god:\\r\\n\\"Spiritual but not religious\\" (SBNR) is self-identified stance of spirituality that takes issue with organized religion as the sole or most valuable means of furthering spiritual growth. Spirituality places an emphasis upon the wellbeing of the \\"mind-body-spirit,\\"[106] so holistic activities such as tai chi, reiki, and yoga are common within the SBNR movement.[107] In contrast to religion, spirituality has often been associated with the interior life of the individual.[108]\\r\\nOne fifth of the US public and a third of adults under the age of 30 are reportedly unaffiliated with any religion, however they identify as being spiritual in some way. Of these religiously unaffiliated Americans, 37% classify themselves as spiritual but not religious.[109]\\r\\nMany other religions are represented in the United States, including Shinto, Caodaism, Thelema, Santera, Kemetism, Religio Romana, Kaldanism, Zoroastrianism, Vodou, Pastafarianism, and many forms of New Age spirituality.\\r\\nNative American religions historically exhibited much diversity, and are often characterized by animism or panentheism.[110] The membership of Native American religions in the 21st century comprises about 9,000 people.[111]\\r\\nNeopaganism in the United States is represented by widely different movements and organizations. The largest Neopagan religion is Wicca, followed by Neo-Druidism.[112][113] Other neopagan movements include Germanic Neopaganism, Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism, Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism, and Semitic neopaganism.\\r\\nAccording to the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS), there are approximately 30,000 druids in the United States.[114] Modern Druidism came to North America first in the form of fraternal Druidic organizations in the nineteenth century, and orders such as the Ancient Order of Druids in America were founded as distinct American groups as early as 1912. In 1963, the Reformed Druids of North America (RDNA) was founded by students at Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota. They adopted elements of Neopaganism into their practices, for instance celebrating the festivals of the Wheel of the Year.[115]\\r\\nWicca advanced in North America in the 1960s by Raymond Buckland, an expatriate Briton who visited Gardner's Isle of Man coven to gain initiation.[116] Universal Eclectic Wicca was popularized in 1969 for a diverse membership drawing from both Dianic and British Traditional Wiccan backgrounds.[117]\\r\\nA group of churches which started in the 1830s in the United States is known under the banner of \\"New Thought\\". These churches share a spiritual, metaphysical and mystical predisposition and understanding of the Bible and were strongly influenced by the Transcendentalist movement, particularly the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Another antecedent of this movement was Swedenborgianism, founded on the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg in 1787.[118] The New Thought concept was named by Emma Curtis Hopkins (\\"teacher of teachers\\") after Hopkins broke off from Mary Baker Eddy's Church of Christ, Scientist. The movement had been previously known as the Mental Sciences or the Christian Sciences. The three major branches are Religious Science, Unity Church and Divine Science.\\r\\nUnitarian Universalists (UU's) are among the most liberal of all religious denominations in America[119]. The shared creed includes beliefs in inherent dignity, a common search for truth, respect for beliefs of others, compassion, and social action.[120] They are unified by their shared search for spiritual growth and by the understanding that an individual's theology is a result of that search and not obedience to an authoritarian requirement.[121]. UU's have historical ties to anti-war, civil rights, and LGBT rights movements[122], as well as providing inclusive church services for the broad spectrum of liberal Christians, liberal Jews, secular humanists, LGBT, Jewish-Christian parents and partners, Earth-centered/Wicca, and Buddhist meditation adherents.[123]\\r\\nThe First Amendment guarantees both the free practice of religion and the non-establishment of religion by the federal government (later court decisions have extended that prohibition to the states).[125] The U.S. Pledge of Allegiance was modified in 1954 to add the phrase \\"under God\\", in order to distinguish itself from the state atheism espoused by the Soviet Union.[126][127][128][129]\\r\\nVarious American presidents have often stated the importance of religion. On February 20, 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower stated that \\"Recognition of the Supreme Being is the first, the most basic, expression of Americanism.\\"[130] President Gerald Ford agreed with and repeated this statement in 1974.[131]\\r\\nThe U.S. Census does not ask about religion. Various groups have conducted surveys to determine approximate percentages of those affiliated with each religious group.\\r\\nReligion in the United States according to Gallup, Inc. (2016)[132]\\r\\nReligion in the United States according to the Pew Research Center (2014)[2]\\r\\nA 2013 survey reported that 31% of Americans attend religious services at least weekly. It was conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute with a margin of error of 2.5.[134]\\r\\nIn 2006, an online Harris Poll (they stated that the magnitude of errors cannot be estimated due to sampling errors, non-response, etc.; 2,010 U.S. adults were surveyed)[135] found that 26% of those surveyed attended religious services \\"every week or more often\\", 9% went \\"once or twice a month\\", 21% went \\"a few times a year\\", 3% went \\"once a year\\", 22% went \\"less than once a year\\", and 18% never attend religious services.\\r\\nIn a 2009 Gallup International survey, 41.6%[136] of American citizens said that they attended a church, synagogue, or mosque once a week or almost every week. This percentage is higher than other surveyed Western countries.[137][138] Church attendance varies considerably by state and region. The figures, updated to 2014, ranged from 51% in Utah to 17% in Vermont.\\r\\nIn August 2010, 67% of Americans said religion was losing influence, compared with 59% who said this in 2006. Majorities of white evangelical Protestants (79%), white mainline Protestants (67%), black Protestants (56%), Catholics (71%), and the religiously unaffiliated (62%) all agreed that religion was losing influence on American life; 53% of the total public said this was a bad thing, while just 10% see it as a good thing.[140]\\r\\nPoliticians frequently discuss their religion when campaigning, and fundamentalists and black Protestants are highly politically active. However, to keep their status as tax-exempt organizations they must not officially endorse a candidate. Historically Catholics were heavily Democratic before the 1970s, while mainline Protestants comprised the core of the Republican Party. Those patterns have faded awayCatholics, for example, now split about 50ÿ50. However, white evangelicals since 1980 have made up a solidly Republican group that favors conservative candidates. Secular voters are increasingly Democratic.[141]\\r\\nOnly three presidential candidates for major parties have been Catholics, all for the Democratic party:\\r\\nJoe Biden is the first Catholic vice president.[143]\\r\\nJoe Lieberman was the first major presidential candidate that was Jewish, on the Gore-Lieberman campaign of 2000 (although John Kerry and Barry Goldwater both had Jewish ancestry, they were practicing Christians). Bernie Sanders ran against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary of 2016. He was the first major Jewish candidate to compete in the presidential primary process. However, Sanders noted during the campaign that he does not actively practice any religion.[144]\\r\\nIn 2006 Keith Ellison of Minnesota became the first Muslim elected to Congress; when re-enacting his swearing-in for photos, he used the copy of the Qur'an once owned by Thomas Jefferson.[145] Andr Carson is the second Muslim to serve in Congress.\\r\\nA Gallup poll released in 2007[146] indicated that 53% of Americans would refuse to vote for an atheist as president, up from 48% in 1987 and 1999. But then the number started to drop again and reached record low 43% in 2012 and 40% in 2015.[147][148]\\r\\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, is Mormon and a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He is the former governor of the state of Massachusetts, and his father George Romney was the governor of the state of Michigan. The Romneys were involved in Mormonism in their states and in the state of Utah.\\r\\nOn January 3, 2013, Tulsi Gabbard became the first Hindu member of Congress, using a copy of the Bhagavad Gita while swearing-in.[149]\\r\\nThe table below is based mainly on data reported by individual denominations to the Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches, and published in 2011 by the National Council of Churches of Christ in USA. It only includes religious bodies reporting 60,000 or more members. The definition of a member is determined by each religious body.[150]\\r\\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) surveyed congregations for their memberships. Churches were asked for their membership numbers. Adjustments were made for those congregations that did not respond and for religious groups that reported only adult membership.[151] ARDA estimates that most of the churches not responding were black Protestant congregations. Significant difference in results from other databases include the lower representation of adherents of 1) all kinds (62.7%), 2) Christians (59.9%), 3) Protestants (less than 36%); and the greater number of unaffiliated (37.3%).\\r\\nThe United States government does not collect religious data in its census. The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) of 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461 American residential households in the contiguous United States. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.\\r\\nAdult respondents were asked the open-ended question, \\"What is your religion, if any?\\" Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was \\"Protestant\\" or \\"Christian\\" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions.\\r\\nReligious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008[44]\\r\\nFigures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of \\"no religion\\" than any other group.\\r\\nHighlights:[44]\\r\\nThe table below shows the religious affiliations among the ethnicities in the United States, according to the Pew Forum 2014 survey.[2] People of Black ethnicity were most likely to be part of a formal religion, with 85% percent being Christians.

Asia is the most populous continent, with its 4.54 billion inhabitants accounting for 60% of the world population. The world's two most populated countries, China and India, together constitute about 36% of the world's population. Africa is the second most populated continent, with around 1.28 billion people, or 16% of the world's population. Europe's 742 million people make up 10% of the world's population as of 2018, while the Latin American and Caribbean regions are home to around 651 million (9%). Northern America, primarily consisting of the United States and Canada, has a population of around 363 million (5%), and Oceania, the least-populated region, has about 41 million inhabitants (0.5%).[9] Though it is not permanently inhabited by any fixed population, Antarctica has a small, fluctuating international population based mainly in polar science stations. This population tends to rise in the summer months and decrease significantly in winter, as visiting researchers return to their home countries.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimates of world population by their nature are an aspect of modernity, possible only since the Age of Discovery. Early estimates for the population of the world[12] date to the 17th century: William Petty in 1682 estimated world population at  320 million (modern estimates ranging close to twice this number); by the late 18th century, estimates ranged close to one billion (consistent with modern estimates).[13] More refined estimates, broken down by continents, were published in the first half of the 19th century, at 600 to 1000 million in the early 1800s and at 800 to 1000 million in the 1840s.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15 million.[15][16]  Even earlier, genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BC, according to the Toba catastrophe theory. By contrast, it is estimated that around 50ÿ60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plague of Justinian, which first emerged during the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian, caused Europe's population to drop by around 50% between the 6th and 8th centuries AD.[18] The population of Europe was more than 70 million in 1340.[19] The Black Death pandemic of the 14th century may have reduced the world's population from an estimated 450 million in 1340 to between 350 and 375 million in 1400;[20] it took 200 years for population figures to recover.[21] The population of China decreased from 123 million in 1200 to 65 million in 1393,[22] presumably due to a combination of Mongol invasions, famine, and plague.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in AD 2, the Han Dynasty of ancient China kept consistent family registers in order to properly assess the poll taxes and labor service duties of each household.[24] In that year, the population of Western Han was recorded as 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households, decreasing to 47,566,772 individuals in 9,348,227 households by AD 146, towards the End of the Han Dynasty.[24] At the founding of the Ming Dynasty in 1368, China's population was reported to be close to 60 million; toward the end of the dynasty in 1644, it may have approached 150 million.[25] England's population reached an estimated 5.6 million in 1650, up from an estimated 2.6 million in 1500.[26] New crops that were brought to Asia and Europe from the Americas by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 16th century are believed to have contributed to population growth.[27][28][29] Since their introduction to Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century,[30] maize and cassava have similarly replaced traditional African crops as the most important staple food crops grown on the continent.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pre-Columbian North American population probably numbered somewhere between 2 million and 18 million.[32] Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence.[33] According to the most extreme scholarly claims, as many as 90% of the Native American population of the New World died due to Old World diseases such as smallpox, measles and influenza.[34] Over the centuries, the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases, while the indigenous peoples had no such immunity.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the European Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.[38] The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730ÿ1749 to 31.8% in 1810ÿ1829.[39][40] Between 1700 and 1900, Europes population increased from about 100 million to over 400 million.[41] Altogether, the areas populated by people of European descent comprised 36% of the world's population in 1900.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nPopulation growth in the West became more rapid after the introduction of vaccination and other improvements in medicine and sanitation.[43] Improved material conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 19th century.[44] The population of the United Kingdom reached 60 million in 2006.[45] The United States saw its population grow from around 5.3 million in 1800 to 106 million in 1920, exceeding 307 million in 2010.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first half of the 20th century in Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union was marked by a succession of major wars, famines and other disasters which caused large-scale population losses (approximately 60 million excess deaths).[47][48] After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's population declined significantly ÿ from 150 million in 1991 to 143 million in 2012[49] ÿ but by 2013 this decline appeared to have halted.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany countries in the developing world have experienced extremely rapid population growth since the early 20th century, due to economic development and improvements in public health. China's population rose from approximately 430 million in 1850 to 580 million in 1953,[51] and now stands at over 1.3 billion. The population of the Indian subcontinent, which was about 125 million in 1750, increased to 389 million in 1941;[52] today, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are collectively home to about 1.63 billion people.[53] Java had about 5 million inhabitants in 1815; its present-day successor, Indonesia, now has a population of over 140 million.[54] In just one hundred years, the population of Brazil decupled (x10), from about 17 million in 1900, or about 1% of the world population in that year, to about 176 million in 2000, or almost 3% of the global population in the very early 21st century. Mexico's population grew from 13.6 million in 1900 to about 112 million in 2010.[55][56] Between the 1920s and 2000s, Kenya's population grew from 2.9 million to 37 million.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is estimated that the world population reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It was another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to reach three billion in 1960.[58] Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, according to the United States Census Bureau, seven billion in March 2012.[59] The United Nations, however, estimated that the world population reached seven billion in October 2011.[60][61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to current projections, the global population will reach eight billion by 2024, and is likely to reach around nine billion by 2042. Alternative scenarios for 2050 range from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion.[63] Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations, especially the fertility variable. Long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the \\"low scenario\\", to \\"high scenarios\\" of 24.8 billion.[63] One extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150, assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 3.04 children per woman; however, by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 2.52.[64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed one or two billion. The points at which it reached three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau placed them in July 1959 and April 1974 respectively. The United Nations did determine, and commemorate, the \\"Day of 5 Billion\\" on July 11, 1987, and the \\"Day of 6 Billion\\" on October 12, 1999. The Population Division of the United Nations declared the \\"Day of 7 Billion\\" to be October 31, 2011.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2012, the global sex ratio is approximately 1.01 males to 1 female. The greater number of men is possibly due to the significant sex imbalances evident in the Indian and Chinese populations.[68][69] Approximately 26.3% of the global population is aged under 15, while 65.9% is aged 15ÿ64 and 7.9% is aged 65 or over.[68] The median age of the world's population was estimated to be 29.7 years in 2014,[70] and is expected to rise to 37.9 years by 2050.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the global average life expectancy is 71.4 years as of 2015, with women living an average of 74 years and men approximately 69 years.[67] In 2010, the global fertility rate was estimated at 2.52 children per woman.[65] In June 2012, British researchers calculated the total weight of Earth's human population as approximately 287 million tonnes, with the average person weighing around 62 kilograms (137?lb).[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CIA estimated nominal 2013 gross world product at US$74.31 trillion, giving an annual global per capita figure of around US$10,500.[73] Around 1.29 billion people (18.4% of the world population) live in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than US$1.25 per day;[74] approximately 870 million people (12.25%) are undernourished.[75] 83% of the world's over-15s are considered literate.[68] In June 2014, there were around 3.03 billion global Internet users, constituting 42.3% of the world population.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Han Chinese are the world's largest single ethnic group, constituting over 19% of the global population in 2011.[77] The world's most-spoken first languages are Mandarin Chinese (spoken by 12.44% of the world's population), Spanish (4.85%), English (4.83%), Arabic (3.25%) and Hindustani (2.68%).[68] The world's largest religion is Christianity, whose adherents account for 31% of the global population; Islam is the second-largest religion, accounting for 24.1%, and Hinduism the third, accounting for 13.78%.[68] In 2005, around 16% of the global population were reported to be non-religious.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 4.37 billion people live in these ten countries, representing around 57% of the world's population as of July 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tables below list the world's most densely populated countries, both in absolute terms and in comparison to their total populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nPopulation size fluctuates at differing rates in differing regions. Nonetheless, population growth is the long-standing trend on all inhabited continents, as well as in most individual states. During the 20th century, the global population saw its greatest increase in known history, rising from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to over 6 billion in 2000. A number of factors contributed to this increase, including the lessening of the mortality rate in many countries by improved sanitation and medical advances, and a massive increase in agricultural productivity attributed to the Green Revolution.[90][91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, the United Nations estimated that the world's population was growing at an annual rate of 1.14% (equivalent to around 75 million people),[93] down from a peak of 88 million per year in 1989. By 2000, there were approximately ten times as many people on Earth as there had been in 1700. Globally, the population growth rate has been steadily declining from its peak of 2.19% in 1963, but growth remains high in Latin America, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2010s, Japan and some countries in Europe began to encounter negative population growth (i.e. a net decrease in population over time), due to sub-replacement fertility rates.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the United Nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global demographic transition. If this trend continues, the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050, concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion.[95] However, this is only one of many estimates published by the UN; in 2009, UN population projections for 2050 ranged between around 8 billion and 10.5 billion.[96] An alternative scenario is given by the statistician Jorgen Randers, who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility. Randers' \\"most likely scenario\\" reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people, followed by decline.[97] Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington professor of statistics and of sociology, states that \\"theres a 70 percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century. Population, which had sort of fallen off the worlds agenda, remains a very important issue.\\"[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimated world population figures, 10,000?BCÿAD 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimated world population figures, 10,000?BCÿAD 2000 (in log y scale)\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld population figures, 1950ÿ2000\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimated global growth rates, 1950ÿ2050\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimated and projected populations of the world and its continents (except Antarctica) from 1950 to 2100.

The data for 1750 to 1900 are from the UN report \\"The World at Six Billion\\"[105] whereas the data from 1950 to 2015 are from a UN data sheet.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the above figures, the change in population from 2010 to 2015 was:\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-term global population growth is difficult to predict. The United Nations and the US Census Bureau both give different estimates ÿ according to the UN, the world population reached seven billion in late 2011,[99] while the USCB asserted that this occurred in March 2012.[110] The UN has issued multiple projections of future world population, based on different assumptions. From 2000 to 2005, the UN consistently revised these projections downward, until the 2006 revision, issued on March 14, 2007, revised the 2050 mid-range estimate upwards by 273 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nAverage global birth rates are declining fast, but vary greatly between developed countries (where birth rates are often at or below replacement levels) and developing countries (where birth rates typically remain high). Different ethnicities also display varying birth rates. Death rates can change rapidly due to disease epidemics, wars and other mass catastrophes, or advances in medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\n2012 United projections show a continued increase in population in the near future with a steady decline in population growth rate; the global population is expected to reach between 8.3?and 10.9?billion by 2050.[111][112] 2003 UN Population Division population projections for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion.[64] One of many independent mathematical models supports the lower estimate,[113] while a 2014 estimate forecasts between 9.3 and 12.6 billion in 2100, and continued growth thereafter.[114][115] Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth, highlighting the growing pressures on the environment, global food supplies, and energy resources.[116][117][118]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, Sebastian von Hoerner proposed a formula for population growth which represented hyperbolic growth with an infinite population in 2025.[121] The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development. This feedback can be described as follows: technological advance L increase in the carrying capacity of land for people L demographic growth L more people L more potential inventors L acceleration of technological advance L accelerating growth of the carrying capacity L faster population growth L accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors L faster technological advance L hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.[122] The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Russian demographer Sergey Kapitsa,[123] the world population grew between 67,000 BC and 1965 according to the following formula:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to linear interpolation and extrapolation of UNDESA population estimates, the world population has doubled, or will double, in the years listed in the tables below (with two different starting points). During the 2nd millennium, each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling, fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above. However, after 2024, it is unlikely that there will be another doubling of the global population in the 21st century.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his 1798 work An Essay on the Principle of Population, the British scholar Thomas Malthus incorrectly predicted that continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid-19th century. Malthus wrote the essay to refute what he considered the unattainable utopian ideas of William Godwin and Marquis de Condorcet, as presented in Political Justice and The Future Progress of the Human Mind. In 1968, Paul R. Ehrlich reprised Malthus' argument in The Population Bomb, predicting that mass global famine would occur in the 1970s and 1980s.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predictions of Ehrlich and other neo-Malthusians were vigorously challenged by a number of economists, notably Julian Lincoln Simon, and advances in agriculture, collectively known as the Green Revolution, forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the world, grain production increased by over 250%.[127] The world population has grown by over four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution, but food production has so far kept pace with population growth. Most scholars believe that, without the Revolution, there would be greater levels of famine and malnutrition than the UN presently documents.[128] However, neo-Malthusians point out that fossil fuels provided the energy for the Green Revolution, in the form of natural gas-derived fertilizers, oil-derived pesticides, and hydrocarbon-fueled irrigation, and that many crops have become so genetically uniform that a crop failure in any one country could potentially have global repercussions.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, a meta-analysis of 70 quantitative studies estimating a sustainable limit to the world population generated a meta-estimate of 7.7 billion people.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2008, the price of grain was pushed up severely by the increased cultivation of biofuels, the increase of world oil prices to over $140 per barrel ($880/m3),[131] global population growth,[132] the effects of climate change,[133] the loss of agricultural land to residential and industrial development,[134][135] and growing consumer demand in the population centres of China and India.[136][137] Food riots subsequently occurred in some countries.[138][139] However, oil prices then fell sharply. Resource demands are expected to ease as population growth declines, but it is unclear whether mass food wastage and rising living standards in developing countries will once again create resource shortages.[140][141]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University, estimates that the sustainable agricultural carrying capacity for the United States is about 200 million people; its population as of 2015 is over 300 million.[142] In 2009, the UK government's chief scientific advisor, Professor John Beddington, warned that growing populations, falling energy reserves and food shortages would create a \\"perfect storm\\" of shortages of food, water, and energy by 2030.[125][143] According to a 2009 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the world will have to produce 70% more food by 2050 to feed a projected extra 2.3 billion people.[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observed figures for 2007 showed an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world, with 923 million undernourished in 2007, versus 832 million in 1995.[145] The 2009 FAO estimates showed an even more dramatic increase, to 1.02 billion.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of scientists have argued that the current global population expansion and accompanying increase in resource consumption threatens the world's ecosystem.[147][148]\\r\\nThe InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth, which was ratified by 58 member national academies in 1994, states that \\"unprecedented\\" population growth aggravates many environmental problems, including rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, global warming, and pollution.[149] Indeed, some analysts claim that overpopulation's most serious impact is its effect on the environment.[117]\\r\\nThe situation has continued to worsen, as at the time of the 1994 IAP statement, the world population stood at 5.5 billion and lower-bound scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050, a number that current estimates state will be reached in the late 2020s.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists contend that human overpopulation, continued human population growth and overconsumption, particularly by the wealthy, are the primary drivers of mass species extinction.[150][151][152][153] By 2050 population growth, along with profligate consumption, could result in oceans containing more plastic than fish by weight.[152] In November 2017, a statement by 15,364 scientists from 184 countries asserted that rapid human population growth is the \\"primary driver behind many ecological and even societal threats.\\"[154]\\r\\n\\r\\nA July 2017 study published in Environmental Research Letters argued that the most significant way individuals could mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have fewer children, followed by living without a vehicle, forgoing air travel and adopting a plant-based diet.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman population control is the practice of intervening to alter the rate of population growth. Historically, human population control has been implemented by limiting a region's birth rate, by voluntary contraception or by government mandate. It has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty, environmental concerns, and religious reasons. The use of abortion in some population control strategies has caused controversy,[156] with religious organizations such as the Roman Catholic Church explicitly opposing any intervention in the human reproductive process.[157]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Nebraska publication Green Illusions argues that population control to alleviate environmental pressures need not be coercive. It states that \\"Women who are educated, economically engaged, and in control of their own bodies can enjoy the freedom of bearing children at their own pace, which happens to be a rate that is appropriate for the aggregate ecological endowment of our planet.\\"[158] The book Fatal Misconception by Matthew Connelly similarly points to the importance of supporting the rights of women in bringing population levels down over time.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nLists:\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorical:\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganizations\\r\\n\\r\\nStatistics and maps\\r\\n\\r\\nPopulation clocks","input":"When did the world population reach 7 billion?"},{"output":"Love Me Tender","context":"Elvis Presley (1935ÿ1977) was an American entertainer who achieved initial success as a singer, expressing an early career goal of following in the footsteps of his role models James Dean and Marlon Brando to become a top dramatic actor.[1] His manager Colonel Tom Parker's persistent lobbying of William Morris Agency president Abe Lastfogel for a Presley screen test paid off on March 26, 1956, when the singer auditioned at Paramount for a supporting role in The Rainmaker.[2] Although not chosen for the part, he signed a contract with Paramount producer Hal Wallis on April 25 that also allowed him to make films with other studios.[3]\\r\\nHis feature debut was in Love Me Tender for 20th Century Fox, with the commercial success of the soundtrack EP being a bellwether for the next three Presley films. Loving You, Jailhouse Rock and King Creole were dramatic storylines written around Presley in the role of a musical entertainer.[4] He would later state that King Creole was his favorite of all his films.[5] Flaming Star and Wild in the Country were rarities in his career, non-musicals focused on dramatic storylines. According to music historian Peter Guralnick, the sluggish financial returns of those two films became the justification for ignoring Presley's wishes and limiting him to the more profitable musical format.[6]\\r\\nPresley became bitter that his hopes for dramatic roles were not coming to fruition,[7] stating that Clambake was his worst film. He began to complain about the deteriorating quality of the films and his belief that his manager's objectives were more monetary than anything else.[8] At the expiration of all studio contracts, he returned to live entertaining. The two concert documentaries Elvis: That's the Way It Is in 1970 and Elvis on Tour in 1972 were the final theatrical releases for Presley.[9]","input":"What was the first movie elvis presley made?"},{"output":"a Mesoamerican culture that flourished in central Mexico in the post-classic period from 1300 to 1521","context":"","input":"Who were the aztecs and where did they live?"},{"output":"Malibu, California","context":"Elizabeth Woolridge Grant (born June 21, 1985),[1] known professionally as Lana Del Rey, is an American singer and songwriter. Her music has been noted by critics for its stylized cinematic quality, its preoccupation with themes of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia, and its references to pop culture, particularly 1950s and 1960s Americana.[2][3]\\r\\nRaised in Upstate New York, Del Rey moved to New York City in 2005 to embark on her music career. Following numerous projects including her debut studio album and the unreleased Sirens, Del Rey's breakthrough came after the viral success of her single \\"Video Games\\" in 2011.[4] She would then sign with Interscope and Polydor later that year.

I was interested in God and how technology could bring us closer to finding out where we came from and why.\\"[6][15][26] According to Del Rey, she had trouble making friends in both boarding school and college.[27][28] She lived in The Bronx[29] while attending Fordham. Before graduating in 2008, she moved to North Bergen, New Jersey. She was also a Brooklyn resident for four years.[20]\\r\\nIn college, Del Rey did volunteer work at homeless youth and drug and alcohol outreach programs, as well as helping paint and rebuild houses on an Indian reservation in Utah.[13] She would cite this trip as integral in her decision to become a songwriter: \\"I remember exactly when I decided that I wanted to be a singer. I was in college, [and] we went to the Indian reservation. That day I realized that I had only two options: either making music or volunteering for a good cause. I chose the first option. If it [had] not [worked], I would [have] probably [done] social work in any small town.\\"[30]\\r\\nDel Rey explaining why she went into the music industry.[28]\\r\\nOn April 25, 2005, a seven-track extended play was registered under Elizabeth Woolridge Grant with the United States Copyright Office. The application title was Rock Me Stable with another title Young Like Me also listed.[31] A second extended play, titled From the End, was also recorded under Del Rey's stage name at the time, May Jailer.[32] Between 2005 and 2006, she recorded an acoustic album titled Sirens under the May Jailer project,[32] which later leaked on the internet in mid-2012.[b]\\r\\nAt her first performance in 2006 for the Williamsburg Live Songwriting Competition, Del Rey met Van Wilson, an A&R representative for 5?Points Records,[38][39] an independent label owned by David Nichtern.[39] In 2007, while a senior at Fordham, Del Rey submitted a demo tape of acoustic tracks titled No Kung Fu to 5?Points Records,[32] who subsequently offered her a recording contract for $10,000.[32] Del Rey used the money to relocate to Manhattan Mobile Home Park, a trailer park in North Bergen, New Jersey,[6][20] and subsequently began working with producer David Kahne,[39] with whom she released a three-track EP titled Kill Kill in October 2008 as Lizzy Grant.[40] She explained that \\"David asked to work with me only a day after he got my demo. He is known as a producer with a lot of integrity and who had an interest in making music that wasn't just pop.\\"[41] The album, however, was shelved, causing her to shift her focus: She began to work in community service. \\"Homeless outreach, drug, and alcohol rehabilitationthat's been my life for the past five years\\", she told Vogue UK in 2012.[6] Her debut full-length album, titled Lana Del Ray, was released in January 2010.[42] Her father, Robert Grant, helped with the marketing of the album,[42] which was available for purchase on iTunes for a brief period before being withdrawn.\\r\\nDavid Kahne, who produced Grant and previous label owner David Nichtern have both stated that Grant bought the rights back from her label, 5 Points, as she wanted it out of circulation to \\"stifle future opportunities to distribute itan echo of rumors that the action was part of a calculated strategy.[43][44]\\r\\nDel Rey met her current managers, Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, three months after Lana Del Ray and they helped her to get out of her contract with 5 Points Records, where, in her opinion, \\"nothing was happening.\\" Shortly after, she moved to London, and moved in with Mawson \\"for a few years.\\"[13] When choosing her stage name, she said: \\"I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba ÿ Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.\\"[45] She has said her lawyers and managers made up the name Lana Del Rey and persuaded her to adopt it.[46] On September 1, 2010, Del Rey was featured by Mando Diao in their MTV Unplugged concert at Union Film-Studios in Berlin.[47]\\r\\nAfter uploading them to her YouTube channel in 2011, Del Rey's videos for the songs \\"Video Games\\" and \\"Blue Jeans\\" became viral internet sensations,[2] and she was signed by Stranger Records to release \\"Video Games\\" as her debut single.[48] She told The Observer, \\"I just put that song online a few months ago because it was my favorite. To be honest, it wasn't going to be the single but people have really responded to it.\\"[6] The song earned her a Q award for \\"Next Big Thing\\" in October 2011[49] and an Ivor Novello for \\"Best Contemporary Song\\" in 2012.[50] The same month, she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and Polydor to work on her second studio album Born to Die.[25][51][52][53]\\r\\nDel Rey built anticipation to the album by doing a number of live appearances, such as promotional concerts at the Bowery Ballroom and at the Chateau Marmont, and with performances at television shows such as De Wereld Draait Door, and Later... with Jools Holland.[54][55][56][57]\\r\\nDel Rey also performed two songs from the album on Saturday Night Live on January 14, 2012 and received a negative response from critics and the general public. Del Rey's performance was defended by the evening program's guest host, actor Daniel Radcliffe, despite not having seen her performance.[58] She had earlier defended her spot on the program, saying: \\"I'm a good musician [...] I have been singing for a long time, and I think that [SNL creator] Lorne Michaels knows that [...] it's not a fluke decision.\\"[59] The following week on SNL, Kristen Wiig impersonated Del Rey where she humorously defended herself during Weekend Update.[60]\\r\\nBorn to Die was officially released on January 31, 2012 worldwide, and reached number one in 11 countries, though critical reaction was divided.[61][62] The same week, she announced she had bought back the rights to her 2010 debut album, and had plans to re-release it in the summer of 2012 under Interscope Records and Polydor.[63] Contrary to Del Rey's press statement, her previous record label and producer David Kahne have both stated that she bought the rights to the album when she and the label parted company, due to the offer of a new deal, in April 2010.[51][64] Born to Die sold 3.4?million copies in 2012, making it the fifth-best-selling album of 2012.[65][66][67] In the United States, Born to Die charted on the Billboard 200 album chart well into 2012, lingering at number 76, after 36?weeks on the chart.[68] In an interview with RTVE on June 15, 2012, she announced her new album would be out in November.[69] Mid-September saw the official announcement of Paradise's lead single, \\"Ride\\".[70][71]\\r\\nOn September 19, 2012, the music video for \\"Blue Velvet\\" was released through H&M.[72] One day later, on September 20, \\"Blue Velvet\\" became available for purchase as a promotional single. \\"Ride\\" became available for purchase on September 25, 2012. The music video for \\"Ride\\" was premiered at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, California on October 10, 2012.[73][74] Some critics panned the video as pro-prostitution[74][75] and antifeminist, the latter being a word attributed to Del Rey's work since \\"Video Games\\".[76][77]\\r\\nDel Rey's Paradise Edition of Born to Die was set to be released on November 12. With the release of her third EP, Paradise, Del Rey spawned her second top 10 album in the United States, debuting at number 10 on the Billboard 200 with 67,000 copies sold in its first week.[78]\\r\\nAt the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards, Del Rey received nominations in the categories Best Alternative, Best Push, and Best New Act.

Del Rey has also cited \\"Time of the Season\\" by The Zombies and \\"Hotel California\\" by The Eagles as favorites and inspirations.[199]\\r\\nHer favorite films, The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and American Beauty have also inspired her musical style.[200] Inspired by poetry, Del Rey cites Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg as instrumental to her songwriting; specifically, she named Leaves of Grass by Whitman and \\"Howl\\" by Ginsberg. Her song, \\"Body Electric\\" from her third EP, Paradise, alludes to Whitman in the lyric, \\"Whitman is my daddy\\". The song's chorus of \\"I sing the body electric\\" is a direct reference to Whitman's poem \\"I Sing The Body Electric\\".[199][201] She recited Whitman's poem \\"Song of Myself\\" for the French fashion magazine, L'Officiel Paris.[81] Del Rey has also cited the surrealist film directors David Lynch and Federico Fellini and the surrealist painters Mark Ryden and Pablo Picasso as influences.[168][202]\\r\\nDel Rey possesses an expansive contralto vocal range, which spans three-plus octaves and has been described as captivating and highly emotive, ranging from high notes in a girlish timbre to jazzy ornaments in her lower gesture with great ease.[203][204][205][206] Following the release of Ultraviolence, which was recorded live in single takes and lacking Pro Tools vocal editing, critics fell into favor with Del Rey's vocal ability, praising her large range, increased vocal confidence, and uniquely emotive delivery.[207][208][209] When recording in the studio Del Rey is known for vocal multi-layering, which, as it has been noted, is difficult for her to replicate within a live setting, especially with the lack of backing singers to fill out the original vocal style.[203] Stage fright has also been noted as a major contribution to Del Rey's struggles with live performances.[210] However, journalists noted in 2014 that her live performances had increased exponentially in confidence. Billboard deemed the Coachella debut of \\"West Coast\\" to be a \\"star-making performance\\" and lauded the singer's vocal abilities.[211][212] Contemporary music critics have called her voice \\"smoky\\",[213] \\"gravelly\\",[192] and reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe.[192] Upon the 2015 release of Honeymoon, her voice was compared by Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood to those of Julee Cruise and Eartha Kitt.[214]\\r\\nDel Rey started the use of her lower vocals on the tracks from Born to Die, claiming that \\"people weren't taking me very seriously, so I lowered my voice, believing that it would help me stand out. Now I sing quite low... well, for a female anyway\\".[215][216][217]\\r\\n\\"I sing low now, but my voice used to be a lot higher. Because of the way I look, I needed something to ground the entire project. Otherwise I think people would assume I was some airhead singer. Well, I don't think... I know. I've sung one way, and sung another, and I've seen what people are drawn to\\", she said on the topic.[19]\\r\\nCritics have noted Del Rey for her typically simple, but authentic live performances.[218] A September 2017 concert review published in The New York Times noted: \\"For more than an hour, Ms. Del Rey was eerily casual, singing and smiling with the ease of someone performing at singer-songwriter night at the local coffee shop.\\"[218] Another review by Roy Train published in The Hollywood Reporter in 2014 noted \\"a distance in her bonhomie, obvious even from my perch at the opposite end of the stage high above the fray, the chill still palpable.\\"[219]\\r\\nIn 2010, Del Rey acted in a short film called Poolside, which she made with several friends on a reported budget of $400.[220]\\r\\nOn January 4, 2012, it was reported she had signed a deal with Next Model Management agency.[221] H&M confirmed that Del Rey would be modeling and recording a cover version of the popular 1950s prom anthem \\"Blue Velvet\\" for their 2012 Autumn Campaign.[222][223] H&M's 2012 Winter campaign, featuring Lana Del Rey, was released on October 12. This is the second H&M campaign Lana Del Rey is featured in.[224][225][226]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2012, executives announced that Del Rey would endorse their new Jaguar F-Type which was unveiled by Del Rey at the Paris Motor Show in September 2012. Adrian Hallmark, Jaguar's global brand director, explained their choice, saying Del Rey had \\"a unique blend of authenticity and modernity\\".[227][228]\\r\\nThe song \\"Burning Desire\\", which was initially available for immediate digital download upon pre-ordering Del Rey's third EP, Paradise, was later made available for purchase on Amazon.com and 7digital as a stand-alone download on March 19, 2013, one month after its music video hit YouTube. The song serves as the title track to a 13-minute promotional short film for the Jaguar F-Type, called Desire. The film, directed by Adam Smith, was produced by Ridley Scott and stars Damian Lewis.[229][230]\\r\\nIn an interview for L'Officiel's first American edition in early 2018, when asked about Del Rey's interest in making a movie she responded that she had been approached to write a Broadway musical and had recently begun work on it. When asked how long it would be until completion of the work, Del Rey coyly replied, \\"I may finish in two or three years.\\"[231][232]\\r\\nPrior to the release of her debut major label album Born to Die in 2012, Del Rey was the subject of several articles discussing her image and career trajectory.[d] One article by Paul Harris published by The Guardian just a week before the album's release noted the differences between Del Rey's perceived persona in 2008, when she performed as Lizzy Grant, and in the present, as Lana Del Rey.[234] Harris wrote:\\r\\nThe internet has allowed figures like [Del Rey] to come rapidly to the fore of the cultural landscape, whether or not their emergence is planned by a record executive or happens spontaneously from someone's bedroom. It has speeded up the fame cycle. It is worth noting that the huge backlash to Del Rey is happening before her first album has even been released. This reveals a cultural obsession with the \\"authenticity\\" that fans, artists and corporations all prize above all else.[234]\\r\\nTony Simon, a producer who had worked with Del Rey in 2009, defended her against the public claims of inauthenticity and allegations that she was a product of her record label: \\"To be clear, all the detractors saying she's some made-up-by-the-machine pop star are full of shit. While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant.\\"[32]\\r\\nDel Rey would later respond to this in a 2017 interview, stating: \\"I didn't edit myself [on Born to Die] when I could have, because a lot of it's just the way it was. I mean, because I've changed a lot and a lot of those songs, it's not that I don't relate but A lot of it too is I was just kinda nervous. I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like something was a little off. Maybe the thing that was off was that I needed a little more time or something, and also my path was just so windy just to get to having a first record. I feel like I had to figure it out all by myself. Every move was just guesswork.\\"[236]\\r\\nHaving been labeled as antifeminist multiple times in the past,[74][76][77] Del Rey dismissed feminism in June 2014, telling The Fader: \\"For me, the issue of feminism is just not an interesting concept. I'm more interested in, you know, SpaceX and Tesla, what's going to happen with our intergalactic possibilities. Whenever people bring up feminism, I'm like, God. I'm just not really that interested.\\"[237]\\r\\nShe also defended herself against the accusations of antifeminism, saying \\"For me, a true feminist is someone who is a woman who does exactly what she wants. If my choice is to, I don't know, be with a lot of men, or if I enjoy a really physical relationship, I don't think that's necessarily being anti-feminist. For me the argument of feminism never really should have come into the picture. Because I don't know too much about the history of feminism, and so I'm not really a relevant person to bring into the conversation. Everything I was writing was so autobiographical, it could really only be a personal analysis.\\"[238]\\r\\nIn February 2017, Del Rey implied she had plans to take part in a magic binding ritual against Donald Trump on or about February 24, March 26, April 24, May 23,[239] which she again confirmed in July 2017.[240][241]\\r\\nDel Rey stated that she suffered from alcoholism at a young age, but has been sober since 2004.[12] In September 2012, she told GQ:\\r\\nI was a big drinker at the time. I would drink every day. I would drink alone. I thought the whole concept was so fucking cool. A great deal of what I wrote on Born to Die is about these wilderness years. When I write about the thing that I've lost I feel like I'm writing about alcohol because that was the first love of my life. My parents were worried, I was worried. I knew it was a problem when I liked it more than I liked doing anything else. I was like, 'I'm fucked. I am totally fucked'. Like, at first it's fine and you think you have a dark side ÿ it's exciting ÿ and then you realise the dark side wins every time if you decide to indulge in it. It's also a completely different way of living when you know that... a different species of person. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me.[242]\\r\\nShe was in a relationship with Kassidy member Barrie-James O'Neill from August 2011 until June 2014.[243][244][245] Previously, she was in a relationship with alternative rock and anti-folk musician Steven Mertens, who produced her debut album, Lana Del Ray, before it was re-recorded by David Kahne.[13]\\r\\nDel Rey moved to a home near Hancock Park in Los Angeles in June 2014 (after living in New York City and London, England in the previous years), and she resided there with her siblings, Caroline and Charlie, for some time.[246] She relocated to a secluded beach-front home in Malibu, California, in June 2015, after dealing with trespassers at her former house.[247] She also purchased two adjacent mansions (in addition to her Malibu home) in Studio City, Los Angeles in September 2016.[248]\\r\\nDel Rey's left hand is tattooed with the letter \\"M\\", referencing her grandmother, Madeleine,[76] and the word \\"paradise\\".[249] Her right hand is tattooed with the phrase \\"trust no one\\".[250] Del Rey is Roman Catholic.[251]\\r\\nDel Rey's work has earned her numerous awards and nominations; she has won the Q Award for \\"Best New Thing\\", a GQ Award for \\"Woman of the Year\\", two BRIT Awards for \\"International Breakthrough Act\\" and \\"International Female Solo Artist\\", and an EMA for \\"Best Alternative Act\\".\\r\\nIn 2013, she received her first Grammy nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. These nominations include Best Pop Vocal Album for Paradise and Best Song Written for Visual Media for \\"Young and Beautiful\\".[253]\\r\\nIn 2015, Del Rey won the MTV Europe Music Award for \\"Best Alternative\\". She also received the Trailblazer Award at the 2015 Billboard Women in Music event.\\r\\nIn 2016, Del Rey received \\"Best Female Artist of the Year\\" award from The Elle Style Awards by Elle magazine.[254]\\r\\nIn 2017, Del Rey received her received her fourth Grammy nomination at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, in the category Best Pop Vocal Album for Lust for Life.[255]","input":"Where does lana del rey live in la?"},{"output":"late nineteenth century","context":"","input":"When were fingerprints first used to solve a crime?"},{"output":"William Shakespeare","context":"","input":"Who is the author of romeo and juliet?"},{"output":"Arnel Pineda","context":"Arnel Campaner Pineda (born September 5, 1967)[1] is a Filipino singer and songwriter. He came to prominence in the Philippines during the 1980s and internationally in 2007 as the lead singer of the American rock band Journey.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArnel Pineda was born on September 5, 1967 at St. Jude Thaddeus Diagnostic Clinic in Tondo, Manila, Philippines to Restituto Lising Pineda and Josefina Manansala Campaner.[1] His mother instilled his love for singing at an early age, encouraging him to sing along to songs from his favorite singers like Karen Carpenter and Barbra Streisand. Growing up, his parents entered him in many singing contests.[3]\\r\\nHis mother, who had been suffering from heart disease, died when he was 13 years old. Her illness had left their family deep in debt.[4] Being more than six months behind on their apartment rent and unable to sufficiently provide for the family, his father decided to move out and ask relatives to take in Pineda's siblings. To ease his father's burden, Pineda quit school and started working.\\r\\nHe spent about two years on the streets, sleeping wherever he could: in public parks, or on a narrow bench outside a friend's crowded house. He earned meager money by collecting glass bottles, newspapers, and scrap metal and selling them to recyclers. He would also go to the pier with his friends and take on odd jobs like cleaning scrap metal and docked ships. He didn't have much to eat, sometimes rationing a small package of Marie biscuit as food for two days.[5]\\r\\nIn 1982, when Pineda was 15 years old, he became the lead singer of the Filipino group Ijos. He used to sing in a Shakey's Pizza Parlor on Taft Street in Manila. In 1986, some members of Ijos formed a group called Amo. Amo entered and won the Rock Wars contest in the Philippines.[6]\\r\\nIn 1988, Amo entered and won the Philippines leg of the Yamaha World Band Explosion. They went on to the finals in Hong Kong, but were not qualified to win due to a technicality. The rules stated the winning song had to be an original composition. However, they also stated that the song entry in the finals had to be the same song with which the band won their country's leg of the competition. Amo's winning song in the Philippines was Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". After the contest, the band continued as Amo, performing live. They opened for Robert Palmer in Manila in 1989.[6] Amo played in clubs in Quezon City, Olongapo City and Makati City, which are located in Luzon, the biggest island in the Philippines. Amo was very popular in the Chinese-owned California Jam club in Olongapo City, which was frequented by United States military personnel.[6]\\r\\nIn 1990, Pineda and other members of Amo formed another band called Intensity Five and once again entered the Yamaha World Band Explosion. Pineda won the Best Vocalist award and the band came in as first runner up.[6]\\r\\nLater in 1990, five of Amo's original members split from the band leader, Ulysis Ablang and formed another band behind Pineda, New Age. This occurred prior to the release of Amo's only album released in 1990 titled Ang Tunay na Amo (\\"The Real Master\\") on BMG records which spawned one popular radio hit called \\"Running Away\\". (The song gained recognition in 2006 by another Filipino artist Erik Santos, who won a Filipino TV talent show, Star In A Million.) The remaining members of Amo went on to become The Boss Band, while Pineda's band, New Age, played regularly at Fire and Rain in Makati City.\\r\\nIn 1991, during one of those performances, a talent agent spotted Pineda and New Age and asked them to move to Hong Kong to perform at a very popular entertainment restaurant called Grammy's. With New Age, Pineda performed six nights a week, Tuesday through to Sunday, for several years thereafter.[6] After a long-term serious relationship failed in 1994, Pineda suffered health problems, which almost destroyed his voice. He then returned to the Philippines. After six months of recuperation, he was able to sing again.[6][7] He returned to Hong Kong and resumed singing with his band. In 1998, the owner of Igor's, a horror-themed restaurant/nightclub in Hong Kong, asked New Age to perform there. Dressed in skeleton outfits, they called themselves The Rolling Bones.[6]\\r\\nIn 1999, Pineda caught the attention of Warner Bros. record label and flew back to the Philippines on his days off to record a solo album, the self-titled Arnel Pineda. Most of the album's ten original songs were slow ballads, with only two upbeat numbers, one of which carries a Latin style. One of the songs, \\"Iiyak Ka Rin\\" (\\"You Will Cry Too\\") became a karaoke favorite in Asia, while another song \\"Sayang\\" (\\"Too Bad\\") became a radio favorite. Pineda wrote and arranged several songs. He continued to perform with New Age while making his album and for several years thereafter. In 2001, Pineda sang one song, \\"Looking Glass\\", with Filipino band South Border on their album The Way We Do. Earlier that year, Pineda formed a new band, eventually called 9mm, and played around the city's top bars including The Hard Rock Cafe in Makati City. The band played a three-month stint at The Edge in Lan Kwai Fong, Hong Kong, in 2002.\\r\\nIn 2004, three members of New Age reformed with a female singer sharing lead vocals with Pineda and called themselves Most W@nted. This band played 3ÿ4 hour sets Monday through Saturday at The Cavern Club in Hong Kong.[8] On their only day off, Sunday, the band often performed at Filipino community events.\\r\\nIn 2005, Pineda recorded the theme song of the short-lived Filipino radio show Dayo. A band named The Visitors was briefly formed for promotion purposes of the Dayo soundtrack consisting of three members from Ijos/Yjoz, Amo, New Age and Most W@nted.[6]\\r\\nIn 2006, encouraged by well-respected Filipino talent manager and TV director Bert de Leon, Pineda moved back to the Philippines with Monet Cajipe, the guitarist who had been in all of Pineda's previous bands. They formed The Zoo with Emil Bondoc on bass, Edgar Mendoza on keyboards, and Mckoy Alcantara on drums. They signed on with de Leon's company, Sundance Entertainment Corporation. The Zoo performed several nights a week at clubs in Manila and Olongapo during 2006 and 2007. Shows regularly spanned 3ÿ5 hours. The Zoos first album Zoology was released by MCA Universal in September 2007 featuring 12 original tracks and one cover song (\\"Pain in My Heart\\" was originally recorded a decade earlier by Second Wind), five of which were penned by Pineda, and another was co-written by Pineda and Mark Valliente.[9][10]\\r\\nVideos of The Zoo performing cover songs by Journey, Survivor, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Air Supply, The Eagles, Kenny Loggins, Stryper and other popular acts from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, began appearing on YouTube in February 2007. On June 28, 2007, Neal Schon of Journey contacted Noel Gomez, a longtime fan and friend of Pineda who had uploaded many of these videos, to ask for Pineda's contact information.[11] Schon sent an e-mail to Pineda inviting him to audition for Journey. Pineda initially dismissed the e-mail as a hoax, but after being persuaded by Gomez, he finally replied to Schon's e-mail. Ten minutes later, Pineda received a phone call from Schon.[12] On August 12,[13] Pineda, along with his manager Bert de Leon, flew to Marin County, just north of San Francisco, for a two-day audition.[14][15] The star-struck Pineda was welcomed warmly but he described the audition as \\"nerve-wracking, tense\\".[16] On December 5, 2007, Pineda was announced as the new lead singer of Journey.[17]\\r\\nPineda debuted as the lead singer of Journey on February 21, 2008 at the Vi?a del Mar International Song Festival held at the Quinta Vergara Amphitheater in Vi?a del Mar, Chile.[18][19]\\r\\nChilean media acclaimed Pineda's performance (translated to English): \\"The new vocalist fits very well with the band, his vocal aptitudes shining through, which are very similar to the legendary musician of the band, Steve Perry.\\"[20] Journey keyboardist/guitarist Jonathan Cain described Pineda's performance in a radio interview: \\"We went to Chile just recently, where we had never played and they went crazy, they absolutely went nuts...Arnel's first show? talk about a stressful thing? we had a televised concert for 25 million people...Is the guy a winner? Yeah, he's a winner. He's a clutch player.\\"[21]\\r\\nJourney returned to the United States for a private RE/MAX Convention event at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada, on March 6, 2008, then performed at Las Vegas' Planet Hollywood on March 8, 2008 (this concert was recorded and used, in part, for the Revelation DVD).\\r\\nOn February 1, 2009, he performed with Journey at the Super Bowl XLIII pregame show.\\r\\nJourney's first album with Pineda, Revelation, debuted at No. 5 in the Billboard Top 200 album charts in the week following its release (released June 3, 2008), and remained in the Top 20 for six weeks. It was certified gold by the RIAA with more than 336,000 units sold within the first few days.[22] It achieved platinum status by October 1, 2009.\\r\\nThe US version of the album (distributed exclusively through Wal-Mart) consists of ten new songs (\\"Faith in the Heartland\\" was co-written and originally recorded by vocalist Steve Augeri and S. Augeri is credited as songwriter in the liner notes of this album) and 12 re-recorded classics, plus a live in-concert DVD filmed during the March 8, 2008 concert in Las Vegas. The European version distributed through Frontiers Records contains 11 new songs, 11 re-recorded classics, plus one new bonus track, but does not include the DVD. All of the music on Revelation was produced by Kevin Shirley (who previously worked with Journey on their Platinum-certified Trial by Fire album).[23]\\r\\nJonathan Cain described the album in an interview:\\r\\nWe recorded our greatest hits with our brand new singer from the Philippines, Arnel Pineda, and it's unbelievable when you listen to it. We paid a lot of attention to the details because everybody loves those hits and we weren't about to step all over it...We're excited because we think Arnel is the future for our franchise...We knew that if we were ever gonna move on, we had to get somebody that was really gonna be our future and sound like Journey is supposed to sound...I think Journey fans are in for a real treat.[21]\\r\\nIn an interview soon after Pineda joined the band, Neal Schon said:\\r\\nWe feel reborn. I think theres a lot of chemistry among the five of us. At first we were going to go into the studio and just write 4 songs, but now its escalated to a lot of great new and diverse material. The stuff sounds tremendous. Everyones so stoked about it. We feel very fortunate to have found Arnel.[24]\\r\\nJourney's 2008 tour accompanying the release of Revelation began on June 8, 2008, in Spain, followed by four dates in Germany, and one date in the Netherlands. Journey toured the United Kingdom and Ireland from June 17 through June 28, 2008. The US tour (with Heart and Cheap Trick) began on July 9, 2008, in Denver, Colorado, and continued through October 4, 2008, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Many dates were already sold out well in advance. Pineda celebrated his 41st birthday on September 5, 2008, during a concert at the Molson Amphitheater in Toronto, Ontario. In September 2008, Journey performed back-to-back sold-out concerts at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles.[25] Pineda sang in 57 concerts during the 2008 Journey World Tour. Journey's recent visit to the United States Gulf Coast performing at the Wharf Amphitheater, Orange Beach, Alabama, and at the Pensacola Civic Center, Pensacola, Florida, was a tremendous hit due to the large Filipino communities living in that area.\\r\\nOn the second leg of the tour, Journey went on an AsianÿHawaiian tour, going to cities in Japan, the Philippines, China and Hawaii.[26] The Manila concert was released as a live concert DVD. Total concert revenue for Journey in 2008 was $35,695,481.[27]\\r\\nPineda married Cherry Pineda in 2001. They have a son named Cherub and daughter, Thea Chenelle Pineda, born June 15, 2012.[28] Pineda also has two older sons, Matthew and Angelo, from past relationships.[29]\\r\\nFrontiers Records (Europe)\\r\\nUniversal Music Group (rest of Asia)","input":"Who is the current lead singer for journey?"},{"output":"Isaac Newton","context":"","input":"Who is credited with developing the scientific method?"},{"output":"lifetime tenure","context":"","input":"What is the term for supreme court judges?"},{"output":"area along Long Island's Atlantic Ocean shoreline","context":"The South Shore of Long Island, in the U.S. state of New York, is the area along Long Island's Atlantic Ocean shoreline.

It is often used as a generic name for the entire southern half of Long Island rather than just the area immediately adjacent to the coastline.[1]\\r\\nThe South Shore tends to be diverse in culture and income as it varies from one hamlet or village to another.

The South Shore is also home to the world-renowned seaside resort of The Hamptons on its east end, located on the South Fork of Long Island.[2] On its west end, bordering Queens, the Five Towns retains pockets of affluence similar in character to the Gold Coast of the North Shore and The Hamptons.\\r\\nIn approximate west to east order:","input":"What is the south shore of long island?"},{"output":"Aruba","context":"","input":"What countries have dutch as their official language?"},{"output":"around 75 minutes","context":"The Tesla Supercharger network is a system of 480-volt DC fast-charging stations built by American vehicle manufacturer Tesla Inc. to allow longer journeys for their all-electric manufactured vehicles (Model S, 3 and X), through quick charging of the vehicle's battery packs.\\r\\nTesla began building the network in 2012. As of December 2017[update], there were 1,045 stations globally, with 7,496 chargers.[1] The Supercharger is a proprietary direct current (DC) technology that provides up to 120?kW of power per car (depending on circumstances),[2] giving the 90 kWh Model S an additional 170 miles (270?km) of range in about 30 minutes charge and a full charge in around 75 minutes.[1] A software update provided in 2015 to all Tesla cars uses demand information from each Supercharger station to plan the fastest route, if charging will be necessary to reach the destination.[3]\\r\\nTesla has taken several measures to discourage drivers from using Superchargers for longer than necessary. In December 2016, Tesla started fining owners who remain plugged into a Supercharger after the car is fully charged. A year later, Tesla banned commercial, ride-sharing, taxicab, or government vehicles from using Superchargers. Additionally, owners of vehicles purchased after January 15, 2017, were given an annual limit of 400 kWh (about 1,000 miles or 1,600?km) of free charging \\"credit\\" before they have to pay for charging.\\r\\nAs of April 2017[update], Tesla plans to expand from approximately 9,000 destination charging stations to 15,000 during 2017, in advance of the Model 3 rollout which they expect to put significant additional demand for use of the facilities.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla supercharging stations charge with up to 145?kW of power distributed between two cars with a maximum of 120?kW per car.[12][5][13] They take about 20 minutes to charge to 50%, 40 minutes to charge to 80%, and 75 minutes to 100% on the original 85 kwh Model S. The charging stations provide high-power direct-current (DC) charging power directly to the battery, bypassing the internal charging power supply.[1] The next version of Supercharging is expected to charge with more than 350?kW.[14][15]\\r\\nA few of the Tesla supercharging stations use solar panels to offset energy use and provide shade.[16] In the next few years after 2016, Tesla plans to install additional solar power generation at superchargers. For Model S and X vehicles ordered through January 2017, the cost for using the superchargers for the life of the car is covered with the purchase of the car. As of January 2017, the network is exclusive to Model S and Model X. Supercharging hardware is standard on Model S vehicles equipped with a battery of 70 kWh or greater, and optional (with a one-time payment of US$2,000) on Model S vehicles equipped with a 60 kWh battery. The Roadster is not equipped to charge from the Superchargers, but all future Tesla cars will include the ability.[17][18][19] In May 2017, Tesla announced that existing Tesla owners can give free Supercharging to up to five friends if they use their referral code, and all existing Tesla owners who purchase a new Model S or Model X will receive free Supercharging on those cars.[20]\\r\\nIn the European market, Tesla uses the standardized IEC 62196 Type 2 connector for its cars and Superchargers.[21] This results in an incompatibility with imported US Tesla cars. As of 2017, Tesla is the only automaker which offers direct current (DC) charging based on the IEC 62196-2 specification. Other manufacturers use the IEC 62196-3 Combined Charging System (CCS) charging standard.[22]\\r\\nTesla has indicated on multiple occasions that they were interested in having discussions with other auto manufacturers about sharing the Supercharger network, however no agreements have been completed or made public to date.[23][24]\\r\\nIn 2016, Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom) ruled that Tesla Superchargers are the highest power chargers available in the UK, turning down a complaint by Ecotricity. Although the Superchargers are technically capable of 145?kW, Tesla cars restrict the power to 120?kW. The Chinese GB/T standard has a maximum of 180?kW, but no cars can receive that.[12][5]\\r\\nTesla Supercharger stations allow Tesla vehicles to be fast-charged at the network within an hour. In October 2014, there were 119 standard Tesla Supercharger stations operating in the United States, 76 in Europe, and 26 in Asia.[1] On 31 March 2016, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the number of Supercharger stations would be doubled (from 613 stations with 3,628 chargers) by 2017.[26] As of November?2017[update], Tesla operates 7,320 superchargers in 1,063 stations worldwide;[1] these included 443 stations in the U.S., 31 in Canada, 6 in Mexico, 353 in Europe, and 230 in the Asia/Pacific region.[27]\\r\\nThe number of Supercharger stations grew to 280 by the end of 2014; 584 by the end of 2015; 623 as of April 2016; and about 875 expected by the end of 2016.[1] By December 2017, there were 1,045 Supercharger Locations worldwide.[28] By December 2014, two stations were solar powered.[29][16] A solar-assisted Supercharger was opened in Belgium in 2017.[30]\\r\\nThe average number of Teslas per Supercharger was 34 in 2016.[31][32] Cost estimates range from US$100,000 in 2013[33] to US$270,000 in 2015, depending on circumstances.[34] Tesla estimates that stations last 12 years.[35] Most charging occurs at home or work, a situation that Tesla has compared to cell phone charging.[36] As of 2014[update], less than 10% of charging came from superchargers.[37]\\r\\nMost Superchargers are owned by Tesla, but some are owned by fleet operators to charge their Tesla cars, such as taxis. These chargers are limited to 60?kW.[38] In December 2017, Tesla changed its terms of service so that any vehicles being used as taxis or for commercial, ride-share, or government purposes were effectively banned from using superchargers. This ban only applies to vehicles bought after December 15, 2017. Other charging options would be provided for these vehicles.[28][39]\\r\\nSupercharging is free for all Model S and Model X cars that were ordered before January 15, 2017[40] or for vehicles that were purchased using a referral code.[41] Model S and Model X cars that were ordered after January 15, 2017, are limited to free 400 kWh (about 1,000 miles or 1,600?km) per year.[42] Beyond that, supercharging will have a fee, but at a lower price than filling up a gas-powered car.[43] Since December 16, 2016, any car that remains connected to a Supercharger after being fully charged is fined US$0.40 per minute. This fee is waived if the car is removed in five minutes. Any incurred fees could be paid at the next service visit.[44]\\r\\nThere were eight initial Supercharger stations[45][46] around the United States, located at strategic points on the Boston-to-Washington and Los Angeles-to-San Francisco highway corridors. By mid-July 2013, 15 were open across the United States, with the number expected to nearly double by the end of the summer.[47] The stations were developed and mass constructed in cooperation with Black & Veatch.[48] Supercharging stations were available in Canada along the Highway 401 corridor between Toronto and Montreal by 2014.[49]\\r\\nThe initial network was built in high-traffic corridors across North America, followed by networks in Europe and Asia in the second half of 2013. The first Supercharger corridor in the US opened with free access in October 2012. This corridor included six stations placed along routes connecting San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.[17][18] A second corridor was opened in December 2012 along the Northeast megalopolis, connecting Washington, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City and Boston; it includes three stations in highway rest areas, one in Delaware and two adjacent ones in Connecticut.[19] At some stations, the electricity is paid by a local business to attract customers.[50]\\r\\nThe electricity used by the Supercharger (277V L-N of a 480Y/277V 3-phase configuration) in the West Coast corridor comes partly from a solar carport system[clarification needed] provided by SolarCity.[citation needed] Eventually, all Supercharger stations are to be supplied by solar power. According to Musk, \\"...we expect all of the United States to be covered by the end of next year [2013]\\". He also said that Tesla owners' use of the network would be free forever.[51]\\r\\nAs of August?2017[update] North Dakota, Alaska, and Hawaii are the few remaining states without Superchargers. Supercharging stations are planned to be opened later in 2017 in North Dakota and Hawaii,[52] but there are no current plans to add one in Alaska.[53] In September 2017, Tesla started adopting a new strategy of installing \\"Urban Superchargers\\" in the centers of major cities in anticipation of the mass production of the Tesla Model 3.[54][55] The first Urban Supercharger stations were a 10-unit charger in Chicago and an 8-unit charger in Boston.[56]\\r\\nIn early 2015, the first European supercharger to be upgraded with a 'solar canopy' (a carport with solar cells on the roof) in K?ge, Denmark.[citation needed] According to the person responsible for Tesla's superchargers in the Nordic countries, Christian Marcus, the 12-stall supercharger in K?ge has 300 m2 solar cells with a projected annual production of about 40 MWh and is or will be equipped with its own battery bank for temporary storage of excess production. Unlike other European Supercharger stations, Tesla has bought the land on which the K?ge supercharger stands.[57] On April 26, 2016, Kostom?oty became the first charger to open in Poland.[58] There are a few privately operated Supercharger stations such as the one opened on April 27, 2016, in Zarechye, Russia, with 3 stalls and also one in Jordan.[59]\\r\\nBy 2016, the European supercharger network is planned to allow a Model S to drive from the North Cape in Norway to Istanbul or Lisbon.[57] As of October 2017[update], the supercharger closest to Istanbul is the one in Vrgorac (Croatia), and the ones nearest to Lisbon are Montemor-o-Novo and Ftima.[52] The map of current and planned sites includes every European Union country except Malta and Cyprus, and represents all of the countries in the world in the top 10 of electric vehicle adoption rates (excepting, Iceland at #2).[52]\\r\\nAs of June?2015[update], Hong Kong has the highest density of Tesla superchargers in the world, with eight stations with a total of 54 supercharger stalls, allowing most Model S owners to have a supercharger within 20 minutes' drive.[60] Other Superchargers can also be found in Australia, the People's Republic of China,[61] Japan, Macau, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan.[1]\\r\\nTesla also plans to deploy a nationwide network of Superchargers in India.[62][63]\\r\\nA \\"Tesla station\\" was a planned second version of the supercharger[65] that, as of 2013, would provide Tesla owners with extremely-fast battery pack swaps as well fast-recharge for Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles.[66][67] The company's plans changed and battery swapping is no longer a significant part of Tesla's charging infrastructure plans.\\r\\nBy December 2014, 18 months after the announcement, no battery swapping stations had yet opened to the public.[29] That same month, the company announced a revision to their much-delayed[29][68] plans. A single battery-swap station would be opened in California as a pilot project, where only invited Model S owners could do battery swaps by appointment, to assess technical and economic aspects of the service. Demand for the priced servicewhich was expected to take three minutes (instead of the 90-second time demonstrated in 2013)would be used to determine whether the company would fully commercialize battery swapping stations more generally.[69] The original plan in the June 2013 company announcement explicitly indicated that the company would eventually upgrade all existing Tesla Supercharger stations to become Tesla stations, which would offer the battery-pack swap for the Model S in addition to the fast recharge capability that each facility initially opened with.[67] By June 2015, the company had indicated that battery swapping capabilities was no longer a significant part of Tesla's plans for on-road energy replacement for their vehicles.[70]\\r\\nIn June 2013, Tesla announced the goal to deploy a battery swapping station in each of its existing supercharging stations, now to be renamed Tesla stations.[65] At an event at Tesla's design studio in Los Angeles, CEO Elon Musk demonstrated a battery swap operation with the Tesla Model S, which took just over 90 seconds each for the two cars participating in the demo. The swapping operation took less than half the time needed to refill a gasoline-powered car used for comparison purposes during the event.[71][72] The Tesla Model S was designed from the beginning to support fast battery swapping,[65][73] with Tesla publicly discussing the capability as early as March 2009.[74]\\r\\nBy December 2014, no battery-swapping stations had been opened to the public.[29] On 19 December, Tesla announced revised plans. They would now build only a single battery-swapping station, and institute a \\"Battery Swap Pilot Program\\" at that selected station in Harris Ranch, California in order to \\"assess demand.\\" Only invited Model S owners would be able to participate in the pilot battery swaps. The company stated they would \\"evaluate relative demand from customers ... to assess whether it merits the engineering resources and investment necessary\\" for the upgrade of additional first-generation Supercharger stations.[69]\\r\\nIn June 2015, Tesla announced that of 200 invitations sent out to try the pilot pack swap station, only approximately five tried it. Tesla then invited all California Model S owners to try it out, but expected a low usage rate.[70] A survey showed that most users were not interested.[75]\\r\\nThe first Tesla Station with battery-swapping capability was planned to be piloted in California late in 2013,[76] but this was subsequently delayed. Elon Musk said at an event in February 2014 that a few battery swap stations will open in the next few months along the route between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and that the initial stations will be studied before deciding to build any more.[77] In mid-2013 each swapping station was projected to cost US$500,000 and have approximately 50 batteries available without requiring reservations.[71]\\r\\nElon Musk said the battery swapping service would be offered for the price of about 15 US gallons (57?l; 12?imp?gal) of gasoline at the current local rate, around US$60 to US$80 at June 2013 prices. Owners may pick up their own battery pack fully charged on the return trip for no extra payment. Tesla will also offer the option to keep the pack received on the swap and pay the price difference if the battery received is newer; or to receive the original pack back from Tesla for a transport fee. The billing will be handled via customer credit card on file with Tesla. Pricing had not been determined as of June?2013[update].[71]\\r\\nThe California Air Resources Board staff considered modifying the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regulation to exclude battery swapping as a \\"fast refueling\\" technology; this change would deny Tesla some of the ZEV credits that the manufacturer might otherwise receive when the battery-swapping station is placed in service in California.[72] After criticism from several motoring manufacturers, this proposal was withdrawn.[78]\\r\\nTesla announced a higher-capacity \\"Megacharger\\" along with the unveiling of a prototype for its Tesla Semi, a semi-trailer truck, in November 2017. These trucks would use the Tesla Megacharger Network to charge. The solar-powered Megacharger Network stations would charge the semi trucks with 400 miles (645 km) of charge in 30 minutes, out of the total capacity of 500 miles (805?km) in the battery pack.[79][80][81][82] To accomplish this, it will likely have an output level over one megawatt.[80]","input":"How long does it take to charge a tesla at supercharger?"},{"output":"1,281,900","context":"American Revolutionary War\\r\\nWhiskey Rebellion\\r\\nIndian Wars\\r\\nBarbary Wars\\r\\nWar of 1812\\r\\nPatriot War\\r\\nMexicanÿAmerican War\\r\\nUtah War\\r\\nCortina Troubles\\r\\nReform War\\r\\nAmerican Civil War\\r\\nLas Cuevas War\\r\\nSpanishÿAmerican War\\r\\nBanana Wars\\r\\nPhilippineÿAmerican War\\r\\nBoxer Rebellion\\r\\nBorder War\\r\\nWorld War I\\r\\nRussian Civil War\\r\\nWorld War II\\r\\nCold War\\r\\nPersian Gulf War\\r\\nSomali Civil War\\r\\nBosnian War\\r\\nKosovo War\\r\\nGlobal War on Terrorism\\r\\nMilitary deployment after Hurricane Katrina\\r\\nPakistanÿUnited States skirmishes\\r\\nIntervention against ISIL\\r\\nArmy\\r\\nArmy officer\\r\\nArmy warrant officer\\r\\nArmy enlisted\\r\\nMarine Corps\\r\\nMarine Corps officer\\r\\nMarine Corps warrant officer\\r\\nMarine Corps enlisted\\r\\nNavy\\r\\nNavy officer\\r\\nNavy warrant officer\\r\\nNavy enlisted\\r\\nAir Force\\r\\nAir Force officer\\r\\nAir Force enlisted\\r\\nCoast Guard\\r\\nCoast Guard officer\\r\\nCoast Guard warrant officer\\r\\nThe United States Armed Forces[6] is the armed forces of the United States of America. It consists of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard.[7] The President of the United States is the U.S. Armed Forces's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), both federal executive departments, acting as the principal organs by which military policy is carried out. All five armed services are among the seven uniformed services of the United States.[8]\\r\\nFrom the time of its inception, the U.S. Armed Forces played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the founders of the United States were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played a critical role in the American Civil War, continuing to serve as the armed forces of the Union (American Civil War), although a number of its officers resigned to join the military of the Confederate States. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War?II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged the previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force (within the Defense Department) and the National Security Council.\\r\\nThe U.S. Armed Forces is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel. It draws its personnel from a large pool of paid volunteers; although conscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972, but the Selective Service System has 17 million males on record with the Selective Service.[9] As of 2016, the U.S. spends about $580.3 billion annually to fund its military forces and Overseas Contingency Operations.[4] Put together, the U.S. constitutes roughly 40 percent of the world's military expenditures. For the period 2010ÿ14, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) found that the U.S. was the world's largest exporter of major arms, accounting for 31 percent of global shares. The U.S. was also the world's eighth largest importer of major weapons for the same period.[10] The U.S. Armed Forces has significant capabilities in both defense and power projection due to its large budget, resulting in advanced and powerful equipment, and its widespread deployment of force around the world, including about 800 military bases in foreign locations.[11] Added to this, the largest air force in the world is the U.S. Air Force. Moreover, the worlds second largest air arm is the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps combined.[12] The U.S. Navy is the largest navy by tonnage.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the U.S. Armed Forces dates to 1775, even before the Declaration of Independence marked the establishment of the United States. The Continental Army, Continental Navy, and Continental Marines were created in close succession by the Second Continental Congress in order to defend the new nation against the British Empire in the American Revolutionary War.\\r\\nThese forces demobilized in 1784 after the Treaty of Paris ended the War for Independence. The Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, and the United States Congress created the United States Navy on 27 March 1794, and the United States Marine Corps on 11 July 1798. All three services trace their origins to the founding of the Continental Army (on 14 June 1775), the Continental Navy (on 13 October 1775) and the Continental Marines (on 10 November 1775), respectively. The 1787 adoption of the Constitution gave the Congress the power to \\"raise and support armies\\", \\"provide and maintain a navy\\", and to \\"make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces\\", as well as the power to declare war. The President of the United States is the U.S. Armed Forces' commander-in-chief.\\r\\nRising tensions at various times with Britain and France and the ensuing Quasi-War and War of 1812 quickened the development of the U.S. Navy (established 13 October 1775) and the United States Marine Corps (established 10 November 1775). The U.S. Coast Guard dates its origin to the founding of the Revenue Cutter Service on 4 August 1790; that service merged with the United States Life-Saving Service in 1915 to establish the Coast Guard. The United States Air Force was established as an independent service on 18 September 1947; it traces its origin to the formation of the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, formed 1 August 1907, and was part of the Army before becoming an independent service.\\r\\nThe reserve component formed a military strategic reserve during the Cold War, to be called into service in case of war.[14][15][16] Time magazine's Mark Thompson has suggested that with the War on Terror, the reserves deployed as a single force with the active component and America no longer has a strategic reserve.[17][18][19]\\r\\nCommand over the U.S. Armed Forces is established in the United States Constitution. The sole power of command is vested in the President by Article II as Commander-in-Chief. The Constitution also allows for the creation of \\"executive Departments\\" headed by \\"principal officers\\" whose opinion the President can require. This allowance in the Constitution formed the basis for creation of the Department of Defense in 1947 by the National Security Act. The Defense Department is headed by the Secretary of Defense, who is a civilian and member of the Cabinet. The Defense Secretary is second in the Armed Forces' chain of command(with the exception of the Coast Guard, which is under the Secretary of Homeland Security), just below the President, and serves as the principal assistant to the President in all defense-related matters.[20] Together, the President and the Secretary of Defense comprise the National Command Authority, which by law, is the ultimate lawful source of military orders.[21]\\r\\nTo coordinate military strategy with political affairs, the President has a National Security Council headed by the National Security Advisor. The collective body has only advisory power to the President, but several of the members who statutorily comprise the council (the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of Defense) possess executive authority over their own departments.[22]\\r\\nJust as the President and the Secretary of Defense are in charge of the entire military establishment, maintaining civilian control of the military, so too are each of the Defense Department's constitutive military departments headed by civilians. The four DoD branches are organized into three departments, each with civilian heads. The Department of the Army is headed by the Secretary of the Army, the Department of the Navy is headed by the Secretary of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force is headed by the Secretary of the Air Force. The Marine Corps is organized under the Department of the Navy. The Coast Guard is not under the administration of the Defense Department, but the Department of Homeland Security and receives its operational orders from the Secretary of Homeland Security. However, the Coast Guard may be transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during a time of war, thereby placing it within the Defense Department.[23]\\r\\nThe President, Secretary of Defense, and other senior executive officials are advised by a seven-member Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is headed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest-ranking officer in the United States military, and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[24] The rest of the body is composed of the heads of each of the Defense Department's service branches (the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force) as well as the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. Although commanding one of the five military branches, the Commandant of the Coast Guard is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Despite being composed of the highest-ranking officers in each of the respective branches, the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not possess operational command authority. Rather, the Goldwater-Nichols Act charges them only with advisory power.[25]\\r\\nAll of the branches work together during operations and joint missions in Unified Combatant Commands, under the authority of the Secretary of Defense with the exception of the Coast Guard. Each of the Unified Combatant Commands is headed by a Combatant Commander, a senior commissioned officer who exercises supreme command authority per 10 U.S.C.??164 over all of the forces, regardless of branch, within his geographical or functional command. By statute, the chain of command flows from the President to the Secretary of Defense to each of the Combatant Commanders.[26] In practice, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff often acts as an intermediary between the Secretary of Defense and the Combatant Commanders.\\r\\nThe United States has the world's largest military budget. In the fiscal year 2016, $580.3 billion in funding were enacted for the Department of Defense (DoD) and for \\"Overseas Contingency Operations\\" in the War on Terrorism.[4] Outside of direct DoD spending, the United States spends another $218 to $262?billion each year on other defense-related programs, such as Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, nuclear weapons maintenance, and the State Department.\\r\\nBy service, $146.9?billion was allocated for the Army, $168.8?billion for the Navy and Marine Corps, $161.8?billion for the Air Force and $102.8?billion for defense-wide spending.[4] By function, $138.6?billion was requested for personnel, $244.4?billion for operations and maintenance, $118.9?billion for procurement, $69.0?billion for research and development, $1.3?billion for revolving and management funds, $6.9?billion for military construction, and $1.3?billion for family housing.[4]\\r\\nIn FY 2009, major defense programs saw continued funding:\\r\\nLoren Thompson, a defense analyst with the Lexington Institute, has blamed the \\"vast sums of money\\" squandered on cutting-edge technology projects that were then canceled on shortsighted political operatives who lack a long-term perspective in setting requirements. The result is that the number of items bought under a given program are cut. The total development costs of the program are divided over fewer platforms, making the per-unit cost seem higher and so the numbers are cut again and again in a death spiral.[27] Although the United States was the world's biggest exporter of major weapons in 2010ÿ14, the US was also the world's eight biggest importer during the same period. US arms imports increased by 21 percent between 2005ÿ2009 and 2010ÿ14.[10]\\r\\nCost containment measures in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration's energy policy will play critical determining roles because health care and fuel costs are the two fastest-growing segments of the defense budget.[28][29]\\r\\nThe projected active duty end strength in the armed forces for FY 2017 was 1,281,900 people,[4] with an additional 801,200 people in the seven reserve components.[4] It is an all-volunteer military, but conscription through the Selective Service System can be enacted at the President's request and Congress' approval. All males ages 18 through 25 who are living in the United States are required to register with the Selective Service for a potential future draft.\\r\\nThe U.S. Armed Forces is the world's second largest after China's People's Liberation Army, and has troops deployed around the globe.\\r\\nFrom 1776 until September 2012, a total of 40 million people have served in the United States Armed Forces.[30]\\r\\nThe FY 2017 DoD budget request[4] plan calls for an active duty end strength of 1,281,900, a decrease of 19,400 from the 2016 baseline as a result of decrements in the Army (15,000 fewer personnel) and Navy (4,400 fewer personnel) strength. The budget request also calls for a reserve component end strength of 801,200, a decrease of 9,800 personnel.\\r\\nAs in most militaries, members of the U.S. Armed Forces hold a rank, either that of officer, warrant officer, or enlisted, to determine seniority and eligibility for promotion. Those who have served are known as veterans. Rank names may be different between services, but they are matched to each other by their corresponding paygrade.[31] Officers who hold the same rank or paygrade are distinguished by their date of rank to determine seniority, while officers who serve in certain positions of office of importance set by law, outrank all other officers in active duty of the same rank and paygrade, regardless of their date of rank.[32] Currently, only one in four persons in the United States of the proper age meet the moral, academic and physical standards for military service.[33]\\r\\n2010 Demographic Reports and end strengths for reserve components.[4][34][35] (should be updated using 2011 Demographic Reports[36] and Dec.2011 DMDC military personnel data[37])\\r\\nThese numbers do not take into account the use of Private Military and Private Security Companies (PSCs). Quarterly PSC census reports are available for United States Central Command (USCENTCOM)'s area of operationsi.e., Iraq and Afghanistan.[39] As of March 2011, there were 18,971 private security contractor (PSC) personnel in Afghanistan working for DoD; in Iraq, there were 9,207 PSC personnel, down from a high of 15,279 in June 2009.[40] As of October 2012, in Afghanistan, there were 18,914 PSC personnel working for DoD; in Iraq, there were 2,116 PSC personnel.[41] The total number of DoD contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan was more than 137,400; reported PSCs were only a part of the number.\\r\\nAs of 31 December 2010, U.S. Armed Forces troops were stationed in 150 countries; the number of non-contingent deployments per country ranges from 1 in Suriname to over 50,000 in Germany.[42] Some of the largest deployments are: 103,700 in Afghanistan, 52,440 in Germany (see list), 35,688 in Japan (USFJ), 28,500 in South Korea (USFK), 9,660 in Italy, and 9,015 in the United Kingdom. These numbers change frequently due to the regular recall and deployment of units.\\r\\nAltogether, 77,917 military personnel are located in Europe, 141 in the former Soviet Union, 47,236 in East Asia and the Pacific, 3,362 in North Africa, the Near East, and South Asia, 1,355 in sub-Saharan Africa and 1,941 in the Western Hemisphere excluding the United States itself.\\r\\nIncluding U.S. territories and ships afloat within territorial waters\\r\\nAs of 31 December 2009, a total of 1,137,568 personnel were on active duty within the United States and its territories (including 84,461 afloat).[43] The vast majority (941,629 personnel) were stationed at bases within the contiguous United States. There were an additional 37,245 in Hawaii and 20,450 in Alaska; 84,461 were at sea, 2,972 in Guam, and 179 in Puerto Rico.\\r\\nProspective service members are often recruited from high school or college, the target age ranges being 18ÿ35 in the Army, 18ÿ28 in the Marine Corps, 18ÿ34 in the Navy, 18ÿ39 in the Air Force, and 18ÿ27 (up to age 32 if qualified for attending guaranteed \\"A\\" school) in the Coast Guard. With the permission of a parent or guardian, applicants can enlist at age 17 and participate in the Delayed Entry Program (DEP), in which the applicant is given the opportunity to participate in locally sponsored military activities, which can range from sports to competitions led by recruiters or other military liaisons (each recruiting station's DEP varies).\\r\\nAfter enlistment, new recruits undergo basic training (also known as \\"boot camp\\" in the Marine Corps, Navy and Coast Guard), followed by schooling in their primary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), rating, Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) at any of the numerous training facilities around the United States. Each branch conducts basic training differently. The Marine Corps send all non-infantry MOS's to an infantry skills course known as Marine Combat Training prior to their technical schools. Air Force Basic Military Training graduates attend Technical Training and are awarded their Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) at the apprentice (3) skill level. All Army recruits undergo Basic Combat Training (BCT), followed by Advanced Individual Training (AIT), with the exceptions of cavalry scouts, infantry, armor, combat engineers, and military police recruits who go to One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which combines BCT and AIT. The Navy sends its recruits to Recruit Training and then to \\"A\\" schools to earn a rating. The Coast Guard's recruits attend basic training and follow with an \\"A\\" school to earn a rating.\\r\\nInitially, recruits without higher education or college degrees will hold the pay grade of E-1, and will be elevated to E-2 usually soon after basic training. Different services have different incentive programs for enlistees, such as higher initial ranks for college credit, being an Eagle Scout, and referring friends who go on to enlist as well. Participation in DEP is one way recruits can achieve rank before their departure to basic training.\\r\\nThere are several different authorized pay grade advancement requirements in each junior-enlisted rank category (E-1 to E-3), which differ by service. Enlistees in the Army can attain the initial pay grade of E-4 (specialist) with a four-year degree, but the highest initial pay grade is usually E-3 (members of the Army Band program can expect to enter service at the grade of E-4). Promotion through the junior enlisted ranks occurs after serving for a specified number of years (which, however, can be waived by the soldier's chain of command), a specified level of technical proficiency, or maintenance of good conduct. Promotion can be denied with reason.\\r\\nWith very few exceptions, becoming a non-commissioned officer (NCO) or petty officer in the U.S. Armed Forces is accomplished by progression through the lower enlisted ranks. However, unlike promotion through the lower enlisted tier, promotion to NCO is generally competitive. NCO ranks begin at E-4 or E-5, depending upon service, and are generally attained between three and six years of service. Junior NCOs function as first-line supervisors and squad leaders, training the junior enlisted in their duties and guiding their career advancement.\\r\\nWhile considered part of the non-commissioned officer corps by law, senior non-commissioned officers (SNCOs) referred to as chief petty officers in the Navy and Coast Guard, or staff non-commissioned officers in the Marine Corps, perform duties more focused on leadership rather than technical expertise. Promotion to the SNCO ranks, E-7 through E-9 (E-6 through E-9 in the Marine Corps) is highly competitive. Personnel totals at the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 are limited by federal law to 2.5 percent and 1 percent of a service's enlisted force, respectively. SNCOs act as leaders of small units and as staff. Some SNCOs manage programs at headquarters level and a select few wield responsibility at the highest levels of the military structure. Most unit commanders have a SNCO as an enlisted advisor. All SNCOs are expected to mentor junior commissioned officers as well as the enlisted in their duty sections. The typical enlistee can expect to attain SNCO rank after 10 to 16?years of service.\\r\\nEach of the five services employs a single Senior Enlisted Advisor at departmental level. This individual is the highest ranking enlisted member within that respective service and functions as the chief advisor to the service secretary, service chief, and Congress on matters concerning the enlisted force. These individuals carry responsibilities and protocol requirements equivalent to three-star general or flag officers. They are as follows:\\r\\nAdditionally, all services except for the Air Force have an active warrant officer corps. Above the rank of warrant Officer One, these officers may also be commissioned, but usually serve in a more technical and specialized role within units. More recently though they can also serve in more traditional leadership roles associated with the more recognizable officer corps. With one notable exception (Army helicopter and fixed-wing pilots), these officers ordinarily have already been in the military often serving in senior NCO positions in the field in which they later serve as a warrant officer as a technical expert. Most Army pilots have served some enlisted time. It is also possible to enlist, complete basic training, go directly to the Warrant Officer Candidate School at Fort Rucker, Alabama, and then on to flight school.\\r\\nWarrant officers in the U.S. military garner the same customs and courtesies as commissioned officers. They may attend the officer's club, receive a command and are saluted by junior warrant officers and all enlisted service members.\\r\\nThe Air Force ceased to grant warrants in 1959 when the enlisted grades of E-8 and E-9 were created. Most non-flying duties performed by warrant officers in other services are instead performed by senior NCOs in the Air Force.\\r\\nOfficers receive a commission in one of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces through one of the following routes.\\r\\nOfficers receive a commission assigning them to the officer corps from the President with the Senate's consent. To accept this commission, all officers must take an oath of office.\\r\\nThrough their careers, officers usually will receive further training at one or a number of the many staff colleges.\\r\\nCompany grade officers in pay grades O-1 through O-3 (known as \\"junior\\" officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) function as leaders of smaller units or sections of a unit, typically with an experienced SNCO (or CPO in the Navy and Coast Guard) assistant and mentor.\\r\\nField grade officers in pay grades O-4 through O-6 (known as \\"senior\\" officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) lead significantly larger and more complex operations, with gradually more competitive promotion requirements.\\r\\nGeneral officers, (known as flag officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) serve at the highest levels and oversee major portions of the military mission.\\r\\nThese are ranks of the highest honor and responsibility in the U.S. Armed Forces, but they are almost never given during peacetime and only a very small number of officers during wartime have held a five-star rank:\\r\\nNo corresponding rank exists for the Marine Corps or the Coast Guard. As with three- and four-star ranks, Congress is the approving authority for a five-star rank confirmation.\\r\\nThe rank of General of the Armies is considered senior to General of the Army, but was never held by active duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of General of the Army. It has been held by two people: John J. Pershing who received the rank in 1919 after World War I, and George Washington who received it posthumously in 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial celebrations. Pershing, appointed to General of the Armies in active duty status for life, was still alive at the time of the first five-star appointments during World War?II, and was thereby acknowledged as superior in grade by seniority to any World War?IIÿera Generals of the Army. George Washington's appointment by Public Law 94-479 to General of the Armies of the United States was established by law as having \\"rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present\\", making him not only superior to Pershing, but superior to any grade in the Army in perpetuity.\\r\\nIn the Navy, the rank of Admiral of the Navy theoretically corresponds to that of General of the Armies, though it was never held by active-duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of Fleet Admiral. George Dewey is the only person to have ever held this rank. After the establishment of the rank of Fleet Admiral in 1944, the Department of the Navy specified that the rank of Fleet Admiral was to be junior to the rank of Admiral of the Navy. However, since Dewey died in 1917 before the establishment of the rank of Fleet Admiral, the six-star rank has not been totally confirmed.\\r\\nThe Woman's Army Auxiliary Corps was established in the United States in 1942. Women saw combat during World War II, first as nurses in the Pearl Harbor attacks on 7 December 1941. The Woman's Naval Reserve, Marine Corps Women's Reserve, and Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) were also created during this conflict. In 1944 WACs arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on D-Day. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 Navy nurses were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War Two and 16 were killed in action; in total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations and commendations. Virginia Hall, serving with the Office of Strategic Services, received the second-highest US combat award, the Distinguished Service Cross, for action behind enemy lines in France.\\r\\nAfter World War II, demobilization led to the vast majority of serving women being returned to civilian life. Law 625, The Women's Armed Services Act of 1948, was signed by President Truman, allowing women to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces in fully integrated units during peace time, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. During the Korean War of 1950ÿ1953 many women served in the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals, with women serving in Korea numbering 120,000 during the conflict. During the Vietnam War, 600 women served in the country as part of the Air Force, along with 500 members of the WAC, and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff. The Ordnance Corps began accepting female missile technicians in 1974,[45] and female crewmembers and officers were accepted into Field Artillery missile units.[46][47]\\r\\nIn 1974, the first six women naval aviators earned their wings as Navy pilots. The Congressionally mandated prohibition on women in combat places limitations on the pilots' advancement,[48] but at least two retired as captains.[49] In 1989, Capt Linda L. Bray, 29, became the first woman to command American soldiers in battle, during the invasion of Panama. The 1991 Gulf War proved to be the pivotal time for the role of women in the U.S. Armed Forces to come to the attention of the world media. There are many reports of women engaging enemy forces during the conflict.[50]\\r\\nIn the 2000s, women can serve on U.S. combat ships, including in command roles. They are permitted to serve on submarines.[51] Women can fly military aircraft and make up 2% of all pilots in the U.S. Military. In 2003, Major Kim Campbell was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for landing her combat damaged A-10 Thunderbolt II with no hydraulic control and only one functional engine after being struck by hostile fire over Baghdad.\\r\\nOn 3 December 2015, United States of America Defense Secretary, Ashton Carter, announced that all military combat jobs would become available to women.[52] This gave women access to the roughly 10% of military jobs which were previously closed off due to their combat nature.[53] The decision gave military services until January 2016 to seek exceptions to the rule if they believe that certain jobs, such as machine gunner's, should be restricted to men only.[54] These restrictions were due in part to prior studies which stated that mixed gender units are less capable in combat.[55] Physical requirements for all jobs remained unchanged, though.[55] Many women believe this will allow for them to improve their positions in the military since most high-ranking officers start in combat positions. Since women are now available to work in any position in the military, female entry into the draft has been proposed.[56]\\r\\nSergeant Leigh Ann Hester became the first woman to receive the Silver Star, the third-highest US decoration for valor, for direct participation in combat. In Afghanistan, Monica Lin Brown was presented the Silver Star for shielding wounded soldiers with her body.[57] In March 2012, the U.S. military had two women, Ann E. Dunwoody and Janet C. Wolfenbarger, with the rank of four-star general.[58][59] In 2016, Air Force General Lori Robinson became the first female officer to command a major Unified Combatant Command (USNORTHCOM) in the history of the United States Armed Forces.[60]\\r\\nUnder current Department of Defense regulation, the various components of the U.S. Armed Forces have a set order of seniority. Examples of the use of this system include the display of service flags, placement of Soldiers, Marines, Sailors, Airmen, and Coast Guardsmen in formation, etc. When the Coast Guard shall operate as part of the Department of the Navy, United States Coast Guard Academy cadets, the United States Coast Guard, and the Coast Guard Reserve shall take precedence, respectively, after United States Naval Academy midshipmen; the United States Navy; and Navy Reserve.[61]\\r\\nNote: While the U.S. Navy is older than the Marine Corps,[62] the Marine Corps takes precedence due to previous inconsistencies in the Navy's birth date. The Marine Corps has recognized its observed birth date on a more consistent basis. The Second Continental Congress is considered to have established the Navy on 13 October 1775 by authorizing the purchase of ships, but did not actually pass the \\"Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies\\" until 27 November 1775.[63] The Marine Corps was established by act of said Congress on 10 November 1775. The Navy did not officially recognize 13 October 1775 as its birth date until 1972, when thenÿChief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt authorized it to be observed as such.[62]","input":"How many service members are there in the us military?"},{"output":"Adama Lamikanra","context":"The Chief Judge of Rivers State, also known as the Chief Judge of the High Court of Justice, is the title and office of the head of the judicial branch of Rivers State.

Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake and Damian Wayne are generally the versions of Robin chosen to be portrayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor decades, Robin rarely appeared without Batman. The only exceptions have been animated stories featuring Robin as a member of the Teen Titans. Furthermore, from the 1940s to 1980s, Dick Grayson was generally portrayed as being a teenager or adult.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s Batman television series and its 1966 movie offshoot, Robin (Dick Grayson) was played by Burt Ward.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, actor Brenton Thwaites will portray Dick Grayson in the DC Comics Titans television series, depicted as the former protege of Batman who left to form his own group of heroes such as Beast Boy, Starfire, and Raven.[1] Also, the seventh episode of season one is titled \\"Jason Todd\\", it's unknown if this version will be introduced as the Red Hood already or maybe as Batman's sidekick aspirant since Grayson left.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn DC Comics related cartoon series, produced by Filmation and Hanna-Barbera throughout the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Super Friends, Robin (Dick Grayson) was voiced by Casey Kasem or Burt Ward. Both the live-action and animated versions wore the standard Robin costume, much like the film serial versions of the 1940s. He is not paired with Batman in the Cartoon Network programs Justice League and Justice League Unlimited due to the Bat-Embargo which limited the use of Batman-related characters from any media source outside of the new Batman Begins movie franchise and The Batman animated series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dick Grayson version of Robin made his first appearance during the first season of Batman: The Animated Series (1992ÿ1995), voiced by Loren Lester. He only made occasional appearances due to Bruce Timm's insistence that Batman worked best as a solo hero as already proven in the first two Burton films. The second season was known as The Adventures of Batman and Robin, as per orders of the Warner Bros. executives who wished for more frequent appearances of Robin to be made throughout the season. The Robin costume is identical to Tim Drake's Robin costume from the comics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tim Drake version of Robin appears as the second incarnation in The New Batman Adventures (1997ÿ1998). This continuity does not include Jason Todd by name, but the cartoons describe Drake as a combination of all three Robins. Versions of the Carrie Kelley (Anndi McAfee) and 1950s (Brianne Siddall) Robins, both in the original costume, also make short appearances on the show in a dream sequence from the episode \\"Legends of the Dark Knight\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Drake was voiced by Mathew Valencia in The New Batman Adventures, and by Eli Marienthal and Shane Sweet on Static Shock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cartoon Network series Teen Titans (an adaptation of the New Teen Titans comic book series) with one similarity is that the character Robin is the Teen Titan's leader. Robin joins Beast Boy, Cyborg, Raven and Starfire when Jump City is threatened by aliens in \\"Go!\\". Robin is generally respected by the others as the team's best leader, but on the inside he is driven by an unhealthy obsession to win, which sometimes alienates him from his teammates (\\"Divide And Conquer\\", \\"Masks\\", \\"Winner Take All\\", \\"The Quest\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThe identity of the series iteration of Robin (voiced by Scott Menville) isn't directly obvious, as the style of this version's costume is still closely modeled on Tim Drake's first costume as well as Robin's costume from Batman: The Animated Series, however, the colors are those of Dick Grayson and Jason Todd. Also, Robin has never been directly referred to by full name which was intentional, according to both Sam Register and Glen Murakami. The time-travel themed episode \\"How Long Is Forever?\\" showed a future where Robin has taken on the role of Nightwing (a role taken up by Dick Grayson). The episode \\"Fractured\\" shows an alternate universe version of Robin with exactly the same DNA shows up named Nosyarg Kcid (Dick Grayson spelled backwards).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many instances, Robin's relationship to Batman is heavily referenced. In \\"Go\\", just before Robin attacks a thief, bats fly at him. After a while the thief says, \\"Aren't you supposed to be with...\\" only to be interrupted by Robin who says, \\"Just moved here. I work alone now\\", and throughout the episode, he says he doesn't want to be in a team again so soon. In \\"Haunted\\", Raven uses her powers to enter Robin's mind; one of the images she sees is Robin's shadow in a cave area swearing an oath to someone, and part of a circus ring with two figures falling (taken from Dick Grayson's origin). When Robin rejects Slade in \\"Apprentice: Part 2\\" as a father figure he mentions \\"I already have a father\\", and then the screen shows a shot of a dark sky with bats flying through it, also referring to Batman. In that same episode, a battle ensues on top of a building that says \\"WAYNE ENTERPRISES\\". In \\"The Quest\\", Robin says that he was trained by the best and this is believed to be a reference to the Batman.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobin also has shown to have romantic feelings for Starfire since they first met (just like Dick Grayson). There have been romantic moments shared between the two in the series, but neither Robin nor Starfire admit their feelings for each other until the movie Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo. During the film, Robin and Starfire come very close to admitting their feelings and having their first romantic kiss, but sadly Robin proves to be too focused on the mission (and also being interrupted by Beast Boy and the others) before insisting that, as heroes, they can never be anything more. However, after the film's climax battle, Robin and Starfire finally admit their feelings for each other and share their first true romantic kiss with Cyborg commenting, \\"Well, it's about time!\\". In the end, they are both seen holding hands and finally become a romantic couple.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tie-in comic, Teen Titans Go! appears to confirm that this version of Robin is indeed Dick Grayson, as issue #47 focuses on Robin struggling through the anniversary of the death of his parents (which are shown to be the Flying Graysons, as in the episode \\"Haunted\\") with the other Titans trying to help him cope. Batman makes a cameo overseeing Titans Tower from the city, and after seeing Robin and Starfire kiss, claims that Robin is \\"in better hands\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nJason Todd is also mentioned by Beast Boy to be a potential candidate for Red X in the episode \\"X\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dick Grayson version of Robin appeared in The Batman, voiced by Evan Sabara. In this version, Dick Grayson is an energetic, gifted acrobat and one of the main attractions of Hayley's Circus, along with his parents, as part of the amazing Flying Grayson's act. His life was changed forever when Tony Zucco and his brothers tried to threaten Grayson's father into taking a \\"protection\\" policy. When the Graysons refused, an altercation resulted in the police and Batman being called. The Zuccos were easily defeated for the moment one of Tony's brothers was even captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn angered Zucco altered the rigs on the Flying Graysons trapeze act, causing Dick's parents to fall to their deaths right in front of their son during a performance. With no surviving family members, Dick was taken in by Bruce Wayne as Bruce saw shades of himself in Dick after his own parents' murder. After Dick discovered that Wayne was Batman, the two worked together to capture Zucco. Dick chose the codename \\"Robin\\" because that is what his mother had called him.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrayson sports a costume elements of Tim Drake's two Robin costumes, although an early promotional photo showed a suit with a bit more originality. His costume and equipment are also influenced heavily by his Teen Titans counterpart, however, their personalities differ massively; whereas the Teen Titans incarnation is a serious, focused and occasionally obsessive leader, this version is far less serious and genuinely enjoys his work as a vigilante, constantly spouting one-liners and generally acting in the mould of a typical teenager and his Golden Age comic counterpart. Some tension arose when Robin and Batgirl (Barbara Gordon) met. Batgirl, having been active as a vigilante and wanna-be partner of the Batman some time before Robin appeared, was quite jealous of Batman's new 'official partner'. This was changed when Batman took the liberty of revealing their identities to Batgirl and fully accepted into the fold. Afterward, Robin and Batgirl developed a more friendly, almost sibling-like working relationship. Robin even likes calling Batgirl \\"Babs\\" when they aren't in costumes, though she is not fond of the nickname.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs depicted in a possible future during the episode \\"Artifacts\\", Dick Grayson gives up the \\"Robin\\" name and costume to become Nightwing. Barbara and Batman still persist in calling him by his original codename. Batman did this more out of habit, and Barbara did it as a flirting sort of way to annoy Dick. The police department who discover the Batcave in the beginning of the episode call Robin as 'Red Robin', a reference to Kingdom Come, and they theorize that Bruce Wayne was Red Robin (with his father as Batman and his mother as Batwoman).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Krypto the Superdog episode, \\"Bathound and the Robin\\", a literal robin called \\"Robbie\\" is saved by Ace the Bathound and wants to be Ace's sidekick, much to the dismay of Ace. Robbie's costume resembled the classic outfit of Dick Grayson.\\r\\n\\r\\nDick Grayson was featured in Batman: The Brave and the Bold in the episode \\"The Color of Revenge!\\" He is depicted as the protector of Bldhaven - the city where he fights crime in the comics as Nightwing - but he is seen in the episode still as Robin. The rift between him and Batman has already taken place, and he is seen to still be angry at Batman for still treating him as a sidekick rather than a superhero in his own right. It is only after cooperating with Batman to defeat Crazy Quilt that Robin earns Batman's respect. After Crazy Quilt is defeated, Robin joins Batman when Killer Moth hijacks the Gotham Bank Money Train, but he rides in the side cart of Batman's motorcycle (something he stated he never wanted to do again). Robin was voiced by Crawford Wilson, and the teaser episode has several references to the 1960s Batman television series. Subsequently, he is seen in \\"Sidekicks Assemble!\\" where he leads fellow sidekicks Speedy and Aqualad in a battle against Ra's al Ghul. At the end of the episode, he decides to step out of the shadow of his mentor and take the costume and identity of Nightwing. He is seen as Robin once again in the teaser for \\"Emperor Joker!\\", which shows a flashback to an earlier battle between the Dynamic Duo and Firefly. In \\"The Criss Cross Conspiracy!\\", Nightwing returns and a flashback shows him as Robin. Dick eventually becomes the new Batman in the alternate future story, \\"The Knights of Tomorrow!\\", with Damian Wayne acting as the new Robin. The episode ends with Damian succeeding Dick as the new Batman after the former retires, and Damian's unnamed son (voiced by Sebastian Bader) becomes the new Robin. Damian Wayne is voiced by both Patrick Cavanaugh (as a child) and by Diedrich Bader (as an adult). Later, in the opening for \\"Triumvirate of Terror\\" Robin was seen in the team of the Justice League International playing baseball against the Legion of Doom.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobin (Dick Grayson) is one of the main cast members in the animated adaptation of Young Justice.[4] The character is voiced by actor Jesse McCartney.[5] Along with Aqualad, Kid Flash and Superboy, Robin is one of the founding members of Young Justice. However, when not on team missions, he still lives and performs his duties in Gotham City. As the most experienced member of the team, he assumed that he would automatically be the leader, but this would prove to not be the case. When in combat with Batman, their relationship is so defined that they do not need to communicate and Robin therefore assumed he could disappear and that others would immediately know what to do. Robin nominates Aqualad who accepts, saying that Robin will one day take over as he was born to lead the team. Throughout missions, Robin is shown to be the hacker of the group, making use of the computer interface on his wrist. As the youngest member of the team, he is still a bit immature and can often be heard laughing in combat as to either toy with or intimidate his opponents. He also questions the meaning of words, such as wondering why something is overwhelming, and not just \\"whelming\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn season 2, set 5 years later, Dick Grayson as Nightwing leads the team and has been replaced as Robin by Tim Drake. In Episode 8 of season 2 in the Justice League pantheon for fallen heroes we see a hologrammed computerized image of what appears to portray a second Robin with features similar to Jason Todd.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Teen Titans iteration of Robin returns in Teen Titans Go! with Scott Menville reprising his role. In the show, Robin is portrayed as the self-appointed, hard-as-nails, hubristic, slightly power mad leader of the Teen Titans but fairly more light-hearted, and has a huge crush on Starfire but is too nervous to admit this, though he is also seen as being very arrogant, often depicting himself as the so-called \\"best superhero\\", believing that he is better than his friends and heroes should always put themselves in the spotlight and take all the glory. He is also a \\"sleep-Fighter\\", and is insecure about his lack of superpowers, which has, on multiple occasions, led to one of the other Titans committing mutiny and replacing Robin as leader. In some episodes, he is shown to fall into fits of madness easily, completely ignoring his team to follow through on his own view of how to carry something out. Such examples included continuing to dig an escape tunnel despite being rescued, forcing his teammates to rely on seven numbered options and scant resources during an educational 1800s-style road trip without even the slightest bit of concern for their well-being (which ultimately leads to their deaths, which he reacts to with a lot of callousness), and thinking that nature is so dangerous he needs to be on edge and eat whatever he can find. An episode also showed that he had a backup Robin squad which features Carrie Kelly, a darker Tim Drake, and the upbeat 60s version all voiced by Scott.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn director Lambert Hillyer's 1943 film serial Batman, Robin was played by Douglas Croft. Croft was the only actor to portray Robin at the actual age of sixteen; subsequent live-action actors have either been in their early to late 20s.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRobin was played by 26-year-old Johnny Duncan in Columbia Pictures' Batman and Robin (1949), directed by Spencer Gordon Bennet.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobin did not appear in the Tim Burton movies Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992). This was an unusual move as the two 1940s serials as well as the 1966 movie and attendant TV show had presented the 'Dynamic Duo' as an inseparable pair, with the general public unaware that the comic-book incarnation of Batman often worked alone. The special edition version of the Batman (1989) DVD features an animated storyboard sequence of when Robin's parents are killed by the Joker. Jason Hillhouse provides the voice of Dick Grayson, while Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprise their respective roles (from the DC animated universe) as Batman and the Joker in the storyboard sequence. Burton planned to cast Northern Irish actor Ricky Addison Reed as Robin, but later felt it was unimportant to the story and cut Robin out altogether. In an earlier script of Batman Returns, he was portrayed as a technologically savvy street kid who would help Batman following his narrow escape when The Penguin tried to kill him. He would later play a crucial role in Batman's final confrontation with The Penguin. In that script, he was simply called Robin, has no known real name, and was to be played by Marlon Wayans.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nWayans was considered for the role of Robin in Batman Forever, but the change in directors from Burton to Joel Schumacher would also mean a change in the choice of actor for the role of Robin.[7] Chris O'Donnell played the character of Dick Grayson in the film, alongside Val Kilmer in the role of Batman. Dick Grayson's parents and older brother were murdered by Two-Face during a hostage situation at the annual Gotham Circus after the family helps get rid of a bomb rigged to explode. Bruce Wayne takes him in as his ward out of guilt for being unable to save Dick's family. Dick soon finds out that Bruce is Batman and becomes a costumed hero in his late teens. His costume closely resembles the Robin uniform worn by Tim Drake and the Robin costume from Batman: The Animated Series. However, Robin's classic costume appears as Grayson's circus uniform, sans the \\"R\\" symbol and face mask[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nO'Donnell reprised the role in the 1997 film Batman & Robin, this time opposite George Clooney as Batman. Tension between Batman and Robin is present in the film due to Robin growing tired of playing second fiddle to Batman and desiring to break free from Batman's shadow, particularly after Robin's recklessness leads to him getting frozen by Mr. Freeze. These feelings are later amplified when Poison Ivy exposes Robin to her pheromone dust and causes him to fall in love with her, sowing seeds of doubt regarding Batman's faith in his ward. In the film's climax, Robin eventually sees through Ivy's schemes and makes amends with Batman, and throughout the film, it is hinted that he harbours romantic feelings towards Alfred's niece, Barbara Wilson, who later becomes Batgirl. His costume is a blue rubber suit with a red bird symbol on the chest. He also wears a silvery Arctic version of his Robin costume.\\r\\n\\r\\nChris O'Donnell revealed to Access Hollywood that a Robin spin-off was planned but got scrapped after Batman & Robin.\\r\\n[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a June 2005 interview, Christopher Nolan, the director of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, said that as long as he was directing the franchise, Robin would not be appearing. Since Christian Bale was portraying Batman as a young man at the time of \\"Year One\\", Dick Grayson was still a child at that point.[9] Bale has also given the same opinion regarding Robin, even though his favorite Batman story, Batman: Dark Victory, focuses on Robin's origin.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the film The Dark Knight Rises, Batman finds an ally in a young policeman who goes by the name of John Blake (portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an original character created exclusively for the film. The character is Christopher Nolan's interpretation/re-imagining of the first three Robin characters in the comics.[citation needed] Like both Dick Grayson and Jason Todd, Blake is an orphan who suffered the loss of both his parents at a young age. Also like Grayson, Blake joined the GCPD, eventually being promoted to detective. Much like Todd, he is an angry young man who first met Bruce Wayne near the latter's car. And like Tim Drake, he discovers that Bruce Wayne is Batman on his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake is an orphan whose mother was killed in a car crash and whose father was murdered in a gambling related dispute when Blake was still a child. He was raised in St. Swithin's, an orphanage sponsored by the Wayne Foundation. He also develops a great admiration towards Batman. During his time there, he learned to hide his anger over his parents' death. When Bruce Wayne visited the orphanage, Blake noticed similar qualities between himself and Bruce, and single-handedly deduced that Bruce is Batman. When he was old enough, he became a police officer, and eventually befriends Batman's ally Commissioner James Gordon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the discovery of Bane, Blake confronts Bruce and attempts to convince him to return as Batman. When Bane publicly declares himself, Blake takes Gordon into hiding and arrests Selina Kyle to question her about Bruce's disappearance. He also shows his repulsion towards Gordon and Batman covering up the crimes of Harvey Dent. Blake joins Gordon and the other cops in a revolt against Bane's rule, but is caught and nearly executed. He's rescued by Batman, who tells him to evacuate the city. This attempt fails when external officers blow up the only bridge leading away from Gotham out of fear, since Bane had threatened earlier to have the bomb detonated (by a random citizen, later revealed to be Talia al Ghul, masquerading as Miranda Tate) if anyone tried to leave Gotham.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Batman apparently sacrifices himself to save the city, Blake quits the GCPD, disgusted that the mainland police were willing to let Gotham perish. He attends Bruce's funeral with Gordon, Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox. He later attends the reading of Bruce's will, and is pleasantly surprised to discover that Wayne Manor will become a home for the city's at-risk orphans, named in honor of Thomas and Martha Wayne. When he gives the name \\"Blake, John\\" to a clerk holding a package that Bruce had left him, he is told there is nothing there for him. He hands over an ID and suggests they try his legal name, which is revealed to be Robin. The clerk gives him GPS coordinates and spelunking gear, before she tells him that he should use the name \\"Robin\\" more often.

[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Suicide Squad, it is revealed Harley Quinn was an accomplice to Robin's murder, something that wasn't present in the \\"A Death in the Family\\" (1988) storyline as Quinn was not yet created.

Batman did so because he realized that he was frightening those he was trying to protect. The circumstances of his adoption are not explained. He was voiced by Shane Haboucha.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the DC Universe Animated Original Movie Batman: Under the Red Hood, an adaptation of the bestselling Batman storyline \\"Under the Hood\\" from Batman #635-650 and Batman Annual #25, Neil Patrick Harris voices Dick Grayson/Nightwing while Jensen Ackles portrays Jason Todd/Red Hood. Vincent Martella and his younger brother Alexander Martella each provide the voice of the young Jason Todd in different ages as Robin in a flashback in the beginning of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie Kelly appears as Robin in the two-part animated film Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, voiced by Ariel Winter. Being a fan of Batman, Carrie took the mantle of Robin herself when the Mutant crime organization had been wreaking havoc on Gotham. Batman comes to see her as a suitable Robin, training her and using her to gather intel. She helps him with leading the former Mutant's group Sons of Batman into learning his less violent ways, when Gotham needed martial law enforced. When Batman is called out to a duel with Superman after refusing to go back into retirement, Carrie helps Bruce fake his death. She, along with Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) and Bruce train the Sons of Batman group to begin taking on his job.\\r\\n\\r\\nJack DeSena voices Robin in the  Target exclusive 2014 direct-to-video animated feature JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, Justice League: War was released, the first of a series of films that shared the same continuity, known as the DC Animated Movie Universe. Damian Wayne and Dick Grayson appear in several of these films, Damian/Robin being voiced by Stuart Allan while Sean Maher voices Dick/Nightwing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSon of Batman, an adaptation of Grant Morrison' Batman storyline \\"Batman and Son\\", was the first time Damian Wayne had appeared in a DC-related film.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Batman vs. Robin, Damian comes into contact with the Court of Owls, being tempted to leave Batman and join him. Throughout the film, Batman and Robin fight over Damian's rawness and his lack of discipline, leading to Damian almost joining the court before Talon (voiced by Jeremy Sisto), an assassin for the Court, is ordered to kill him when the leader discovers his secret identity. After Talon massacres the entire court, he and Robin clash in the Batcave before Talon commits suicide. Afterwards, Damian leaves for a monastery in the Himalayas.\\r\\n\\r\\nDamian returns in Batman: Bad Blood, teaming up with Dick Grayson to investigate his father's disappearance. The Heretic (voiced by Travis Willingham), makes his first film appearance, as an artificially-aged clone of Damian like in the comics. Heretic attempts to absorb Damian's mind into his so he will know what it feels like to be loved, but Talia al Ghul executes him for his treachery and punishment, much to Damian's horror.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Justice League vs. Teen Titans, Batman decides to have Robin join the Teen Titans to teach him about teamwork and has Nightwing drop him off at Titans Tower. Damian ends up warming up to the team after being initially hostile towards them, forming a particular friendship with Raven.\\r\\n\\r\\nWard reprised his role as Dick Grayson/Robin in the animated movie Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders and its sequel Batman vs. Two-Face.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Cera voices Dick Grayson in The Lego Movie spin-off The Lego Batman Movie. This version was adopted by Batman as a teenager and his Robin outfit is actually a modified Reggae outfit for Batman with the pants taken off.

Charlie Schlatter voices Robin in the second and third titles. The Robin from the Lego Batman series appears in Lego Dimensions, voiced by Scott Menville. He is kidnapped early in the game's narrative, forcing Batman to find and rescue him. The game also features the Lego Batman Movie version of Robin as a playable character, with bonus story chapters adapting his role in the events of the film; using this Robin in the Teen Titans Go! world transforms him into the version of the character from that series, reprised by Scott Menville.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Batman: Arkham City, the Tim Drake version of Robin, voiced by Troy Baker, appears briefly during the story and is fully playable during the Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC. Both Robin and Dick Grayson as Nightwing are playable in the game's challenge maps.[18] Dick Grayson appears as Robin in Batman: Arkham Origins' multiplayer mode, voiced by Josh Keaton, with the ability to unlock Tim Drake's costume from Arkham City.[19] In Batman: Arkham Knight, Tim Drake returns as Robin (voiced by Matthew Mercer)[20] and Dick Grayson returns as Nightwing (voiced by Scott Porter), while Jason Todd (voiced by Troy Baker) makes his debut as a new persona called the Arkham Knight, eventually transitioning into Red Hood. \\r\\n\\r\\nDick Grayson as Nightwing appears in Injustice: Gods Among Us, voiced by Troy Baker. Damian Wayne, voiced by Neal McDonough, appears as a villainous version of Nightwing in the same game. Damian in his Robin and Nightwing personas later appeared as a playable character in the game's sequel, Injustice 2, voiced by Scott Porter.[21] Jason Todd as the Red Hood, voiced by Cameron Bowen, appears as a playable character in the game via downloadable content.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Teen Titans animated series version of Robin is a playable character in both the Game Boy Advance game and the console game adaptations; Scott Menville reprises his role from the TV series. Robin also appears as a playable character in video game adaptations of The Adventures of Batman and Robin and the films Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.\\r\\n\\r\\nLego produced a Lego Batman line of licensed sets in 2006, and a second Lego Super Heroes line in 2012. The 7783-The Batcave: The Penguin and Mr. Freeze's Invasion set features Robin in the classic costume with a mini speedboat, as well as the 2012 version 6860-The Batcave which features Robin in a red and black costume. 7785-Arkham Asylum includes Nightwing and his motorcycle as well. Set 6857-The Dynamic Duo Funhouse Escape also features the newer red and black Robin figure. It is unclear whether this Robin is reflective of the Dick Grayson Robin, because of the costume's color scheme, or the Tim Drake Robin, since Nightwing is also featured in the Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes videogame, although it has been stated on Lego.com that it is the Tim Drake incarnation. Lego has also announced a new Robin minifigure (also Tim Drake), released in the 2013 Superhero sets which has the appearance of Robin from Batman: Arkham City.[citation needed] In 2014, the Damian Wayne incarnation was released in a new set.\\r\\n\\r\\nBatman's radio series with Robin, The Batman Mystery Club, in which Batman told ghost stories, never aired. One episode was made: \\"The Monster of Dumphrey's Hall\\".[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring radio broadcasts of The Adventures of Superman radio drama Batman and Robin were paired with Superman over the years from September 15, 1945 to 1949. The pairing was pure novelty. The Batman and Robin appearances provided time off for Bud Collyer, the voice of Superman on radio. These episodes called for Superman to be occupied elsewhere and the crime fighting would be handled by Batman and Robin. On that series the voice of Robin was played by Ronald Liss.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British poet Simon Armitage wrote the poem Kid about Robin.

The President of the Indian National Congress is the elected head of the party responsible for managing the party's relationship with the general public, developing and communicating party policy especially on election platforms. The President of the All India Congress Committee, and therefore of the Indian National Congress Party (INC) as a whole, is known as the Congress President.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the party was established in 1885, 60 people have served as president. The first, Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee  presided over the first session of the Indian National Congress held at Bombay in 1885 from 28 December to 31 December. The most recently serving president is Rahul Gandhi. The president of INC at the time of India's independence was J. B. Kripalani. Annie Besant was the first woman president of INC whereas, Sarojini Naidu was the first Indian woman president. There are six members of NehruÿGandhi family who have been Congress Presidents.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1885ÿ1933, the presidency had a term of 1 year only. Traditionally, the post rotated between prominent members of the party, successive terms for the same person being frowned upon. During Jawaharlal Nehru's premiership, he rarely held the Presidency of INC, even though he was always head of the Legislative Party.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndira Gandhi however, institutionalized the practice of having the same person as the Congress President and the Prime Minister after the first Congress split of 1969. Her son Rajiv Gandhi continued that practice.\\r\\n\\r\\nNarasimha Rao too held both the Congress President and the Prime Minister's posts. Sitaram Kesri held the post after INC was voted out. But as the INC never returned to power under his leadership, he didn't hold the two posts together.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 2000ÿ09, INC did not host a conference for the first time in history. In 2004, when the INC was voted back into power, Manmohan Singh became the first Prime Minister, not to be the president of the party.

Recruits are trained in the fundamental skills necessary to be successful in an Expeditionary Air Force. This includes basic war skills, military discipline, physical fitness, drill and ceremonies, Air Force core values and a comprehensive range of subjects relating to Air Force life.\\r\\nMore than 7 million young men and women have entered Air Force basic military training since 4 February 1946, when the training mission was moved to Lackland from Harlingen Air Force Base in Harlingen, Texas. Throughout its history, Lackland's BMT program has changed in many ways to meet the operational needs of the Air Force and recent updates in the curriculum are some of the most significant in its more than 60-year history, with every aspect of the program overhauled.\\r\\nOn 7 November 2005, BMT changed its curriculum to focus on a new kind of Airmanone who is a \\"warrior first\\". The goal is to instill a warrior mindset in trainees from day one and better prepare Airmen for the realities of the Expeditionary Air Force.\\r\\nThe changes resulted from the need to meet current and future operational Air Force requirements. In September 2004, the 20th Basic Military Training Review Committee met at Lackland and recommended significant changes in the focus, curriculum and schedule.[1]\\r\\nIn 2011, it was revealed that a number of military training instructors engaged in inappropriate and illegal sexual relationships and advances against dozens of female trainees. The scandal led seventy-seven Congressional representatives to call for a hearing to investigate the incident.[2]\\r\\nMilitary Training Instructors, or MTIs, are the instructors who are responsible for most of the training that takes place in BMT. They accompany trainees throughout the training process, instructing and correcting them in everything, from correct procedures for firing a weapon to the correct way to speak to a superior. They are known for their campaign covers typically called \\"Smokey the Bear\\" or \\"Smokey\\" hats. Unlike the Marine Corps Drill Instructors and Army Drill Sergeants, Training Instructor hats are a dark blue instead of brown.\\r\\nPrior to arriving at basic training, all prospective trainees undergo a physical examination by a doctor at their local Military Entrance Processing Station, or MEPS. Trainees receive their initial weigh-in when they arrive at Lackland. If the trainee is under or over the height and weight standards, the trainee is placed on double rations if underweight (known colloquially in BMT as a \\"skinny\\"), or in a \\"diet\\" status if overweight.\\r\\nAll trainees receive three meals a day, also known as \\"chow time\\". These are either served at the dining facility (DFAC, also known as the \\"chow hall\\"), or as a Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) during field training. Meal time may last 30 minutes or less, depending on the order the flight arrives at the chow hall. Trainees are mandated a minimum of 15 minutes to consume each meal. Much of the 15 minutes may be spent waiting in line, trainee \\"water monitors\\" reporting in the chow hall and removing, properly storing and re-donning any carried equipment.\\r\\nTrainees that sustain injuries or illnesses that disrupt their training are transferred to the Medical Hold Flight. Once they are again medically fit, the trainee will generally return to their prior training squadron as part of a flight currently at an equivalent place in the training cycle that they left.\\r\\nBasic Military Training is an eight-and-a-half-week cycle of training which begins with the receiving phase (also known as zero week) and ending with graduation.[3]\\r\\nInbound trainees are transported to Air Force Basic Military Training at Lackland Air Force Base. Upon arrival at Lackland, trainees will be assigned to a Squadron and a Flight. Trainees will then be rushed up to their dorm rooms where they will be given a bed and a wall locker (Personal Living Area or PLA) that they will take care of for the next eight and a half weeks. They will also be briefed on meal time procedures in the Dining Facility (DFAC) and other essential ground rules that will apply throughout the duration of Basic Training.\\r\\nAs the initial uniform issue is not until the following Thursday or Friday, trainees will be required to wear civilian clothes for at least one full day. During this period, trainees will be referred to as a \\"Rainbow Flight\\" or simply as \\"Rainbows\\" because of the flight's bright and varied clothing.[4] In order to break in their new boots, trainees will alternate wearing sneakers and boots with their newly issued uniforms until the end of Zero Week, earning them the nickname \\"Sneaker Weekers\\" or \\"Baby Flights\\". After first clothing issue, civilian belongings and baggage will be secured and stored for the remainder of BMT.\\r\\nTrainees will undergo a urinalysis test the day after arrival. Any trainee that fails the drug test will immediately be separated from the military. The trainees are given an opportunity to phone a family member to inform them of safe arrival and mailing instructions, then are searched for contrabandthis is called a shakedown. Next, males receive their first military haircut, often called a buzz cut, where they are left essentially bald. Females are instructed in the authorized hairstyling, which allow hair to be short enough to not touch the collar or in a bun.\\r\\nZero week lasts only until the first Sunday when trainees can attend the religious service of their choice. There are a wide range of religions represented at Lackland. Sunday is the non-duty day each week in Basic Training.\\r\\nThe remainder of in-processing involves completion of paperwork, receiving vaccines and medical tests and the first physical fitness test.\\r\\nThe first test will consist of one minute timed push ups, one minute of sit ups and a timed 1.5-mile run. After the first physical fitness test, all Trainees will be put into a fitness group. If a Trainee does not meet the basic needs, he/she will be put into a remedial group that will have extra PT sessions throughout the week.\\r\\nAfter the first physical fitness test, the MTI can issue disciplinary action in the form of typical push ups, flutter kicks and squat thrust or any other exercise that the MTI thinks is necessary as a correction for simple mistakes. Trainees will be expected to adhere to the rules by this time or face correction by physical exercise, or go through the chain of commandbeginning with the section supervisor, depending on the severity of the misconduct.\\r\\nThe following chart shows physical fitness achievement levels as well as the minimum requirements for graduating Air Force Basic Military Training:\\r\\nThis is the Pre-Deployment Phase. Here trainees will sit down with a job counselor and are shown a list of jobs they qualify forand that are availableand are instructed to prioritize that list in order of preference. The job counselors then take the preferences and the preferences of all of the other recruits in the same week of training that are in the same guaranteed aptitude area and try and work it out the best they can to give everyone the preferences they want.[5] Those who enlisted with a guaranteed job will not go though this process.\\r\\nTrainees undergo extensive training with the M-16. Trainees will learn and practice the rules for safe use and handling of the weapon. They will also receive training in how to assemble, disassemble, clean and repair the M-16.\\r\\nIn Week 4, Trainees will attend the FEST Courses teaching them the basics needed to move onto the BEAST during the 5th WOT. Activities include basic Rifle Fighting techniques, crawling through a sand course and learning how to move in columns and use proper hand signaling. Trainees will also go through CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear Environment) training and learn how to counter threats such as terrorism,[6] biological and chemical weapons and security breaches. Included in the CBRNE training is gas mask and MOPP gear training, where trainees will be exposed to CS Gas. Trainees also take official BMT Portraits during the fourth week[7]\\r\\nDuring Week Five, trainees will be sent to the BEAST on the Medina Annex. The BEAST, or Basic Expeditionary Airman Skills Training, is the final test in BMT. This represents the culmination of all the skills and knowledge an Airman should possess. These skills and tactics the trainees have learned will be put to test in realistic field training exercises and combat scenarios.[8]\\r\\nIt is a 5-day exercise that will test all of the CBRNE skills that the trainees were taught in the fifth week of training. The trainees will also be taught basic combatives as well as engaging in pugil stick battles utilizing the rifle fighting techniques they were taught. The trainees are required to wear body armor and helmets, as well as two canteens and an M16. The site has four zones, called Reaper, Phantom, Vigilant and Sentinel, that simulate self-contained forward operating bases. Each zone is a ring of 10 field tents for barracks, centered around a three-story observation tower and a hardened briefing facility that serves as an armory and bomb shelter. The zone is defended by five sandbag defensive firing positions and trainees control access to the zone through an entry control point.[9]\\r\\nThe trainees will also visit CATM where they will fire and qualify using an M16A2 rifle. During the actual firing, trainees will fire at a man-sized target at 75 yards, 180 yards and 300 yards in the standing, sitting, kneeling and prone positions. A total of 24 rounds will be fired during the qualification, the targets must be hit at least 17 times in order to become qualified with the weapon and those who hit the targets at least 22 times qualify for the Small Arms Expert Ribbon.[10]\\r\\nTrainees will train on their SABC, FEST and CBRNE skills to have a grasp on the basics of conducting UXO (Unexploded Ordnance) sweeps, helping a downed or injured Airman and doing the PAR and SALUTE reports they were taught during their CBRNE course the week prior. They will be taught how to identify potential threats and who to report them to in their chain of command. BEAST week will be almost entirely devoted to scenario training. As they take advantage of more field time to hone their newly acquired infantry skills, the trainees also will have more hands-on instruction in buddy care, culminating in an evaluation for each zone to see which zone has the won the coveted title of BEAST excellence which is announced at the culmex ceremony on Friday afternoon.[11] The BEAST site includes a 1.5-mile improvised explosive device (IED) trail littered with simulated roadside bombs. Trainees learn to spot IEDs and then use the trail in training scenarios. For example, under one scenario trainees make their way down the \\"lane\\" in tactical formation, trying to identify IEDs from the other debris such as soda cans. At the end of the trail, trainees are broken into teams of two \\"wingmen\\" and negotiate a combat-obstacle course (low-crawl, hide behind walls, roll behind barriers, strike dummies with the butt of your rifle, high crawl 60 yards through deep sand up a 40 percent grade). Trainees will also go participate in a CLAW mission during BEAST week. CLAW stands for Creating Leader Airmen Warriors. The CLAW mission consists of traversing a \\"simulated\\" river using the instructions and supplies on hand which stresses teamwork. They will then move in staggered tactical formation to another checkpoint where they will work on their SABC skills, then they will go through the combat obstacle course that was mentioned above. The biggest test is the village in which the Chalks of Trainees will have to either rescue a \\"downed\\" Airman and evacuate the training dummy or they will have to neutralize the targets and \\"simulated\\" gunners in the village while sustaining as few casualties as possible.[12][13] Teamwork is stressed, as the majority of tasks are completely impossible without iteach group must succeed or fail as a whole. The others will result in failure unless every trainee passes through together, requiring the team to aid its fellow trainee(s) who struggle in the accomplishment of the given mission. On the last day the trainees will have a culmex ceremony in which their MTI will award them their dog tags.\\r\\nWeek Six of BMT focuses primarily on post-deployment training. During this week, they will receive intensive classroom instruction about the difficulties many military members face when they return from a deployment, such as financial management, family issues and alcohol abuse. Trainees will also continue to practice drill and have dorm inspections. Trainees will also learn about Air Force history and heritage during this week.[14] The final physical fitness test is also given this week. Trainees who fail the final PT test will be transferred to the \\"Get Fit\\" flight, thereby providing the trainee extra time to improve fitness scores. The Air Force End of Course exam is also given during the Friday of the 6th week and Trainees will at some point during this week find out their AFSC if one was not already assigned when they arrived at BMT. A 70 or above is required to pass the EOC with Honor Grad candidacy being reached at 90.\\r\\nOn the final Thursday of BMT, all trainees will participate in the 1.5-mile run known as the \\"Airman's Run\\". The run is a victory celebration of the challenges overcome and esprit de corps gained by Airmen during training. Family and friends will be able to attend the days events and see their loved ones for the first time since the start of basic training. The Airman's Run will be followed by the Coin and Retreat Ceremony. Trainees will be presented with the Airman's Coin which signifies the transition from Trainee and have earned the right to be called an Airman. After the Airmen are dismissed, they will be able to spend the remainder of the day with loved ones.\\r\\nFriday is the Graduation Parade. The flights will pass in review, take their final oath of enlistment and are then dismissed which marks the end of Air Force Basic Military Training and the beginning of an Airman's career. Family and friends will be able to see their Airman's living quarters at the dormitory, tour the base and San Antonio following the ceremony. The weekend will be spent returning to the flight in the evening and spending the daylight hours on Base Liberty or Town Pass.\\r\\nStarting in March 2015, BMT was altered, graduation occurs during the seventh week and the weekend after graduation, the new Airmen are moved to the Airman's Week dorms generally into a dorm with people going to the same Technical Training bases as themselves. During this week, Airmen participate in classes and activities designed to help them become more independent thinkers and to make them aware of some of the problems facing young Airmen in both Tech Training and beyond, including mental, academic and social stresses that often affect new Airmen. During this week, Airmen are granted more freedoms, to include base liberties after duty hours and a more relaxed dining facility, with Airmen no longer being required to march and are now allowed to talk to each other and classroom sessions are mixed gender.\\r\\nMonday morning following the end of Airman's Week, all Airmen will proceed to the appropriate technical training school for their Air Force Specialty Code. This technical training typically lasts anywhere from one month to over two years.[15]\\r\\nActivities that are prohibited during Basic Training include (but are not limited to):\\r\\nWhen a trainee engages in a prohibited activity, their MTI may recommend the Commander impose non-judicial punishment (UCMJ Article 15). An Article 15 is a type of disciplinary action (also known as non-judicial punishment) and can entail any or all of the following:\\r\\nA trainee can be discharged from the Air Force before the conclusion of Basic Military Training. Discharges that occur before the completion of 180 days (approximately 6 months) of training are considered uncharacterized, which are neither honorable nor less than honorable.\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the United States Air Force website http://www.af.mil.\\r\\nCoordinates: 29233N 983452W? / ?29.38417N 98.58111W? / 29.38417; -98.58111","input":"Where is the air force boot camp located?"},{"output":"Shirley Anita Chisholm","context":"Shirley Anita Chisholm (ne St. Hill; November 30, 1924 ÿ January 1, 2005) was an American politician, educator, and author.[1] In 1968, she became the first black woman elected to the United States Congress,[2] and she represented New York's 12th Congressional District for seven terms from 1969 to 1983. In 1972, she became the first black candidate for a major party's nomination for President of the United States, and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.[2]\\r\\nIn 2015, Chisholm was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShirley Anita St. Hill was born on November 30, 1924, in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents from the Caribbean region.[4] She had three younger sisters,[5] two born within three years after St. Hill, one later.[6] Their father, Charles Christopher St. Hill, was born in British Guiana,[7] lived in Barbados for a while,[6] and then arrived in the United States via Antilla, Cuba, on April 10, 1923, aboard the S.S. Munamar in New York City.[7] Their mother, Ruby Seale, was born in Christ Church, Barbados, and arrived in New York City aboard the S.S. Pocone on March 8, 1921.[8]\\r\\nHer father was an unskilled laborer who sometimes worked in a factory that made burlap bags, but when he could not find factory employment instead worked as a baker's helper, while her mother was a skilled seamstress and domestic worker who had trouble working and raising the children at the same time.[9][10] As a consequence, in November 1929 as St. Hill turned five, she and her two sisters were sent to Barbados on the S.S. Vulcana to live with their maternal grandmother, Emaline Seale.[10] There they lived on the grandmother's farm in the Vauxhall village in Christ Church, where she attended a one-room schoolhouse that took education seriously.[11] She did not return to the United States until May 19, 1934, aboard the SS Nerissa in New York.[12] As a result, St. Hill spoke with a recognizable West Indian accent throughout her life.[5] In her 1970 autobiography Unbought and Unbossed, she wrote: \\"Years later I would know what an important gift my parents had given me by seeing to it that I had my early education in the strict, traditional, British-style schools of Barbados. If I speak and write easily now, that early education is the main reason.\\"[13] As a result of her time on the island, and regardless of her U.S. birth, St. Hill would always consider herself a Barbadian American.[14] Regarding the role of her grandmother, she later said, \\"Granny gave me strength, dignity, and love. I learned from an early age that I was somebody. I didn't need the black revolution to tell me that.\\"[15]\\r\\nBeginning in 1939, St. Hill attended Girls' High School in the BedfordÿStuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, a highly regarded, integrated school that attracted girls from throughout Brooklyn.[16] St. Hill earned her Bachelor of Arts from Brooklyn College in 1946, where she won prizes for her debating skills.[9] She was a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority.\\r\\nSt. Hill met Conrad O.

By May 1965 she had already been honored in a \\"Salute to Women Doers\\" affair in New York.[21] One of her early activities in the Assembly was to argue against the state's literacy test requiring English, holding that just because a person \\"functions better in his native language is no sign a person is illiterate.\\"[22] By early 1966 she was a leader in a push by the statewide Council of Elected Negro Democrats for black representation on key committees in the Assembly.[23]\\r\\nHer successes in the legislature included getting unemployment benefits extended to domestic workers.[24] She also sponsored the introduction of a SEEK program (Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge) to the state, which provided disadvantaged students the chance to enter college while receiving intensive remedial education.[24]\\r\\nIn August 1968, she was elected as the Democratic National Committeewoman from New York State.[25]\\r\\nIn 1968 she ran for the U.S. House of Representatives from New York's 12th congressional district, which as part of a court-mandated reapportionment plan had been significantly redrawn to focus on Bedford-Stuyvesant and was thus expected to result in Brooklyn's first black member of Congress.[26] (Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. had, in 1945, become the first black member of Congress from New York City as a whole.) As a result of the redrawing, the white incumbent in the former 12th, Representative Edna F. Kelly, sought re-election in a different district.[27] Chisholm announced her candidacy around January 1968 and established some early organizational support.[26] Her campaign slogan was \\"Unbought and unbossed\\".[25] In the June 18, 1968, Democratic primary, Chisholm defeated two other black opponents, State Senator William S. Thompson and labor official Dollie Robertson.[27] In the general election, she staged an upset victory[5] over James L. Farmer, Jr., the former director of the Congress of Racial Equality who was running as a Liberal Party candidate with Republican support, winning by an approximately two-to-one margin.[25] Chisholm thereby became the first black woman elected to Congress.[25]\\r\\nChisholm was assigned to the House Agricultural Committee. Given her urban district, she felt the placement was irrelevant to her constituents.[2] When Chisholm confided to Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson that she was upset and insulted by her assignment, Schneerson suggested that she use the surplus food to help the poor and hungry. Chisholm subsequently met Robert Dole, and worked to expand the food stamp program. She later played a critical role in the creation of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program. Chisholm would credit Schneerson for the fact that so many \\"poor babies [now] have milk and poor children have food.\\"[28] Chisholm was then also placed on the Veterans' Affairs Committee.[2] Soon after, she voted for Hale Boggs as House Majority Leader over John Conyers. As a reward for her support, Boggs assigned her to the much-prized Education and Labor Committee,[17] which was her preferred committee.[2] She was the third highest-ranking member of this committee when she retired from Congress.\\r\\nAll those Chisholm hired for her office were women; half of these were black.[2] Chisholm said that she had faced much more discrimination during her New York legislative career because she was a woman than because of her race.[2]\\r\\nChisholm joined the Congressional Black Caucus in 1971 as one of its founding members.[29] In the same year, she was also a founding member of the National Women's Political Caucus.[5]\\r\\nIn May 1971 she, along with fellow New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug, introduced a bill to provide $10 billion in federal funds for child care services by 1975.[30] A less expensive version introduced by Senator Walter Mondale[30] eventually passed the House and Senate as the Comprehensive Child Development Bill, but was vetoed by President Richard Nixon in December 1971, who said it was too expensive and would undermine the institution of the family.[31]\\r\\nChisholm began exploring her candidacy in July 1971, and formally announced her presidential bid on January 25, 1972,[2] in a Baptist church in her district in Brooklyn.[5] There she called for a \\"bloodless revolution\\" at the forthcoming Democratic nomination convention.[5] Chisholm became the first black major-party candidate to run for President of the United States, in the 1972 U.S. presidential election, making her also the first woman ever to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination (U.S. Senator Margaret Chase Smith had previously run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1964).[2]\\r\\nHer campaign was underfunded, only spending $300,000 in total.[2] She also struggled to be regarded as a serious candidate instead of as a symbolic political figure;[17] she was ignored by much of the Democratic political establishment and received little support from her black male colleagues.[32] She later said, \\"When I ran for the Congress, when I ran for president, I met more discrimination as a woman than for being black. Men are men.\\"[9] In particular, she expressed frustration about the \\"black matriarch thing\\", saying, \\"They think I am trying to take power from them. The black man must step forward, but that doesn't mean the black woman must step back.\\"[5] Her husband, however, was fully supportive of her candidacy and said, \\"I have no hangups about a woman running for president.\\"[18] Security was also a concern, as during the campaign three confirmed threats were made against her life; Conrad Chisholm served as her bodyguard until U.S. Secret Service protection was given to her in May 1972.[33]\\r\\nChisholm skipped the initial March 7 New Hampshire contest, instead focusing on the March 14 Florida primary, which she thought would be receptive due to its \\"blacks, youth and a strong women's movement\\".[2] But due to organizational difficulties and Congressional responsibilities, she only made two campaign trips there and ended with 3.5 percent of the vote for a seventh-place finish.[2][34] Chisholm had difficulties gaining ballot access, but campaigned or received votes in primaries in fourteen states.[2] Her largest number of votes came in the June 6 California primary, where she received 157,435 votes for 4.4 percent and a fourth-place finish, while her best percentage in a competitive primary came in the May 6 North Carolina one, where she got 7.5 percent for a third-place finish.[34] Overall, she won 28 delegates during the primaries process itself.[2][35] Chisholm's base of support was ethnically diverse and included the National Organization for Women. Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem attempted to run as Chisholm delegates in New York.[2] Altogether during the primary season, she received 430,703 votes, which was 2.7 percent of the total of nearly 16 million cast and represented seventh place among the Democratic contenders.[34]\\r\\nAt the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, there were still efforts taking place by the campaign of former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey to stop the nomination of Senator George McGovern. After that failed and McGovern's nomination was assured, as a symbolic gesture, Humphrey released his black delegates to Chisholm.[36] This, combined with defections from disenchanted delegates from other candidates, as well as the delegates she had won in the primaries, gave her a total of 152 first-ballot votes for the nomination during the July 12 roll call.[2] (Her precise total was 151.95.[34]) Her largest support overall came from Ohio, with 23 delegates (slightly more than half of them white),[37] even though she had not been on the ballot in the May 2 primary there.[2][34] Her total gave her fourth place in the roll call tally, behind McGovern's winning total of 1,728 delegates.[34] Chisholm said she ran for the office \\"in spite of hopeless odds ... to demonstrate the sheer will and refusal to accept the status quo.\\"[17] Among the volunteers who were inspired by her campaign was Barbara Lee, who continued to be politically active and was elected as a congresswoman 25 years later.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is sometimes stated that Chisholm won a primary during 1972, or won three states overall, with New Jersey, Louisiana, and Mississippi being so identified. None of these fit the usual definition of winning a plurality of the contested popular vote or delegate allocations at the time of a state primary or caucus or state convention. In the June 6 New Jersey primary, there was a complex ballot that featured both a delegate selection vote and a non-binding, non-delegate-producing \\"beauty contest\\" presidential preference vote.[38] In the delegate selection vote, Democratic front-runner Senator George McGovern defeated his main rival at that point, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, and won the large share of available delegates.[38] Most of the Democratic candidates were not on the preference ballot, including McGovern and Humphrey; of the two that were, Chisholm and former governor of North Carolina Terry Sanford,[38] Sanford had withdrawn from the contest three weeks earlier.[39] In the actual preference ballot voting, which the Associated Press described as \\"meaningless\\",[40] Chisholm received the majority of votes:[38] 51,433, which was 66.9 percent.[34] During the actual balloting at the national convention, Chisholm received votes from only 4 of New Jersey's 109 delegates, with 89 going to McGovern.[34] In the May 13 Louisiana caucuses, there was a battle between forces of McGovern and Governor George Wallace; nearly all of the delegates chosen were those who identified as uncommitted, many of them black.[41] Leading up to the convention, McGovern was thought to control 20 of Louisiana's 44 delegates, with most of the rest uncommitted.[42] During the actual roll call at the national convention, Louisiana passed at first, then cast 18? of its 44 votes for Chisholm, with the next best finishers being McGovern and Senator Henry M. Jackson with 10? each.[34][37] As one delegate explained, \\"Our strategy was to give Shirley our votes for sentimental reasons on the first ballot. However, if our votes would have made the difference, we would have gone with McGovern.\\"[37] In Mississippi, there were two rival party factions that each selected delegates at their own state conventions and caucuses: \\"regulars\\" representing the mostly white state Democratic Party and \\"loyalists\\" representing many blacks and white liberals.[42][43] Each slate professed to be largely uncommitted, but the regulars were thought to favor Wallace and the loyalists McGovern.[43] By the time of the national convention, the loyalists were seated following a credentials challenge, and their delegates were characterized as mostly supporting McGovern, with some support for Humphrey.[42] During the convention, some McGovern delegates became angry about what they saw as statements from McGovern that backed away from his commitment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia, and cast protest votes for Chisholm as a result.[44] During the actual balloting, Mississippi went in the first half of the roll call, and cast 12 of its 25 votes for Chisholm, with McGovern coming next with 10 votes.[34]\\r\\nDuring the campaign the German filmmaker Peter Lilienthal shot the documentary film Shirley Chisholm for President for German Television channel ZDF.\\r\\nChisholm created controversy when she visited rival and ideological opposite George Wallace in the hospital soon after his shooting in May 1972, during the presidential primary campaign. Several years later, when Chisholm worked on a bill to give domestic workers the right to a minimum wage, Wallace helped gain votes of enough Southern congressmen to push the legislation through the House.[45]\\r\\nFrom 1977 to 1981, during the 95th Congress and 96th Congress, Chisholm was elected to a position in the House Democratic leadership, as Secretary of the House Democratic Caucus.[46]\\r\\nThroughout her tenure in Congress, Chisholm worked to improve opportunities for inner-city residents. She was a vocal opponent of the draft and supported spending increases for education, health care and other social services, and reductions in military spending.\\r\\nIn the area of national security and foreign policy, Chisholm worked for the revocation of Internal Security Act of 1950.[47] She opposed the American involvement in the Vietnam War and the expansion of weapon developments. During the Jimmy Carter administration, she called for better treatment of Haitian refugees.[48]\\r\\nChisholm's first marriage ended in divorce in February 1977.[17] Later that year she married Arthur Hardwick, Jr., a former New York State Assemblyman whom Chisholm had known when they both served in that body and who was now a Buffalo liquor store owner.[9][17] Chisholm had no children.[17]\\r\\nHardwick was subsequently injured in an automobile accident; desiring to take care of him, and also dissatisfied with the course of liberal politics in the wake of the Reagan Revolution, she announced her retirement from Congress in 1982.[9] Hardwick died in 1986.[17]\\r\\nAfter leaving Congress, Chisholm made her home in suburban Williamsville, New York.[50][51] She resumed her career in education, being named to the Purington Chair at the all-women Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts.[52] As such she was not a member of any particular department, but would be able to teach classes in a variety of areas;[53] those previously holding the position included W. H. Auden, Bertrand Russell, and Arna Bontemps.[50]\\r\\nAt Mount Holyoke, she taught politics and sociology from 1983 to 1987.[52] She focused on undergraduate courses that covered politics as it involved women and race.[51] Dean of faculty Joseph Ellis later said that Chisholm \\"contributed to the vitality of the College and gave the College a presence.\\"[52] In 1985 she was a visiting scholar at Spelman College.\\r\\nDuring those years, she continued to give speeches at colleges, by her own count visiting over 150 campuses since becoming nationally known.[51] She told students to avoid polarization and intolerance: \\"If you don't accept others who are different, it means nothing that you've learned calculus.\\"[51] Continuing to be involved politically, she traveled to visit different minority groups and urging them to become a strong force at the local level.[51] In 1984 and 1988, she campaigned for Jesse Jackson for the presidential elections.[54] In 1990, Chisholm, along with 15 other black women and men, formed the African-American Women for Reproductive Freedom.[55]\\r\\nChisholm retired to Florida in 1991.[9] In 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated her to be United States Ambassador to Jamaica, but she could not serve due to poor health and the nomination was withdrawn.[56] In the same year she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[57]\\r\\nChisholm died on January 1, 2005, in Ormond Beach near Daytona Beach, after suffering several strokes.[9] She is buried in the Oakwood Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo, where the legend inscribed on her vault reads: \\"Unbought and Unbossed\\".\\r\\nIn February 2005, Shirley Chisholm '72: Unbought and Unbossed, a documentary film,[58] aired on U.S public television. It chronicled Chisholm's 1972 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. It was directed and produced by independent African-American filmmaker Shola Lynch. The film was featured at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004. On April 9, 2006, the film was announced as a winner of a Peabody Award.[59]\\r\\nChisholm's legacy came into renewed prominence during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton staged their historic 'firsts' battle ÿ where the victor would either be the first major party African-American nominee, or the first woman nominee ÿ with at least one observer crediting Chisholm's 1972 campaign as having paved the way for both of them.[32]\\r\\nThe Shirley Chisholm Center for Research on Women exists at Brooklyn College to promote research projects and programs on women and to preserve the legacy of Chisholm.[60] The college's library also houses an archive called the Shirley Chisholm Project on Brooklyn Women's Activism.[61]\\r\\nIn 2014, the first adult biography of Chisholm was published, Shirley Chisholm: Catalyst for Change, by Brooklyn College history professor Barbara Winslow. Until then, only several juvenile biographies had appeared.[62]\\r\\nChisholm's speech \\"For the Equal Rights Amendment\\", given in 1970, is listed as #91 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).[63][64]\\r\\nChisholm has had a profound impact on other women of color in politics. California Congresswoman Barbara Lee stated in 2017 interview that Chisholm had a profound impact on her career.[65]\\r\\nChisholm wrote two autobiographical books.","input":"Who was the first african american woman elected to congress?"},{"output":"T.

From breakdown of proteins, these substrates include glucogenic amino acids (although not ketogenic amino acids); from breakdown of lipids (such as triglycerides), they include glycerol (although not fatty acids); and from other steps in metabolism they include pyruvate and lactate.\\r\\nGluconeogenesis is one of several main mechanisms used by humans and many other animals to maintain blood glucose levels, avoiding low levels (hypoglycemia). Other means include the degradation of glycogen (glycogenolysis)[1] and fatty acid catabolism.\\r\\nGluconeogenesis is a ubiquitous process, present in plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms.[2] In vertebrates, gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex of the kidneys. In ruminants, this tends to be a continuous process.[3] In many other animals, the process occurs during periods of fasting, starvation, low-carbohydrate diets, or intense exercise. The process is highly endergonic until it is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP or GTP, effectively making the process exergonic. For example, the pathway leading from pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate requires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP to proceed spontaneously. Gluconeogenesis is often associated with ketosis. Gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for type 2 diabetes, such as the antidiabetic drug, metformin, which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates glucose uptake by cells.[4] In ruminants, because dietary carbohydrates tend to be metabolized by rumen organisms, gluconeogenesis occurs regardless of fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, exercise, etc.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn humans the main gluconeogenic precursors are lactate, glycerol (which is a part of the triacylglycerol molecule), alanine and glutamine. Altogether, they account for over 90% of the overall gluconeogenesis.[7] Other glucogenic amino acids as well as all citric acid cycle intermediates, the latter through conversion to oxaloacetate, can also function as substrates for gluconeogenesis.[8] In ruminants, propionate is the principal gluconeogenic substrate.[5][9] Generally, consumption of gluconeogenic substrates in food does not result in increased gluconeogenesis.[10]\\r\\nLactate is transported back to the liver where it is converted into pyruvate by the Cori cycle using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate, the first designated substrate of the gluconeogenic pathway, can then be used to generate glucose.[8] Transamination or deamination of amino acids facilitates entering of their carbon skeleton into the cycle directly (as pyruvate or oxaloacetate), or indirectly via the citric acid cycle. The contribution of Cori cycle lactate to overall glucose production increases with fasting duration.[11] Specifically, after 12, 20, and 40 hours of fasting by human volunteers, the contribution of Cori cycle lactate to gluconeogenesis was 41%, 71%, and 92%, respectively.[11]\\r\\nWhether even-chain fatty acids can be converted into glucose in animals has been a longstanding question in biochemistry.[12] It is known that odd-chain fatty acids can be oxidized to yield propionyl-CoA, a precursor for succinyl-CoA, which can be converted to pyruvate and enter into gluconeogenesis. In plants, specifically seedlings, the glyoxylate cycle can be used to convert fatty acids (acetate) into the primary carbon source of the organism. The glyoxylate cycle produces four-carbon dicarboxylic acids that can enter gluconeogenesis.[8]\\r\\nIn 1995, researchers identified the glyoxylate cycle in nematodes.[13] In addition, the glyoxylate enzymes malate synthase and isocitrate lyase have been found in animal tissues.[14] Genes coding for malate synthase have been identified in other metazoans including arthropods, echinoderms, and even some vertebrates. Mammals found to possess these genes include monotremes (platypus) and marsupials (opossum) but not placental mammals. Genes for isocitrate lyase are found only in nematodes, in which, it is apparent, they originated in horizontal gene transfer from bacteria.\\r\\nThe existence of glyoxylate cycles in humans has not been established, and it is widely held that fatty acids cannot be converted to glucose in humans directly. However, carbon-14 has been shown to end up in glucose when it is supplied in fatty acids.[15] Despite these findings, it is considered unlikely that the 2-carbon acetyl-CoA derived from the oxidation of fatty acids would produce a net yield of glucose via the citric acid cycle - however, acetyl-CoA can be converted into pyruvate and lactate through the ketogenic pathway.[12][16] Put simply, acetic acid (in the form of acetyl-CoA) is used to partially produce glucose; acetyl groups can only form part of the glucose molecules (not the 5th carbon atom) and require extra substrates (such as pyruvate) in order to form the rest of the glucose molecule. But a roundabout pathway does lead from acetyl-coA to pyruvate, via acetoacetate, acetone, hydroxyacetone (acetol) and then either propylene glycol or methylglyoxal.[16][17][18]\\r\\nIn mammals, gluconeogenesis has been believed to be restricted to the liver,[19] the kidney,[19] the intestine,[20] and muscle, but recent evidence indicates gluconeogenesis occurring in astrocytes of the brain.[21] These organs use somewhat different gluconeogenic precursors. The liver preferentially uses lactate, alanine and glycerol (especially alanine) while the kidney preferentially uses lactate, glutamine and glycerol (especially glutamine).[22][7] Lactate from the Cori cycle, is quantitatively the largest source of substrate for gluconeogenesis, especially for the kidney.[7] The liver uses both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to produce glucose, whereas the kidney only uses gluconeogenesis.[7] After a meal, the liver shifts to glycogen synthesis, whereas the kidney increases gluconeogenesis.[10] The intestine uses mostly glutamine and glycerol.[20]\\r\\nPropionate is the principal substrate for gluconeogenesis in the ruminant liver, and the ruminant liver may make increased use of gluconeogenic amino acids, e.g. alanine, when glucose demand is increased.[23] The capacity of liver cells to use lactate for gluconeogenesis declines from the preruminant stage to the ruminant stage in calves and lambs.[24] In sheep kidney tissue, very high rates of gluconeogenesis from propionate have been observed.[25]\\r\\nIn all species, the formation of oxaloacetate from pyruvate and TCA cycle intermediates is restricted to the mitochondrion, and the enzymes that convert Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) to glucose are found in the cytosol.[26] The location of the enzyme that links these two parts of gluconeogenesis by converting oxaloacetate to PEPPEP carboxykinase (PEPCK)is variable by species: it can be found entirely within the mitochondria, entirely within the cytosol, or dispersed evenly between the two, as it is in humans.[26] Transport of PEP across the mitochondrial membrane is accomplished by dedicated transport proteins; however no such proteins exist for oxaloacetate.[26] Therefore, in species that lack intra-mitochondrial PEPCK, oxaloacetate must be converted into malate or aspartate, exported from the mitochondrion, and converted back into oxaloacetate in order to allow gluconeogenesis to continue.[26]\\r\\nGluconeogenesis is a pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The pathway will begin in either the liver or kidney, in the mitochondria or cytoplasm of those cells, this being dependent on the substrate being used. Many of the reactions are the reverse of steps found in glycolysis.\\r\\nWhile most steps in gluconeogenesis are the reverse of those found in glycolysis, three regulated and strongly endergonic reactions are replaced with more kinetically favorable reactions. Hexokinase/glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase enzymes of glycolysis are replaced with glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and PEP carboxykinase/pyruvate carboxylase. These enzymes are typically regulated by similar molecules, but with opposite results. For example, acetyl CoA and citrate activate gluconeogenesis enzymes (pyruvate carboxylase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, respectively), while at the same time inhibiting the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. This system of reciprocal control allow glycolysis and gluconeogenesis to inhibit each other and prevents a futile cycle of synthesizing glucose to only break it down.\\r\\nThe majority of the enzymes responsible for gluconeogenesis are found in the cytosol; the exceptions are mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase and, in animals, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. The latter exists as an isozyme located in both the mitochondrion and the cytosol.[27] The rate of gluconeogenesis is ultimately controlled by the action of a key enzyme, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, which is also regulated through signal transduction by cAMP and its phosphorylation.\\r\\nGlobal control of gluconeogenesis is mediated by glucagon (released when blood glucose is low); it triggers phosphorylation of enzymes and regulatory proteins by Protein Kinase A (a cyclic AMP regulated kinase) resulting in inhibition of glycolysis and stimulation of gluconeogenesis. Recent studies have shown that the absence of hepatic glucose production has no major effect on the control of fasting plasma glucose concentration. Compensatory induction of gluconeogenesis occurs in the kidneys and intestine, driven by glucagon, glucocorticoids, and acidosis.[28]","input":"When are amino acids used instead of glucose?"},{"output":"June 14, 1777","context":"The flag of the United States of America, often referred to as the American flag, is the national flag of the United States. It consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom) alternating with white, with a blue rectangle in the canton (referred to specifically as the \\"union\\") bearing fifty small, white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows, where rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternate with rows of five stars. The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and became the first states in the U.S.[1] Nicknames for the flag include The Stars and Stripes,[2] Old Glory,[3] and The Star-Spangled Banner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current design of the U.S. flag is its 27th; the design of the flag has been modified officially 26 times since 1777. The 48-star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49-star version became official on July 4, 1959. The 50-star flag was ordered by the then president Eisenhower on August 21, 1959, and was adopted in July 1960. It is the longest-used version of the U.S. flag and has been in use for over 57 years.[4]\\r\\nThe Continental Colors\\r\\n(aka the \\"Grand Union Flag\\")\\r\\nFlag of the British East India Company, 1707ÿ1801\\r\\nAt the time of the Declaration of Independence in July 1776, the Continental Congress would not legally adopt flags with \\"stars, white in a blue field\\" for another year. The flag contemporaneously known as \\"the Continental Colors\\" has historically been referred to as the first national flag.[5]\\r\\nThe Continental Navy raised the Colors as the ensign of the fledgling nation in the American War for Independencelikely with the expedient of transforming their previous British red ensigns by adding white stripesand would use this flag until 1777, when it would form the basis for the subsequent de jure designs.[5][6]\\r\\nThe name \\"Grand Union\\" was first applied to the Continental Colors by George Preble in his 1872 history of the U.S. flag.[6]\\r\\nThe flag closely resembles the British East India Company flag of the era, and Sir Charles Fawcett argued in 1937 that the company flag inspired the design.[7] Both flags could have been easily constructed by adding white stripes to a British Red Ensign, one of the three maritime flags used throughout the British Empire at the time. However, an East India Company flag could have from nine to 13 stripes, and was not allowed to be flown outside the Indian Ocean.[8]\\r\\nIn any case, both the stripes (barry) and the stars (mullets) have precedents in classical heraldry. Mullets were comparatively rare in early modern heraldry, but an example of mullets representing territorial divisions predating the U.S. flag are those in the coat of arms of Valais of 1618, where seven mullets stood for seven districts.\\r\\nOn June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Resolution which stated: \\"Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\\"[9] Flag Day is now observed on June 14 of each year. While scholars still argue about this, tradition holds that the new flag was first hoisted in June 1777 by the Continental Army at the Middlebrook encampment.[10]\\r\\nThe first official U.S. flag flown during battle was on August 3, 1777, at Fort Schuyler (Fort Stanwix) during the Siege of Fort Stanwix. Massachusetts reinforcements brought news of the adoption by Congress of the official flag to Fort Schuyler. Soldiers cut up their shirts to make the white stripes; scarlet material to form the red was secured from red flannel petticoats of officers' wives, while material for the blue union was secured from Capt. Abraham Swartwout's blue cloth coat. A voucher is extant that Capt. Swartwout of Dutchess County was paid by Congress for his coat for the flag.[11]\\r\\nThe 1777 resolution was most probably meant to define a naval ensign. In the late 18th century, the notion of a national flag did not yet exist, or was only nascent. The flag resolution appears between other resolutions from the Marine Committee. On May 10, 1779, Secretary of the Board of War Richard Peters expressed concern \\"it is not yet settled what is the Standard of the United States.\\"[12] However, the term, \\"Standard,\\" referred to a national standard for the Army of the United States. Each regiment was to carry the national standard in addition to its regimental standard. The national standard was not a reference to the national or naval flag.[13]\\r\\nThe Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement, number of points, nor orientation for the stars and the arrangement or whether the flag had to have seven red stripes and six white ones or vice versa.[14] The appearance was up to the maker of the flag. Some flag makers arranged the stars into one big star, in a circle or in rows and some replaced a state's star with its initial.[15] One arrangement features 13 five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, with the stars arranged pointing outwards from the circle (as opposed to up), the so-called Betsy Ross flag. This flag, however, is more likely a flag used for celebrations of anniversaries of the nation's birthday. Experts have dated the earliest known example of this flag to be 1792 in a painting by John Trumbull.[16]\\r\\nDespite the 1777 resolution, the early years of American independence featured many different flags. Most were individually crafted rather than mass-produced. While there are many examples of 13-star arrangements, some of those flags included blue stripes as well as red and white. Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, in a letter dated October 3, 1778, to Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, described the American flag as consisting of \\"13 stripes, alternately red, white, and blue, a small square in the upper angle, next the flag staff, is a blue field, with 13 white stars, denoting a new Constellation.\\"[17] John Paul Jones used a variety of 13-star flags on his U.S. Navy ships including the well-documented 1779 flags of the Serapis and the Alliance. The Serapis flag had three rows of eight-pointed stars with stripes that were red, white, and blue. The flag for the Alliance, however, had five rows of eight-pointed stars with 13 red and white stripes, and the white stripes were on the outer edges.[18] Both flags were documented by the Dutch government in October 1779, making them two of the earliest known flags of 13 stars.[19]\\r\\nFrancis Hopkinson of New Jersey, a naval flag designer, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, designed the 1777 flag[20] while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board's Middle Department, sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777. The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee.[21] Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag, but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy. Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work. These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting's biography of Hopkinson. Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress, via the Continental Board of Admiralty, on May 25, 1780.[22] In this letter, he asked for a \\"Quarter Cask of the Public Wine\\" as payment for designing the U.S. flag, the seal for the Admiralty Board, the seal for the Treasury Board, Continental currency, the Great Seal of the United States, and other devices. However, in three subsequent bills to Congress, Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash, but he did not list his U.S. flag design. Instead, he asked to be paid for designing the \\"great Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the first bill; the \\"Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the second bill; and \\"the Naval Flag of the States\\" in the third, along with the other items. The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed, that is, a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones. The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea. By contrast, Hopkinson's flag for the United States had seven white stripes, and six red ones ÿ in reality, six red stripes laid on a white background.[23] Hopkinson's sketches have not been found, but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty (naval) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time. His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes;[24] whereas, his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones.[25] Hopkinson's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag. Remnants of Hopkinson's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President's seal.[23] When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board, his position was like that of today's Secretary of the Navy.[26] The payment was not made, however, because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress.[27][28] This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag, which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776.[29][30] Furthermore, a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10, 1779, documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army's use in battle.[31]\\r\\nThe origin of the stars and stripes design has been muddled by a story disseminated by the descendants of Betsy Ross. The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington. No evidence for this exists either in the diaries of George Washington nor in the records of the Continental Congress. Indeed, nearly a century passed before Ross' grandson, William Canby, first publicly suggested the story in 1870.[32] By her family's own admission, Ross ran an upholstery business, and she had never made a flag as of the supposed visit in June 1776.[33] Furthermore, her grandson admitted that his own search through the Journals of Congress and other official records failed to find corroboration of his grandmother's story.[34]\\r\\nThe family of Rebecca Young claimed that she sewed the first flag.[35] Young's daughter was Mary Pickersgill, who made the Star Spangled Banner Flag.[36][37] According to rumor, the Washington family coat of arms, shown in a 15th-century window of Selby Abbey, was the origin of the stars and stripes.[38]\\r\\nIn 1795, the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15 (to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the Union). For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were admitted, probably because it was thought that this would cause too much clutter. It was the 15-star, 15-stripe flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\", later known as \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", which is now the American national anthem. The flag is currently on display in the exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem\\" at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History in a two-story display chamber that protects the flag while it is on view.[39]\\r\\nOn April 4, 1818, a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid[40] in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies. The act specified that new flag designs should become official on the first July 4 (Independence Day) following admission of one or more new states. The most recent change, from 49 stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after Hawaii gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of Alaska in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.[41]\\r\\nPrior to the adoption of the 48-star flag in 1912, there was no official arrangement of the stars in the canton, although the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy used standardized designs. Throughout the 19th century there was an abundance of different star patterns, rectangular and circular.\\r\\nOn July 4, 2007, the 50-star flag became the version of the flag in longest use, surpassing the 48-star flag that was used from 1912 to 1959.\\r\\nThe U.S. flag was brought to the city of Canton (GuҊngzhu) in China in 1784 by the merchant ship Empress of China, which carried a cargo of ginseng.[42] There it gained the designation \\"Flower Flag\\" (Chinese: ; pinyin: huq; Cantonese Yale: fke).[43] According to a pseudonymous account first published in the Boston Courier and later retold by author and U.S. naval officer George H. Preble:\\r\\nWhen the thirteen stripes and stars first appeared at Canton, much curiosity was excited among the people. News was circulated that a strange ship had arrived from the further end of the world, bearing a flag \\"as beautiful as a flower\\". Every body went to see the kwa kee chuen [; Fkesyhn], or \\"flower flagship\\". This name at once established itself in the language, and America is now called the kwa kee kwoh [??; Fkegwok], the \\"flower flag country\\"and an American, kwa kee kwoh yin [??; Fkegwokyhn]\\"flower flag countryman\\"a more complimentary designation than that of \\"red headed barbarian\\"the name first bestowed upon the Dutch.[44][45]\\r\\nIn the above quote, the Chinese words are written phonetically based on spoken Cantonese. The names given were common usage in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[46] Other Asian nations have equivalent terms for America, for example Vietnamese: Hoa K? (\\"Flower Flag\\"). Chinese now refer to the United States as simplified Chinese: ˇ; traditional Chinese: ˇ??; pinyin: Migu܇. Mi is short for Miljin (simplified Chinese: ˇͫ; traditional Chinese: ˇͫ??, phono-semantic matching of \\"American\\") and \\"gu܇\\" means \\"country\\", so this name is unrelated to the flag. However, the \\"flower flag\\" terminology persists in some places today: for example, American Ginseng is called simplified Chinese: y; traditional Chinese: ??; literally: \\"flower flag ginseng\\" in Chinese, and Citibank, which opened a branch in China in 1902, is known as 跐k; \\"Flower Flag Bank\\".[46]\\r\\nThe U.S. flag took its first trip around the world in 1787ÿ90 on board the Columbia.[43] William Driver, who coined the phrase \\"Old Glory\\", took the U.S. flag around the world in 1831ÿ32.[43] The flag attracted the notice of Japanese when an oversized version was carried to Yokohama by the steamer Great Republic as part of a round-the-world journey in 1871.[47]\\r\\nIn the following table depicting the 28 various designs of the United States flag, the star patterns for the flags are merely the usual patterns, often associated with the United States Navy. Canton designs, prior to the proclamation of the 48-star flag, had no official arrangement of the stars. Furthermore, the exact colors of the flag were not standardized until 1934.[48]\\r\\nIn the November 2012 U.S. election, Puerto Rico voted to become a U.S. state. However, the legitimacy of the result of this election was disputed.[50] On June 11, 2017, another referendum was held, this time with the result that 97% of voters in Puerto Rico voted for statehood, but it had a turnout of only 23%.[51][52] Similarly in November 2016, a statehood referendum was held in the District of Columbia where 86% of voters approved the proposal. If a new U.S. state were to be admitted, it would require a new design on the flag to accommodate the additional star.[53]\\r\\nThe modern meaning of the flag was forged in December 1860, when Major Robert Anderson moved the U.S. garrison from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. Author Adam Goodheart argues this was the opening move of the American Civil War, and the flag was used throughout northern states to symbolize U.S. nationalism and rejection of secessionism.\\r\\nBefore that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory, flown from forts, embassies, and ships, and displayed on special occasions like American Independence day. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flewas it does today, and especially as it did after the September 11 attacks in 2001from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. For the first time American flags were mass-produced rather than individually stitched and even so, manufacturers could not keep up with demand. As the long winter of 1861 turned into spring, that old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.\\r\\nÿ Adam Goodheart.[54]\\r\\nThe flag of the United States is one of the nation's most widely recognized symbols. Within the United States, flags are frequently displayed not only on public buildings but on private residences. The flag is a common motif on decals for car windows, and clothing ornaments such as badges and lapel pins. Throughout the world the flag has been used in public discourse to refer to the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe flag has become a powerful symbol of Americanism, and is flown on many occasions, with giant outdoor flags used by retail outlets to draw customers. Desecration of the flag is considered a public outrage, but remains protected as free speech. Scholars have noted the irony that \\"[t]he flag is so revered because it represents the land of the free, and that freedom includes the ability to use or abuse that flag in protest\\".[55] In worldwide comparison, Testi noted in 2010 that the United States was not unique in adoring its banner, for the flags of Scandinavian countries are also \\"beloved, domesticated, commercialized and sacralized objects\\".[56]\\r\\nThe man credited with designing the current 50 star American flag was Robert G. Heft. He was 17 years old at the time and created the flag design in 1958 as a high school class project while living with his grandparents in Ohio.[57] He received a B? on the project.[58] According to Heft, his history teacher honored their agreement to change his grade to an A after his design was selected.[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic design of the current flag is specified by 4 U.S.C.??1; 4 U.S.C.??2 outlines the addition of new stars to represent new states. The specification gives the following values:\\r\\nThese specifications are contained in an executive order which, strictly speaking, governs only flags made for or by the U.S. federal government.[62] In practice, most U.S. national flags available for sale to the public have a different width-to-height ratio; common sizes are 2 G 3?ft. or 4 G 6?ft. (flag ratio 1.5), 2.5 G 4?ft. or 5 G 8?ft. (1.6), or 3 G 5?ft. or 6 G 10?ft. (1.667). Even flags flown over the U.S. Capitol for sale to the public through Representatives or Senators are provided in these sizes.[63] Flags that are made to the prescribed 1.9 ratio are often referred to as \\"G-spec\\" (for \\"government specification\\") flags.\\r\\nThe exact red, white, and blue colors to be used in the flag are specified with reference to the CAUS Standard Color Reference of America, 10th edition. Specifically, the colors are \\"White\\", \\"Old Glory Red\\", and \\"Old Glory Blue\\".[64] The CIE coordinates for the colors of the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card were formally specified in JOSA in 1946.[65] These colors form the standard for cloth, and there is no perfect way to convert them to RGB for display on screen or CMYK for printing. The \\"relative\\" coordinates in the following table were found by scaling the luminous reflectance relative to the flag's \\"white\\".\\r\\nAs with the design, the official colors are only officially required for flags produced for the U.S. federal government, and other colors are often used for mass-market flags, printed reproductions, and other products intended to evoke flag colors. The practice of using more saturated colors than the official cloth is not new. As Taylor, Knoche, and Granville wrote in 1950: \\"The color of the official wool bunting [of the blue field] is a very dark blue, but printed reproductions of the flag, as well as merchandise supposed to match the flag, present the color as a deep blue much brighter than the official wool.\\"[67]\\r\\nSometimes, Pantone Matching System (PMS) approximations to the flag colors are used. One set was given on the website of the U.S. embassy in London as early as 1998; the website of the U.S. embassy in Stockholm claimed in 2001 that those had been suggested by Pantone, and that the U.S. Government Printing Office preferred a different set. A third red was suggested by a California Military Department document in 2002.[68] In 2001, the Texas legislature specified that the colors of the Texas flag should be \\"(1) the same colors used in the United States flag; and (2) defined as numbers 193 (red) and 281 (dark blue) of the Pantone Matching System.\\"[69]\\r\\nWhen Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood in the 1950s, more than 1,500 designs were submitted to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.[71] At the time, credit was given by the executive department to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry for the design.\\r\\nOf these proposals, one created by 17-year-old Robert G. Heft in 1958 as a school project received the most publicity. His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a Bÿ for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959.[72] According to Heft, his teacher did keep to their agreement and changed his grade to an A for the project.[60] The 49- and 50-star flags were each flown for the first time at Fort McHenry on Independence Day, in 1959 and 1960 respectively.[60]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag may be decorated with golden fringe surrounding the perimeter of the flag as long as it does not deface the flag proper. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the appearance of the flag.\\r\\nThe first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the Army used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the attorney general addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars) \\"...?is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy?...\\" as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of Title 4 of the United States Code law books and is a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian. However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered, there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.[73] Several federal courts have upheld this conclusion,[74][75] most recently and forcefully in Colorado v. Drew, a Colorado Court of Appeals judgment that was released in May 2010.[76] Traditionally, the Army and Air Force use a fringed National Color for parade, color guard and indoor display, while the Sea Services (Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) use a fringeless National Color for all occasions.\\r\\nThe flag is customarily flown year-round at most public buildings, and it is not unusual to find private houses flying full-size (3 by 5 feet (0.91 by 1.52?m)) flags. Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Presidents' Day, Flag Day, and on Independence Day. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans. Also on Memorial Day it is common to fly the flag at half staff, until noon, in remembrance of those who lost their lives fighting in U.S. wars.\\r\\nThe United States Flag Code outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag. For example, the flag should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the ensign responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This tradition may come from the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, where countries were asked to dip their flag to King Edward VII: the American flag bearer did not. Team captain Martin Sheridan is famously quoted as saying \\"this flag dips to no earthly king\\", though the true provenance of this quotation is unclear.[77][78]\\r\\nThe flag should never be allowed to touch the ground and, if flown at night, must be illuminated. If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement ceremonies, often on Flag Day, June 14. (The Boy Scouts of America recommends that modern nylon or polyester flags be recycled instead of burned, due to hazardous gases being produced when such materials are burned.)[79]\\r\\nThe Flag Code prohibits using the flag \\"for any advertising purpose\\" and also states that the flag \\"should not be embroidered, printed, or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use\\".[80] Both of these codes are generally ignored, almost always without comment.\\r\\nSection 8, entitled Respect For Flag states in part: \\"The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\\", and \\"No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform\\". Section 3 of the Flag Code[81] defines \\"the flag\\" as anything \\"by which the average person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the United States of America\\".\\r\\nAn additional part of Section 8 Respect For Flag, that is frequently violated at sporting events is part (c) \\"The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.\\"\\r\\nAlthough the Flag Code is U.S. federal law, there is no penalty for a private citizen or group failing to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforcedindeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.[82] Passage of the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment would overrule legal precedent that has been established.\\r\\nWhen the flag is affixed to the right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any physical object that moves), it should be oriented so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag decals on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.\\r\\nThe flag has been displayed on every U.S. spacecraft designed for manned flight, including Mercury, Gemini, Apollo Command/Service Module, Apollo Lunar Module, and the Space Shuttle. The flag also appeared on the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle used for Apollo. But since Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were launched and landed vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight as the Space Shuttle did on its landing approach, the \\"streaming\\" convention was not followed and these flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally, perpendicular to the direction of flight.\\r\\nOn some U.S. military uniforms, flag patches are worn on the right shoulder, following the vehicle convention with the union toward the front. This rule dates back to the Army's early history, when both mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer, who carried the Colors into battle. As he charged, his forward motion caused the flag to stream back. Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right, while the stripes flew to the left.[83] Several US military uniforms, such as flight suits worn by members of the United States Air Force and Navy, have the flag patch on the left shoulder.[84][85]\\r\\nOther organizations that wear flag patches on their uniforms can have the flag facing in either direction. The congressional charter of the Boy Scouts of America stipulates that Boy Scout uniforms should not imitate U.S. military uniforms; consequently, the flags are displayed on the right shoulder with the stripes facing front, the reverse of the military style.[86] Law enforcement officers often wear a small flag patch, either on a shoulder, or above a shirt pocket.\\r\\nEvery U.S. astronaut since the crew of Gemini 4 has worn the flag on the left shoulder of his or her space suit, with the exception of the crew of Apollo 1, whose flags were worn on the right shoulder. In this case, the canton was on the left.\\r\\nThe flag did not appear on U.S. postal stamp issues until the Battle of White Plains Issue was released in 1926, depicting the flag with a circle of 13 stars. The 48-star flag first appeared on the General Casimir Pulaski issue of 1931, though in a small monochrome depiction. The first U.S. postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject was issued July 4, 1957, Scott catalog number 1094.[87] Since that time the flag has frequently appeared on U.S. stamps.\\r\\nIn 1907 Eben Appleton, New York stockbroker and grandson of Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead (the commander of Fort McHenry during the 1814 bombardment) loaned the Star Spangled Banner Flag to the Smithsonian Institution, and in 1912 he converted the loan to a gift. Appleton donated the flag with the wish that it would always be on view to the public. In 1994, the National Museum of American History determined that the Star Spangled Banner Flag required further conservation treatment to remain on public display. In 1998 teams of museum conservators, curators, and other specialists helped move the flag from its home in the Museum's Flag Hall into a new conservation laboratory. Following the reopening of the National Museum of American History on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a special exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem,\\" where it rests at a 10 degree angle in dim light for conservation purposes.[39]\\r\\nBy presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, U.S. flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.\\r\\nThe flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following days:[103]\\r\\nThe flag is displayed at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) as a sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; statewide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.\\r\\nTo properly fly the flag at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist it top of the staff, then lower it to the half-staff position, halfway between the top and bottom of the staff. Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half-staff, it should be first briefly hoisted to the top of the staff.[107]\\r\\nFederal statutes provide that the flag should be flown at half-staff on the following dates:\\r\\nNational Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, on July 27, was formerly a day of half-staff observance until the law expired in 2003. In 2009, it became a day of full-staff observance.[104][113][104]\\r\\nThough not part of the official Flag Code, according to military custom, flags should be folded into a triangular shape when not in use. To properly fold the flag:\\r\\nThere is also no specific meaning for each fold of the flag. However, there are scripts read by non-government organizations and also by the Air Force that are used during the flag folding ceremony. These scripts range from historical timelines of the flag to religious themes.[114][115]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag of the United States plays a role in military funerals,[116] and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents). A burial flag is draped over the deceased's casket as a pall during services. Just prior to the casket being lowered into the ground, the flag is ceremonially folded and presented to the deceased's next of kin as a token of respect.[117]\\r\\nFlag of Bikini Atoll\\r\\nFlag of Liberia\\r\\nFlag of Malaysia\\r\\nFlag of El Salvador 1875ÿ1912\\r\\nFlag of Brittany","input":"When was the first united states flag created?"},{"output":"suicide","context":"\\"Last Resort\\" is the first single from the rock band Papa Roach's first album, Infest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song \\"Last Resort\\" is about suicide. In an interview with Songfacts, Papa Roach member Tobin Esperance spoke about the song and its lyrics, saying:\\r\\n\\"I think the lyrics had a lot to do with it. Because originally the song was about a friend of ours that we grew up with, and he was going through a rough time in his life. And there was that suicide element to it, just like growing up and the struggles of life and questioning whether or not you want to keep going on, and I think a lot of people connected with that. For the kids who had also gone through those kinds of feelings, those kinds of emotions, the lyrics really helped connect with that song.\\"[6]\\r\\nPapa Roach vocalist Jacoby Shaddix described the song as a \\"cry for help\\". He also said \\"That song was about one of my best friends, and then 12ÿ13 years later, that song was about me. I found myself in that place, where I was like, \\"I can't go on this way. I can't do it anymore.\\"\\"[7] Shaddix said that \\"Last Resort\\" is about a roommate he had who tried to commit suicide. Shaddix then said: \\"We caught him and took him to the hospital and he went into a mental facility and then he came out the other side better. He actually found God through the process, which was kind of crazy. So he's on a whole different path of his life now, which is cool. I'm really proud of him for the changes he's made in his life.\\"[8] \\"Last Resort\\" is influenced by hip hop music. Both The Fugees and Wu-Tang Clan influenced the song. Although the song doesn't feature piano, the song was composed with piano. Papa Roach member Tobin Esperance said: \\"I've written songs on piano ÿ actually, 'Last Resort' with that whole little riff/melody thing, that's done on the piano. And then I just transferred it to the guitar.\\"[6] Speaking about the making of and inspiration behind the song, Esperance said:\\r\\n\\"Well, of course at the time we were listening to a lot of Wu Tang Clan, a lot of hip-hop, and a lot of Fugees and a lot of East Coast hip-hop, and we were sampling classical music behind simple pocket grooves. I was playing something on piano and Jacoby came in and started scatting over it. And we just did our typical mixing of a funky kind of hip-hop groove with a punk rock chorus. And that song just came together like that. Jacoby said, 'That's a cool riff, keep playing that noodle' ÿ we called it a noodle. We did it over and over again, and Jacoby put his lyrics to it, and the song just morphed into what it is now. No one ever thought it was going to be a huge, huge hit, but I guess you never expect anything, really, when you're first starting out.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\"Last Resort\\" achieved mainstream success, peaking at number 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in August 2000,[9][10] number 56 on the Radio Songs chart in September 2000,[11] and number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in December 2000.[10] The popularity of \\"Last Resort\\" helped Papa Roach's album Infest get certified 3x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July 2001.[12]\\r\\nThe music video was directed by Marcos Siega.[13] In the music video, the band performs on a floor surrounded by fans. Throughout the video, the camera zooms in on a some fans near the stage and shows them in places that appear to be their rooms. In their rooms, they appear to be possibly depressed. Though it had apparently been claimed that this is meant to show how people might not look depressed but still are, the purpose was more so to show the people being taken from where they didn't want to be to where they did  from lonely despair to the rock show where they could have fun with their friends.[14] There are many posters for radio station 98 Rock. This is the rock station out of Sacramento, California that the band credits for jump starting their career. Inside the Infest album booklet are thanks to DJs of the radio station.[15] About five hundred people, including local fans, came to the shooting of the music video for \\"Last Resort\\".[13]\\r\\nOn the MuchMusic version--which utilizes the radio edit, the word \\"fuck\\" is completely removed with no replacement.

Alfred styled himself King of the Anglo-Saxons and while he was not the first king to lay claim to rule all of the English, his rule represents the first unbroken line of Kings to rule the whole of England, the House of Wessex.[1] The last monarch of a distinct kingdom of England was Anne, who became Queen of Great Britain when England merged with Scotland to form a union in 1707. \\r\\n\\r\\nArguments are made for a few different kings deemed to control enough of the ancient kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons to be deemed the first King of England. For example, Offa, king of Mercia, and Egbert, king of Wessex, are sometimes described as kings of England by popular writers, but not by all historians.[citation needed] In the late eighth century Offa achieved a dominance over southern England that did not survive his death in 796. In 829 Egbert conquered Mercia, but he soon lost control of it. By the late ninth century Wessex was the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Its king, Alfred the Great, was overlord of western Mercia and used the title King of the Angles and Saxons, but he never ruled eastern and northern England, which was then known as the Danelaw, having earlier been conquered by the Danes from Scandinavia. His son Edward the Elder conquered the eastern Danelaw, but Edward's son ?thelstan became the first king to rule the whole of England when he conquered Northumbria in 927, and he is regarded by some modern historians as the first true king of England.[2][3]  The title \\"King of the English\\" or Rex Anglorum in Latin, was first used to describe ?thelstan by one of his charters in 928.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England under the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284, and in 1301 King Edward I invested his eldest son, the future King Edward II, as Prince of Wales. Since that time, except for King Edward III, the eldest sons of all English monarchs have borne this title. After the death of Queen Elizabeth I without issue, in 1603, King James VI of Scotland also became James I of England, joining the crowns of England and Scotland in personal union. By royal proclamation, James styled himself \\"King of Great Britain\\", but no such kingdom was actually created until 1707, when England and Scotland united to form the new Kingdom of Great Britain, with a single British parliament sitting at Westminster, during the reign of Queen Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisputed\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is some evidence that ?lfweard of Wessex may have been king for up to four weeks in 924 (timing itself is unclear, as he died 16 days, not 28 days, after his father), between his father Edward the Elder and his brother ?thelstan, although he was not crowned.[8] However, this is not accepted by all historians. Also, it is unclear whetherif ?lfweard was declared kingit was over the whole kingdom or of Wessex only: one interpretation of the ambiguous evidence is that when Edward died, ?lfweard was declared king in Wessex and ?thelstan in Mercia.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland came under the control of Sweyn Forkbeard, a Danish king, after an invasion in 1013, during which ?thelred abandoned the throne and went into exile in Normandy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the death of Sweyn Forkbeard, ?thelred the Unready returned from exile and was again proclaimed king on 3 February 1014. His son succeeded him after being chosen king by the citizens of London and a part of the Witan,[35] despite ongoing Danish efforts in wresting the crown from the West Saxons.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the decisive Battle of Assandun on 18 October 1016, King Edmund signed a treaty with Cnut (Canute) in which all of England except for Wessex would be controlled by Cnut.[38] Upon Edmund's death just over a month later on 30 November, Cnut ruled the whole kingdom as its sole king for almost twenty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Harthacnut, there was a brief Saxon Restoration between 1042 and 1066.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisputed claimants (House of Wessex)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1066, several rival claimants to the English throne emerged. Among them were Harold Godwinson, elected king by the Witenagemot after the death of Edward the Confessor, as well as Harald Hardrada, King of Norway who claimed to be the rightful heir of Harthacnut, and Duke William II of Normandy, vassal to the King of France, and first cousin once-removed of Edward the Confessor. Harald and William both invaded separately in 1066. Godwinson successfully repelled the invasion by Hardrada, but ultimately lost the throne of England in the Norman conquest of England. After the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, William the Conqueror made permanent the recent removal of the capital from Winchester to London. Following the death of Harold Godwinson at Hastings, the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemot elected as king Edgar the ?theling, the son of Edward the Exile and grandson of Edmund Ironside, but the young monarch was unable to resist the invaders and was never crowned. William was crowned King William I of England on Christmas Day 1066, in Westminster Abbey, and is today known as William the Conqueror, William the Bastard or William I.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry I left no legitimate male heirs, his son William Adelin having died in the White Ship disaster. This ended the direct Norman line of kings in England. Henry named his eldest daughter, the dowager Empress Matilda as his heir. Before naming Matilda as heir, however, he had been in negotiations to name his nephew Stephen of Blois as his heir. When Henry died, Stephen invaded England, and in a coup d'etat had himself crowned instead of Matilda. The period which followed is known as The Anarchy, as parties supporting each side fought in open warfare on both Britain and on the continent for the better part of two decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisputed claimants\\r\\n\\r\\nEmpress Matilda was declared heir presumptive by her father, Henry I, after the death of her brother on the White Ship, and acknowledged as such by the barons. However, upon Henry I's death, the throne was seized by Matilda's cousin, Stephen of Blois. During the ensuing Anarchy, Matilda controlled England for a few months in 1141the first woman so to dobut was never crowned and is rarely listed as a monarch of England.[vii]\\r\\n\\r\\nCount Eustace IV of Boulogne (c. 1130 ÿ 17 August 1153) was appointed co-king of England by his father, King Stephen, on 6 April 1152, in order to guarantee his succession to the throne (as was the custom in France, but not in England). However, the Pope and the Church would not agree to this, and Eustace was not crowned. Eustace died the next year aged 23, during his father's lifetime, and so never became king in his own right.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Stephen came to an agreement with Matilda in November 1153 with the signing of the Treaty of Wallingford, where Stephen recognised Henry, son of Matilda and her second husband Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, as the designated heir. The royal house descended from Matilda and Geoffrey is widely known by two names, the House of Anjou (after Geoffrey's title as Count of Anjou) or the House of Plantagenet, after his sobriquet. Some historians prefer to group the subsequent kings into two groups, before and after the loss of the bulk of their French possessions, although they are not different royal houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Angevins ruled over the Angevin Empire during the 12th and 13th centuries, an area stretching from the Pyrenees to Ireland. They did not regard England as their primary home until most of their continental domains were lost by John. Though the Angevin dynasty was short-lived, their male line descendants included the House of Plantagenet, the House of Lancaster and the House of York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Angevins formulated England's royal coat of arms, which usually showed other kingdoms held or claimed by them or their successors, although without representation of Ireland for quite some time. Dieu et mon droit has generally been used as the motto of English monarchs since being adopted by Edward III,[59] but it was first used as a battle cry by Richard I in 1198 at the Battle of Gisors, when he defeated the forces of Philip II of France, after which, he made it his motto.[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry II named his son, another Henry (1155ÿ1183), as co-ruler with him. But this was a Norman custom of designating an heir, and the younger Henry did not outlive his father and rule in his own right, so he is not counted as a monarch on lists of kings.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisputed claimant\\r\\n\\r\\nLouis VIII of France briefly ruled about half of England from 1216 to 1217 at the conclusion of the First Barons' War against King John. On marching into London he was openly received by the rebel barons and citizens of London and proclaimed (though not crowned) king at St Paul's cathedral. Many nobles, including Alexander II of Scotland for his English possessions, gathered to give homage to him. However, in signing the Treaty of Lambeth in 1217, Louis conceded that he had never been the legitimate king of England.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe House of Plantagenet takes its name from Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, husband of the Empress Matilda and father of Henry II. The name Plantagenet itself was unknown as a family name per se until Richard of York adopted it as his family name in the 15th century. It has since been retroactively applied to English monarchs from Henry II onward. It is common among modern historians to refer to Henry II and his sons as the \\"Angevins\\" due to their vast continental Empire, and most of the Angevin kings before John spent more time in their continental possessions than in England. It is from the time of Henry III, after the loss of most of the family's continental possessions, that the Plantagenet kings became more English in nature. The Houses of Lancaster and York are cadet branches of the House of Plantagenet.\\r\\n\\r\\n[65]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis house descended from Edward III's third surviving son, John of Gaunt. Henry IV seized power from Richard II (and also displaced the next in line to the throne, Edmund Mortimer (then aged 7), a descendant of Edward III's second son, Lionel of Antwerp).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe House of York inherited its name from the fourth surviving son of Edward III, Edmund of Langley, first Duke of York, but claimed the right to the throne through Edward III's second surviving son, Lionel of Antwerp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wars of the Roses (1455ÿ1485) saw the throne pass back and forth between the rival houses of Lancaster and York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tudors descended in the female line from John Beaufort, one of the illegitimate children of John of Gaunt (third surviving son of Edward III), by Gaunt's long-term mistress Katherine Swynford. Those descended from English monarchs only through an illegitimate child would normally have no claim on the throne, but the situation was complicated when Gaunt and Swynford eventually married in 1396 (25 years after John Beaufort's birth). In view of the marriage, the church retroactively declared the Beauforts legitimate via a papal bull the same year (also enshrined in an Act of Parliament in 1397). A subsequent proclamation by John of Gaunt's legitimate son, King Henry IV, also recognised the Beauforts' legitimacy, but declared them ineligible ever to inherit the throne. Nevertheless, the Beauforts remained closely allied with Gaunt's other descendants, the Royal House of Lancaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Beaufort's granddaughter Lady Margaret Beaufort was married to Edmund Tudor. Tudor was the son of Welsh courtier Owain Tudur (anglicised to Owen Tudor) and Catherine of Valois, the widow of the Lancastrian King Henry V. Edmund Tudor and his siblings were either illegitimate, or the product of a secret marriage, and owed their fortunes to the goodwill of their legitimate half-brother King Henry VI. When the House of Lancaster fell from power, the Tudors followed. By the late 15th century, the Tudors were the last hope for the Lancaster supporters. Edmund Tudor's son became king as Henry VII after defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, winning the Wars of the Roses. King Henry married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, thereby uniting the Lancastrian and York lineages.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Henry VIII's break from the Roman Catholic Church, the monarch became the Supreme Head of the Church of England and of the Church of Ireland. Elizabeth I's title became the Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisputed claimant\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward VI named Lady Jane Grey as his heir in his will, overruling the order of succession laid down by Parliament in the Third Succession Act. Four days after his death on 6 July 1553, Jane was proclaimed queenthe first of three Tudor women to be proclaimed queen regnant. Nine days after the proclamation, on 19 July, the Privy Council switched allegiance and proclaimed Edward VI's Catholic half-sister Mary queen. Jane was executed for treason in 1554, aged 16.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the terms of the marriage treaty between Philip I of Naples (Philip II of Spain from 15 January 1556) and Queen Mary I, Philip was to enjoy Mary's titles and honours for as long as their marriage should last. All official documents, including Acts of Parliament, were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. An Act of Parliament gave him the title of king and stated that he \\"shall aid her Highness? in the happy administration of her Grace's realms and dominions\\"[93] (although elsewhere the Act stated that Mary was to be \\"sole queen\\"). Nonetheless, Philip was to co-reign with his wife.[94] As the new King of England could not read English, it was ordered that a note of all matters of state should be made in Latin or Spanish.[94][95][96] Coins were minted showing the heads of both Mary and Philip, and the coat of arms of England (pictured right) was impaled with Philip's to denote their joint reign.[97][98] Acts which made it high treason to deny Philip's royal authority were passed in England (see Treason Act 1554) and Ireland.[99] In 1555, Pope Paul IV issued a papal bull recognising Philip and Mary as rightful King and Queen of Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the death of Elizabeth I in 1603 without issue, her first cousin twice removed, King James VI of Scotland, succeeded to the English throne as James I in the Union of the Crowns. James was descended from the Tudors through his great-grandmother, Margaret Tudor, the eldest daughter of Henry VII. In 1604, he adopted the title King of Great Britain. However, the two parliaments remained separate until the Acts of Union 1707.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo monarch reigned between the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the Restoration of Charles II in 1660. Between 1649 and 1653, there was no single English head of state, as England was ruled directly by the Rump Parliament with the English Council of State acting as executive power during a period known as the Commonwealth of England. After a coup d'etat in 1653, Oliver Cromwell forcibly took control of England from Parliament. He dissolved the Rump Parliament at the head of a military force and England entered a period known as The Protectorate, under the direct control of a single individual known as the Lord Protector. While not officially monarchs, the holder of the office of Lord Protector passed from Oliver Cromwell to his son Richard. Richard lacked both the ability to rule and confidence of the Army, and he was forcibly removed by the English Committee of Safety under the leadership of Charles Fleetwood in May 1659. England again lacked any single head of state during several months of conflict between Fleetwood's party and that of George Monck. Monck took control of the country in December 1659, and after almost a year of anarchy, the monarchy was formally restored when Charles II returned from France to accept the throne of England following the Declaration of Breda and an invitation to reclaim the throne from the Convention Parliament of 1660.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Monarchy was restored, England came under the rule of Charles II, whose reign was relatively peaceful domestically, given the tumultuous time of the Interregnum years. Tensions still existed between Catholics and Protestants, however, and with the ascension of Charles's brother, the openly Catholic James II, England was again sent into a period of political turmoil. James II was ousted by Parliament less than three years after ascending to the throne, replaced by his daughter Mary II and her husband (also his nephew) William III during the Glorious Revolution. While James and his descendants would continue to claim the throne, all Catholics (such as James and his son Charles) were barred from the throne by the Act of Settlement 1701, enacted by Anne, another of James's Protestant daughters. After the Acts of Union 1707, England as a sovereign state ceased to exist, replaced by the new Kingdom of Great Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Acts of Union 1707 were a pair of Parliamentary Acts passed during 1706 and 1707 by the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland to put into effect the Treaty of Union agreed on 22 July 1706. The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland (previously separate sovereign states, with separate legislatures but with the same monarch) into the Kingdom of Great Britain.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland had shared a monarch for more than a hundred years, since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones from his first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head. There had been attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689, to unite England and Scotland by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early eighteenth century that the idea had the support of both political establishments behind it, albeit for rather different reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard title for all monarchs from ?thelstan until the time of King John was Rex Anglorum (\\"King of the English\\"). In addition, many of the pre-Norman kings assumed extra titles, as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Norman period Rex Anglorum remained standard, with occasional use of Rex Anglie (\\"King of England\\"). The Empress Matilda styled herself Domina Anglorum (\\"Lady of the English\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the time of King John onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of Rex or Regina Anglie.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1604 James I, who had inherited the English throne the previous year, adopted the title (now usually rendered in English rather than Latin) King of Great Britain. The English and Scottish parliaments, however, did not recognise this title until the Acts of Union of 1707 under Queen Anne (who was Queen of Great Britain rather than king).[xvi]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoronations","input":"Who was the first reigning monarch of england?"},{"output":"nineteen years old","context":"Margaret Hale is the heroine of Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel North and South.

The theme of challenging stereotypes is one which is integral throughout the novel.\\r\\nMargaret Hale is nineteen years old and before she was 10, lived in Helstone in Hampshire, in the south of England, with her parentsRichard, a Anglican minister, and Mariaand older brother, Frederick. When she was nine years old, Margaret was sent to live in London with her aunt, Mrs Shaw, and cousin.

The Hales realized that Frederick, branded a traitor, would be hanged if he ever returned to England.\\r\\nWhen the girls grew up, Edith married Capt. Lennox. Lennox had a younger brother, Henry, who became infatuated with Margaret. She rejected his advances, and chose to move back to Helstone. Mr Hale, however, had begun to question his faith and the doctrines laid out in the Book of Common Prayer. When asked to renew his vows by the bishop, Mr Hale could not. Quitting his profession, Mr Hale moved his wife and daughter to Milton, in the north of England, where he took up work as a tutor.\\r\\nOne of Mr Hale's pupils is a local mill owner, John Thornton. Margaret takes an instant dislike to Thornton, seeing him as the embodiment of the harsh, working-class north. Margaret, feeling homesick, romanticizes the south. Mr Thornton, on the other hand, is immediately struck by Margaret. \\"He did not understand who she was,\\" when he first saw her, \\"as he caught the simple, straight, unabashed look, which showed that his being there was of no concern to the beautiful countenance, and called up no flush of surprise to the pale ivory of the complexion. He had heard that Mr. Hale had a daughter, but he had imagined that she was a little girl.\\" Margaret eventually comes to feel at home in the north; she makes friends, including Bessy Higgins, a dying young woman.\\r\\nThe workers in all of the mills around Milton are dissatisfied and strike. As the strikers grow desperate, a mob of workers comes to the Thornton's house, where Margaret is calling on Mrs Thornton, John's mother, and his sister Fanny. Thornton goes out to speak to the rioters at Margaret's behest. Afraid that they will kill him, Margaret rushes out to Thornton. Margaret believes that no one would try to hurt a woman, and throws her arms around Thornton, to protect him. Margaret is mistaken, however. A rock is thrown from the crowd by a \\"group of lads\\", and Margaret is knocked out.\\r\\nMrs Thornton, who is wary of Margaret and her son's affection for her, surmises that Margaret acted as she did out of love for Mr Thornton. She tells her son so, and Thornton proposes to Margaret. She insists that it was her responsibility to save him because she had sent him out to talk to the men, and that she would have done the same thing for any other \\"poor desperate man in that crowd\\".\\r\\nMrs Hale, even less happy to be in Milton than Margaret, is dying. She wants to see Frederick one last time, so Margaret secretly writes to him in Spain, where he has been living.

The first, Mr Thornton, sees Margaret with an unknown man \\"with whom she had stood in an attitude of such familiar confidence\\". Margaret sees him watching her, and spends much of the rest of the novel bearing the guilt of having fallen from Thornton's regard. The other man who sees the Hale siblings is a man named Leonards. He knows that there is a bounty on Frederick's head, and tries to grab him. The two struggle and Leonards is tripped and falls onto the side of the railroad. Fatally injured, he dies the next morning.\\r\\nThere is an inquest into Leonards' death. The third person to see Margaret and her brother, a boy who works at a Milton grocer's, comes forward. He claims to have seen Margaret with the man who fought Leonards. Margaret does not know if her brother is still in the country. Trying to protect Frederick, she denies having been at the train station. Mr Thornton is a local magistrate, and becomes involved in the case. He knows that Margaret was at the station, but, still in love with her, defends her, taking over the case. Margaret is declared innocent of any involvement in Leonards' death. She knows that Thornton has heard her claiming not to have been at the train station. Margaret is humbled by Thornton's deed and is acutely aware that she must now be accounted as a liar in his eyes.\\r\\nMargaret and her father slowly begin to recover from Mrs Hale's deaththey are helped by the news of Frederick's safe return to Spain, though not by Bessy's death.

She spends much time considering the events of the past and longs to set the record straight with Thornton and win back his regard, which she believes is her only hope in repairing the damaged relationship with him. She longs for any word from Milton and, believing that she threw her one chance for happiness in marriage away, she declares to her cousin that she will never marry. She develops a close bond with Edith's young son, Sholto. It is Margaret who disciplines the child, whereas Edith would simply spoil him, and the Lennox family appreciates thisalong with their genuine love for Margaret, they encourage her to stay with them.

Patton is bitterly disappointed to learn that Erwin Rommel, Commander of the German-Italian Panzer Army, was on medical leave due to having diphtheria, but Codman reassures him that: \\"If you've defeated Rommel's plan, you've defeated Rommel\\".\\r\\nAfter success in the North Africa campaign, Patton and Bernard Montgomery separately come up with plans for the Allied invasion of Sicily. Patton's proposal to land his Seventh Army in the northwest of the island with Montgomery in the southeast (therefore potentially trapping the German and Italian forces in a pincer movement) initially impresses their superior General Alexander, however General Eisenhower rejects it in favor of Montgomery's more cautious plan, which places Patton's army in the southeast, covering Montgomery's left flank. While the landing is successful, the Allied forces become bogged down, causing Patton to defy orders and push his army northwest to Palermo, and then to the port of Messina in the northeast, narrowly beating Montgomery to the prize, although several thousand German and Italian troops are able to flee the island. Patton insists that his feud with Montgomery is due to the latter's determination to be the \\"war-hero,\\" and to deny the Americans any chance of glory. However, Patton's aggression does not sit well with his subordinates Bradley and Lucian Truscott.\\r\\nWhile on a visit to a Field Hospital where many American soldiers lie wounded or dead, Patton notices a shell-shocked soldier crying. Calling him a coward, Patton slaps the soldier and even threatens to shoot him, before demanding his immediate return to the frontline. Because of this, Patton is relieved of command and by order of Eisenhower, forced to apologize to the soldier, to those present in the Field Hospital, and to his entire command, unit by unit.\\r\\nBecause of this, and for being too liberal to the press, Patton is sidelined during the D-Day landings in 1944. Instead, he is placed in command of the phantom First United States Army Group in southeast England as a decoy. German General Alfred Jodl is convinced that Patton will lead the invasion of Europe.\\r\\nAfter begging his former subordinate Bradley for a command before the war ends, Patton is placed under him in command of the Third Army and performs brilliantly by rapidly advancing through France, but his tanks are forced to a standstill after they run out of fuel ÿ the supplies being given to Montgomery's bold Operation Market Garden, much to his fury. Later, during the Battle of the Bulge, Patton relieves the town of Bastogne and then smashes through the Siegfried Line and into Germany.\\r\\nAt a war-drive in Knutsford, England, General Patton had remarked that the United States and the United Kingdom would dominate the post-war world, viewed as an insult to the Soviet Union. After Germany capitulates, Patton directly insults a Russian general at a post-war dinner; fortunately, the Russian insults Patton back, defusing the situation. Patton then makes an offhand remark comparing the Nazi Party to the political parties in the US. In the end, Patton's outspokenness loses him his command once again, though he is kept on to see to the rebuilding of Germany, with the disconcerting incident of a runaway ox-cart narrowly missing Patton foreshadowing the general's actual death in a car accident in December 1945.\\r\\nPatton is last seen walking Willie, his bull terrier, and relating in a voice over that a returning hero of ancient Rome was honored with a \\"triumph,\\" a victory parade in which \\"a slave stood behind the conqueror, holding a golden crown, and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory ... is fleeting.\\"\\r\\nAttempts to make a film about the life of Patton had been ongoing for over fifteen years, commencing in 1953.[7] Eventually, the Patton family was approached by the producers for help in making the film. The filmmakers desired access to Patton's diaries, as well as input from family members. However, by unfortunate coincidence, the producers contacted the family the day after Beatrice Ayer Patton, the general's widow, was laid to rest. After this encounter, the family refused to provide any assistance to the film's producers.\\r\\nIn the end, screenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North wrote the script based largely on the biographies Patton: Ordeal and Triumph by Ladislas Farago and A Soldier's Story by General of the Army Omar Bradley.\\r\\nBradley served as a consultant for the film though the extent of his influence and input into the final script is largely unknown. While Bradley knew Patton personally, it was also well-known that the two men were polar opposites in personality, and there is evidence to conclude that Bradley despised Patton, both personally and professionally.[8][9] As the film was made without access to General Patton's diaries, it largely relied upon observations by Bradley and other military contemporaries when they attempted to reconstruct Patton's thoughts and motives.[10] In a review of the film, Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall, who knew both Patton and Bradley, stated, \\"The Bradley name gets heavy billing on a picture of [a] comrade that, while not caricature, is the likeness of a victorious, glory-seeking buffoon.... Patton in the flesh was an enigma. He so stays in the film.... Napoleon once said that the art of the general is not strategy but knowing how to mold human nature.... Maybe that is all producer Frank McCarthy and Gen. Bradley, his chief advisor, are trying to say.\\"[10] Although reference is made to Allied Commander General Dwight Eisenhower throughout the film, he is not portrayed on screen. At the time of production, Eisenhower was still alive, but he died in March 1969, before the film was released.\\r\\nThe film opens with Scott's rendering of Patton's speech to the Third Army, set against a huge American flag.[11] Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual words and statements in the scene, as well as throughout the rest of the film, to avoid an R rating; in the opening monologue, the word fornicating replaced fucking when he was criticizing The Saturday Evening Post. Also, Scott's gravelly and scratchy voice is the opposite of Patton's high-pitched, nasal and somewhat squeaky voice, a point noted by historian S.L.A. Marshall.[10] However, Marshall also points out that the film contains \\"too much cursing and obscenity [by Patton]. Patton was not habitually foul-mouthed. He used dirty words when he thought they were needed to impress.\\"[10]\\r\\nWhen Scott learned that the speech would open the film, he refused to do it, as he believed that it would overshadow the rest of his performance. Director Schaffner assured him that it would be shown at the end. The scene was shot in one afternoon at Sevilla Studios in Madrid, with the flag having been painted on the back of the stage wall.[12]\\r\\nAll the medals and decorations shown on Patton's uniform in the monologue are replicas of those actually awarded to Patton. However, the general never wore all of them in public and was in any case not a four-star general at the time he made the famous speeches on which the opening is based. He wore them all on only one occasion, in his backyard in Virginia at the request of his wife, who wanted a picture of him with all his medals. The producers used a copy of this photo to help recreate this \\"look\\" for the opening scene.\\r\\nMost of the film was shot in Spain. One scene, which depicts Patton driving up to an ancient city that is implied to be Carthage, was shot in the ancient Roman city of Volubilis, Morocco. The early scene, where Patton and Muhammed V are reviewing Moroccan troops including the Goumiers, was shot at the Royal Palace in Rabat. One unannounced battle scene was shot the night before, which raised fears in the Royal Palace neighborhood of a coup d'tat. One paratrooper was electrocuted in power lines, but none of this battle footage appears in the film. The scene at the dedication of the welcome centre in Knutsford, Cheshire, England, was filmed at the actual site. The scenes set in Africa and Sicily were shot in the south of Spain (Almeria), while the winter scenes in Belgium were shot near Segovia (to which the production crew rushed when they were informed that snow had fallen).[13]\\r\\nIt has been noted that in the scene where Patton arrives to establish his North African command, a supposedly \\"Arab\\" woman is selling \\"pollos y gallinas\\" (chickens and hens) in Spanish, which is not normally spoken by local people in Tunisia (though it is in the north of Morocco, Spanish Protectorate from 1912 to 1956).\\r\\nA sizeable amount of battle scene footage was left out of the final cut of Patton, but a use was soon found for it. Outtakes from Patton were used to provide battle scenes in the made-for-TV film Fireball Forward, which was first broadcast in 1972. The film was produced by Patton producer Frank McCarthy and Edmund North wrote the screenplay. One of the cast members of Patton, Morgan Paull, appeared in this production.[14]\\r\\nThe critically acclaimed score for Patton was composed and conducted by the prolific composer Jerry Goldsmith. Goldsmith used a number of innovative methods to tie the music to the film, such as having an echoplex loop recorded sounds of \\"call to war\\" triplets played on the trumpet to musically represent General Patton's belief in reincarnation. The main theme also consisted of a symphonic march accompanied by a pipe organ to represent the militaristic yet deeply religious nature of the protagonist.[15] The music to Patton subsequently earned Goldsmith an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score and was one of the American Film Institute's 250 nominees for the top twenty-five American film scores.[16] The original soundtrack has been released three times on disc and once on LP: through Twentieth-Century Fox Records in 1970, Tsunami Records in 1992, Film Score Monthly in 1999, and a two-disc extended version through Intrada Records in 2010.[15][17]\\r\\nPatton was first telecast by ABC-TV as a three hours-plus color film special in the fall of 1972, only two years after its theatrical release. That was highly unusual at the time, especially for a roadshow theatrical release, which had played in theatres for many months. Most theatrical films at that time had to wait at least five years for their first telecast. Another unusual element of the telecast was that almost none of Patton's profanity-laced dialogue was cut (only two sentences, one of which contained no profanity, were cut from the famous opening speech in front of the giant US flag).\\r\\nPatton was first released on DVD in 1999, featuring a partial audio commentary by a Patton historian, and again in 2006, with a commentary by screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola and extra bonus features.\\r\\nThe film made its Region A (locked) Blu-ray debut in 2008 to much criticism, for its excessive use of digital noise reduction on the picture quality. In 2012, a remaster was released with much improved picture quality.[18] In June 2013, Fox UK released the film on Region B Blu-ray but reverted to the 2008 transfer.\\r\\nRoger Ebert said of George C. Scott, \\"It is one of those sublime performances in which the personalities of the actor and the character are fulfilled in one another.\\"[19] Online film critic James Berardinelli has called Patton his favorite film of all time[20] and \\"to this day one of Hollywood's most compelling biographical war pictures.\\"[21]\\r\\nAccording to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book The Final Days, it was also Richard Nixon's favorite film. He screened it several times at the White House and during a cruise on the Presidential yacht. Before the 1972 Nixon visit to China, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai watched this film in preparation for his meeting with Nixon.\\r\\nReview aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 95% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 44 reviews, with an average score of 8.4/10. Rotten Tomatoes summarizes the critical consensus as, \\"George C. Scott's sympathetic, unflinching portrayal of the titular general in this sprawling epic is as definitive as any performance in the history of American biopics.\\"[22]\\r\\nIn 1971, Scott's performance won him an Academy Award for Best Actor at the 43rd Academy Awards. He famously refused to accept it, citing a dislike of the voting process and the concept of acting competitions.[23] He was the first actor to do so.\\r\\nThe film won six additional Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Sound (Douglas Williams and Don Bassman), and Best Art Direction (Art Direction: Urie McCleary and Gil Parrondo; Set Decoration: Antonio Mateos and Pierre-Louis Thvenet).[24] The Best Picture Oscar is on display at the George C. Marshall Museum at the Virginia Military Institute, courtesy of Frank McCarthy.\\r\\nIt was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects and Best Music, Original Score.[25]\\r\\nIn 2006, the Writers Guild of America selected Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund North's adapted screenplay as the 94th best screenplay of all time.\\r\\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\\r\\nA made-for-television sequel, The Last Days of Patton, was produced in 1986. Scott reprised his title role. The film was based on Patton's final weeks after being mortally injured in a car accident, with flashbacks of Patton's life.","input":"What book was the movie patton based on?"},{"output":"herbivores","context":"Consumers are organisms that eat organisms from a different population.

Job creation and unemployment are affected by factors such as economic conditions, global competition, education, automation, and demographics. These factors can affect the number of workers, the duration of unemployment, and wage levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment generally falls during periods of economic prosperity and rises during recessions, creating significant pressure on public finances as tax revenue falls and social safety net costs increase. Government spending and taxation decisions (fiscal policy) and U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate adjustments (monetary policy) are important tools for managing the unemployment rate. There may be an economic trade-off between unemployment and inflation, as policies designed to reduce unemployment can create inflationary pressure, and vice versa. The U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) has a dual mandate to achieve full employment while maintaining a low rate of inflation. The major political parties debate appropriate solutions for improving the job creation rate, with liberals arguing for more government spending and conservatives arguing for lower taxes and less regulation. Polls indicate that Americans believe job creation is the most important government priority, with not sending jobs overseas the primary solution.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment can be measured in several ways. A person is defined as unemployed in the United States if they are jobless, but have looked for work in the last four weeks and are available for work. People who are neither employed nor defined as unemployed are not included in the labor force calcualation. For example, as of September 2017, the unemployment rate in the United States was 4.2%[4] or 6.8 million people,[5] while the government's broader U-6 unemployment rate, which includes the part-time underemployed was 8.3%.[6][7] Both of these rates were below the November 2007 level that preceded the Great Recession. These figures were calculated with a civilian labor force of approximately 159.6 million people,[8] relative to a U.S. population of approximately 326 million people.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes a monthly \\"Employment Situation Summary\\" with key statistics and commentary.[10] As of June 2018, approximately 128.6 million people in the United States have found full-time work (at least 35 hours a week in total), while 27.0 million worked part-time.[11] There were 4.7 million working part-time for economic reasons, meaning they wanted but could not find full-time work, the lowest level since January 2008.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BLS reported that in July 2018, there were 94.1 million persons age 16+ outside the labor force. Of these, 88.6 million (94%) did not want a job while 5.5 million (6%) wanted a job.[13] Key reasons persons age 16+ are outside the labor force include retired, disabled or illness, attending school, and caregiving.[14] As of May 2018, there were 126.3 million age 25-54 (prime working age) persons in the U.S.[15] As of April 2018, about 23 million aged 25-54 persons were outside the labor force (7 million men and 16 million women). The Congressional Budget Office estimated that as of December 2017 about 50% of the age 25-54 men (3.5 million) were outside the labor force due to illness or disability, while about 60% of age 25-54 women (9.6 million) were due to family care-giving.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the U.S. was approximately 2.5 million workers below full employment as of the end of 2015 and 1.6 million at December 31, 2016, mainly due to lower labor force participation.[17] As of May 2018, there were more job openings (6.6 million) than people defined as unemployed (6.0 million) in the U.S.[18][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has defined the basic employment concepts as follows:[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nEmployed persons consist of:\\r\\n\\r\\nFull-time employed persons work 35 hours or more, considering all jobs, while part-time employed persons work less than 35 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho is counted as unemployed?\\r\\n\\r\\nWho is not in the labor force?\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1940s, the U.S Department of Labor, specifically the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), began collecting employment information via monthly household surveys. Other data series are available back to 1912. The unemployment rate has varied from as low as 1% during World War I to as high as 25% during the Great Depression. More recently, it reached peaks of 10.8% in November 1982 and 10.0% in October 2009. Unemployment tends to rise during recessions and fall during expansions. From 1948 to 2015, unemployment averaged about 5.8%. There is always some unemployment, with persons changing jobs and new entrants to the labor force searching for jobs. This is referred to as frictional unemployment. For this reason, the Federal Reserve targets the natural rate of unemployment or NAIRU, which was around 5% in 2015.  A rate of unemployment below this level would be consistent with rising inflation in theory, as a shortage of workers would bid wages (and thus prices) upward.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious sources summarize the number of jobs created by Presidential term. The figures may include private or public job creation or combination. The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database contains the total nonfarm employment level, a measure of private sector job creation. For President Obama, between February 2009 and December 2015, the private sector added a total of 10 million jobs.[24] The Calculated Risk blog also reported the number of private sector jobs created by Presidential term. Over 10 million jobs were created in each of President Clinton's two terms during the 1990s, by far the largest number among recent Presidents. President Reagan averaged over 7 million in each term during the 1980s, while George W. Bush had negative job creation in the 2000s. Each of these Presidents added net public sector (i.e., government) jobs, except President Obama.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore jobs were created in President Obama's last 17 months (3.54 million) than in President Trump's first 17 months (3.22 million), through June 2018.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a variety of measures used to track the state of the U.S. labor market. Each provides insight into the factors affecting employment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides a \\"chartbook\\" displaying the major employment-related variables in the economy.[28][29] Members of the Federal Reserve also give speeches and Congressional testimony that explain their views of the economy, including the labor market.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of September 2017, the employment recovery relative to the November 2007 (pre-recession) level was generally complete. Variables such as the unemployment rates (U-3 and U-6) and number of employed have improved beyond their pre-recession levels. However, measures of labor force participation (even among the prime working age group), and the share of long-term unemployed were worse than pre-crisis levels. Further, the mix of jobs has shifted, with a larger share of part-time workers than pre-crisis. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BLS reported that in 2017, there were approximately 7.5 million persons age 16 and over working multiple jobs, about 4.9% of the population. This was relatively unchanged from 2016. About 4 million (53%) worked a full-time primary job and part-time secondary job.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve tracks a variety of labor market metrics, which affect how it sets monetary policy. One \\"dashboard\\" includes nine measures, only three of which had returned to their pre-crisis (2007) levels as of June 2014.[56][57] The Fed also publishes a \\"Labor market conditions index\\" that includes a score based on 19 other employment statistics.[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch indicates recovery from financial crises can be protracted relative to typical recessions, with lengthy periods of high unemployment and substandard economic growth.[60][61]  Compared against combined financial crises and recessions in other countries, the U.S. employment recovery following the 2007ÿ2009 recession was relatively fast.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nEmployment trends can be analyzed by any number of demographic factors individually or in combination, such as age, gender, educational attainment, and race. A major trend underlying the analysis of employment numbers is the aging of the white workforce, which is roughly 70% of the employment total by race as of November 2016. For example, the prime working age (25ÿ54) white population declined by 4.8 million between December 2007 and November 2016, roughly 5%, while non-white populations are increasing. This is a major reason why non-white and foreign-born workers are increasing their share of the employed. However, white prime-age workers have also had larger declines in labor force participation than some non-white groups, for reasons not entirely clear. Such changes may have important political implications.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nBLS statistics indicate foreign-born workers have filled jobs dis-proportionally to their share in the population. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a variety of domestic, foreign, market and government factors that impact unemployment in the United States. These may be characterized as cyclical (related to the business cycle) or structural (related to underlying economic characteristics) and include, among others:\\r\\n\\r\\nEmployment is both cause and response to the economic growth rate, which can be affected by both government fiscal policy (spending and tax decisions) and monetary policy (Federal Reserve action.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. ran historically large annual debt increases from 2008 to 2013, adding over $1 trillion in total national debt annually from fiscal year 2008 to 2012. The deficit expanded primarily due to a severe financial crisis and recession. With a U.S. GDP of approximately $17 trillion, the spending implied by this deficit comprises a significant amount of GDP. Keynesian economics argues that when the economic growth is slow, larger budget deficits are stimulative to the economy. This is one reason why the significant deficit reduction represented by the fiscal cliff was expected to result in a recession.[92][93]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the deficit from 2014 to 2016 was in line with historical average, meaning it was not particularly stimulative. For example, CBO reported in October 2014: \\"The federal government ran a budget deficit of $486 billion in fiscal year 2014...$195 billion less than the shortfall recorded in fiscal year 2013, and the smallest deficit recorded since 2008. Relative to the size of the economy, that deficitat an estimated 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)was slightly below the average experienced over the past 40 years, and 2014 was the fifth consecutive year in which the deficit declined as a percentage of GDP since peaking at 9.8 percent in 2009. By CBO's estimate, revenues were about 9 percent higher and outlays were about 1 percent higher in 2014 than they were in the previous fiscal year.\\"[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the economic policy of Barack Obama, the United States Congress funded approximately $800 billion in spending and tax cuts via the February 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to stimulate the economy. Monthly job losses began slowing shortly thereafter. By March 2010, employment again began to rise. From March 2010 to September 2012, over 4.3 million jobs were added, with consecutive months of employment increases from October 2010 to December 2015. As of December 2015, employment of 143.2 million was 4.9 million above the pre-crisis peak in January 2008 of 138.3 million.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) has a dual mandate to achieve full employment while maintaining a low rate of inflation. U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate adjustments (monetary policy) are important tools for managing the unemployment rate. There may be an economic trade-off between unemployment and inflation, as policies designed to reduce unemployment can create inflationary pressure, and vice versa.  Debates regarding monetary policy during 2014ÿ2015 centered on the timing and extent of interest rate increases, as a near-zero interest rate target had remained in place since the 2007ÿ2009 recession. Ultimately, the Fed decided to raise interest rates marginally in December 2015.[96] The Fed describes the type of labor market analyses it performs in making interest rate decisions in the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, its policy governing body, among other channels.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has taken significant action to stimulate the economy after the 2007ÿ2009 recession. The Fed expanded its balance sheet significantly from 2008 to 2014, meaning it essentially \\"printed money\\" to purchase large quantities of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. treasury bonds. This bids up bond prices, helping keep interest rates low, to encourage companies to borrow and invest and people to buy homes. It planned to end its quantitative easing in October 2014 but was undecided on when it might raise interest rates from near record lows. The Fed also tied its actions to its outlook for unemployment and inflation for the first time in December 2012.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nLiberals typically argue for government action or partnership with the private sector to improve job creation. Typical proposals involve stimulus spending on infrastructure construction, clean energy investment, unemployment compensation, educational loan assistance, and retraining programs. Liberals historically supported labor unions and protectionist trade policies. Liberals tend to be less concerned with budget deficits and debt and have a higher tolerance for inflation or currency devaluation to improve trade competitiveness, as a weaker currency makes exports relatively less expensive. During recessions, liberals generally advocate solutions based on Keynesian economics, which argues for additional government spending when the private sector is unable or unwilling to support sufficient levels of economic growth.[99][100]\\r\\n\\r\\nConservatives typically argue for free market solutions, with less government restriction of the private sector. Conservatives tend to oppose stimulus spending or bailouts, letting the free market determine success and failure. Typical proposals involve deregulation and income tax rate reduction. Conservatives historically have opposed labor unions and encouraged free trade agreements. Fiscal conservatives express concern that higher budget deficits and debt damage confidence, reducing investment and spending. Conservatives argue for policies that reduce or lower inflation. Conservatives generally advocate supply-side economics.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe affluent are much less inclined than other groups of Americans to support an active role for government in addressing high unemployment. Only 19% of the wealthy say that Washington should insure that everyone who wants to work can find a job, but 68% of the general public support that proposition. Similarly, only 8% of the rich say that the federal government should provide jobs for everyone able and willing to work who cannot find a job in private employment, but 53% of the general public thinks it should. A September 2012 survey by The Economist found those earning over $100,000 annually were twice as likely to name the budget deficit as the most important issue in deciding how they would vote than middle- or lower-income respondents. Among the general public, about 40% say unemployment is the most important issue while 25% say that the budget deficit is.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nA March 2011 Gallup poll reported: \\"One in four Americans say the best way to create more jobs in the U.S. is to keep manufacturing in this country and stop sending work overseas. Americans also suggest creating jobs by increasing infrastructure work, lowering taxes, helping small businesses, and reducing government regulation.\\" Further, Gallup reported that: \\"Americans consistently say that jobs and the economy are the most important problems facing the country, with 26% citing jobs specifically as the nation's most important problem in March.\\" Republicans and Democrats agreed that bringing the jobs home was the number one solution approach, but differed on other poll questions. Republicans next highest ranked items were lowering taxes and reducing regulation, while Democrats preferred infrastructure stimulus and more help for small businesses.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, U.S. sentiment on free trade has been turning more negative. An October 2010 Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll reported that: \\"[M]ore than half of those surveyed, 53%, said free-trade agreements have hurt the U.S. That is up from 46% three years ago and 32% in 1999.\\" Among those earning $75,000 or more, 50% now say free-trade pacts have hurt the U.S., up from 24% who said the same in 1999. Across party lines, income, and job type, 76ÿ95% of Americans surveyed agreed that \\"outsourcing of production and manufacturing work to foreign countries is a reason the U.S. economy is struggling and more people aren't being hired\\".[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pew Center reported poll results in August 2012: \\"Fully 85% of self-described middle-class adults say it is more difficult now than it was a decade ago for middle-class people to maintain their standard of living. Of those who feel this way, 62% say \\"a lot\\" of the blame lies with Congress, while 54% say the same about banks and financial institutions, 47% about large corporations, 44% about the Bush administration, 39% about foreign competition and 34% about the Obama administration.\\"[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe debate around the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the approximately $800 billion stimulus bill passed due to the subprime mortgage crisis, highlighted these views. Democrats generally advocated the liberal position and Republicans advocated the conservative position. Republican pressure reduced the overall size of the stimulus while increasing the ratio of tax cuts in the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese historical positions were also expressed during the debate around the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which authorized the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), an approximately $700 billion bailout package (later reduced to $430 billion) for the banking industry. The initial attempt to pass the bill failed in the House of Representatives due primarily to Republican opposition.[104] Following a significant drop in the stock market and pressure from a variety of sources, a second vote passed the bill in the House.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenator Dick Durbin proposed a bill in 2010 called the \\"Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act\\" that would have reduced tax advantages from relocating U.S. plants abroad and limited the ability to defer profits earned overseas. However, the bill was stalled in the Senate primarily due to Republican opposition. It was supported by the AFL-CIO but opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.[105][106]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Congressional Research Service summarized the bill as follows: \\"Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring ActAmends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) exempt from employment taxes for a 24-month period employers who hire an employee who replaces another employee who is not a citizen or permanent resident of the United States and who performs similar duties overseas; (2) deny any tax deduction, deduction for loss, or tax credit for the cost of an American jobs offshoring transaction (defined as any transaction in which a taxpayer reduces or eliminates the operation of a trade or business in connection with the start-up or expansion of such trade or business outside the United States); and (3) eliminate the deferral of tax on income of a controlled foreign corporation attributable to property imported into the United States by such corporation or a related person, except for property exported before substantial use in the United States and for agricultural commodities not grown in the United States in commercially marketable quantities.\\"[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Barack Obama proposed the American Jobs Act in September 2011, which included a variety of tax cuts and spending programs to stimulate job creation. The White House provided a fact sheet which summarized the key provisions of the $447 billion bill.[108] However, neither the House nor the Senate has passed the legislation as of December 2012. President Obama stated in October 2011: \\"In the coming days, members of Congress will have to take a stand on whether they believe we should put teachers, construction workers, police officers and firefighters back on the job...They'll get a vote on whether they believe we should protect tax breaks for small business owners and middle-class Americans, or whether we should protect tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.\\"[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 2012, there was significant debate regarding approximately $560 billion in tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to go into effect in 2013, which would reduce the 2013 budget deficit roughly in half. Critics argued that with an employment crisis, such fiscal austerity was premature and misguided.[110] The Congressional Budget Office projected that such sharp deficit reduction would likely cause the U.S. to enter recession in 2013, with the unemployment rate rising to 9% versus approximately 8% in 2012, costing over 1 million jobs.[92][93] The fiscal cliff was partially addressed by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unclear whether lowering marginal income tax rates boosts job growth, or whether increasing tax rates slows job creation. This is due to many other variables that impact job creation. Economic theory suggests that (other things equal) tax cuts are a form of stimulus (they increase the budget deficit)[111] and therefore create jobs, much like spending. However, tax cuts as a rule have less impact per additional deficit dollar than spending, as a portion of tax cuts can be saved rather than spent. Since income taxes are primarily paid by higher income taxpayers (the top 1% pay roughly half of them) and these taxpayers tend to save a higher portion of any incremental dollars returned to them via tax cuts than lower income taxpayers, income tax cuts are a less effective form of stimulus than payroll tax cuts, infrastructure investment, and unemployment compensation.[112][113]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne study indicated that tax cuts do create employment growth, particularly tax cuts for the lower earners.[114] However, the historical record indicates that marginal income tax rate changes have little impact on job creation, economic growth or employment.[115][116][117]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) wrote in March 2009: \\"Small business employment rose by an average of 2.3 percent (756,000 jobs) per year during the Clinton years, when tax rates for high-income filers were set at very similar levels to those that would be reinstated under President Obama's budget. But during the Bush years, when the rates were lower, employment rose by just 1.0 percent (367,000 jobs).\\"[119] CBPP reported in September 2011 that both employment and GDP grew faster in the seven-year period following President Clinton's income tax rate increase of 1993, than a similar period after the Bush tax cuts of 2001.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nConservatives typically argue for lower U.S. tax income rates, arguing that it would encourage companies to hire more workers. Liberals have proposed legislation to tax corporations that offshore jobs and to limit corporate tax expenditures.\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. corporate after-tax profits were at record levels during 2012 while corporate tax revenue was below its historical average relative to GDP. For example, U.S. corporate after-tax profits were at record levels during the third quarter of 2012, at an annualized $1.75 trillion.[121] U.S. corporations paid approximately 1.2% GDP in taxes during 2011. This was below the 2.7% GDP level in 2007 pre-crisis and below the 1.8% historical average for the 1990ÿ2011 period.[122] In comparing corporate taxes, the Congressional Budget Office found in 2005 that the top statutory tax rate was the third highest among OECD countries behind Japan and Germany. However, the U.S. ranked 27th lowest of 30 OECD countries in its collection of corporate taxes relative to GDP, at 1.8% vs. the average 2.5%.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nA variety of options for creating jobs exist, but these are strongly debated and often have tradeoffs in terms of additional government debt, adverse environmental impact, and impact on corporate profitability.[124] Examples include infrastructure investment, tax reform, healthcare cost reduction, energy policy and carbon price certainty, reducing the cost to hire employees, education and training, deregulation, and trade policy. Authors Bittle & Johnson of Public agenda explained the pros and cons of 14 job creation arguments frequently discussed, several of which are summarized below by topic. These are hotly debated by experts from across the political spectrum.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany experts advocate infrastructure investment, such as building roads and bridges and upgrading the electricity grid. Such investments have historically created or sustained millions of jobs, with the offset to higher state and federal budget deficits. In the wake of the 2008ÿ2009 recession, there were over 2 million fewer employed housing construction workers.[125] The American Society of Civil Engineers rated U.S. infrastructure a \\"D+\\" on their scorecard for 2013, identifying an estimated $3.6 trillion in investment ideas by 2020.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nCBO estimated in November 2011 that increased investment in infrastructure would create between 1 and 6 jobs per $1 million invested; in other words, a $100 billion investment would generate between 100,000 and 600,000 additional jobs. President Obama proposed the American Jobs Act in 2011, which included infrastructure investment and tax breaks offset by tax increases on high income earners.[127] However, it did not receive sufficient support in the Senate to receive a floor vote.  During late 2015, the House and Senate, in rare bipartisan form, passed the largest infrastructure package in a decade, costing $305 billion over five years, less than the $478 billion in Obama's initial request. He signed the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act into law in December 2015.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nLowering the costs of workers also encourages employers to hire more. This can be done via reducing existing Social Security or Medicare payroll taxes or by specific tax incentives for hiring additional workers. CBO estimated in 2011 that reducing employers' payroll taxes (especially if limited to firms that increase their payroll), increasing aid to the unemployed, and providing additional refundable tax credits to lower-income households, would generate more jobs per dollar of investment than infrastructure.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Obama reduced the Social Security payroll tax on workers during the 2011ÿ2012 period, which added an estimated $100 billion to the deficit while leaving these funds with consumers to spend. The U.S. corporate tax rate is among the highest in the world, although U.S. corporations pay among the lowest amount relative to GDP due to loopholes. Reducing the rate and eliminating loopholes may make U.S. businesses more competitive, but may also add to the deficit.[125] The Tax Policy Center estimated during 2012 that reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% would add $1 trillion to the debt over a decade, for example.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nBusinesses are faced with paying the significant and rising healthcare costs of their employees. Many other countries do not burden businesses, but instead tax workers who pay the government for their healthcare. This significantly reduces the cost of hiring and maintaining the work force.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious studies place the cost of environmental regulations in the thousands of dollars per employee. Americans are split on whether protecting the environment or economic growth is a higher priority. Regulations that would add costs to petroleum and coal may slow the economy, although they would provide incentives for clean energy investment by addressing regulatory uncertainty regarding the price of carbon.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Obama advocated a series of clean energy policies during June 2013. These included: Reducing carbon pollution from power plants; Continue expanding usage of clean energy; raising fuel economy standards; and energy conservation through more energy-efficient homes and businesses.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nRaising the minimum wage would provide households with more money to spend, in an era with record corporate profits and a reluctance of corporations to invest. Critics argue raising employment costs deters hiring. During 2009, the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, or $15,000 per year, below poverty level for some families.[125] The New York Times editorial board wrote in August 2013: \\"As measured by the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, low-paid work in America is lower paid today than at any time in modern memory. If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation or average wages over the past nearly 50 years, it would be about $10 an hour; if it had kept pace with the growth in average labor productivity, it would be about $17 an hour.\\"[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Obama advocated raising the minimum wage during February 2013: \\"The President is calling on Congress to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 in stages by the end of 2015 and index it to inflation thereafter, which would directly boost wages for 15 million workers and reduce poverty and inequality...A range of economic studies show that modestly raising the minimum wage increases earnings and reduces poverty without jeopardizing employment. In fact, leading economists like Lawrence Katz, Richard Freeman, and Laura Tyson and businesses like Costco, Wal-Mart, and Stride Rite have supported past increases to the minimum wage, in part because increasing worker productivity and purchasing power for consumers will also help the overall economy.\\"[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Economist wrote in December 2013: \\"A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...America's federal minimum wage, at 38% of median income, is one of the rich world's lowest. Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage.\\"[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. minimum wage was last raised to $7.25 per hour in July 2009.[135] As of December 2013, there were 21 states with minimum wages above the Federal minimum, with the State of Washington the highest at $9.32. Ten states index their minimum wage to inflation.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour between 2014 and 2016 would reduce employment by an estimated 500,000 jobs, while about 16.5 million workers would have higher pay. A smaller increase to $9.00 per hour would reduce employment by 100,000, while about 7.6 million workers would have higher pay.[137]\\r\\n\\r\\nRegulatory costs on business start-ups and going concerns are significant. Requiring laws to have sunset provisions (end-dates) would help ensure only worthwhile regulations are renewed. New businesses account for about one-fifth of new jobs added. However, the number of new businesses starting each year dropped by 17% after the recession. Inc. magazine published 16 ideas to encourage new startups, including cutting red tape, approving micro-loans, allowing more immigration, and addressing tax uncertainty.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation policy reform could make higher education more affordable and more attuned to job needs. Unemployment is considerably lower for those with a college education. However, college is increasingly unaffordable. Providing loans contingent on degrees focused on fields with worker shortages such as healthcare and accounting would address structural workforce imbalances (i.e., a skills mismatch).[125] Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen stated in 2014: \\"Public funding of education is another way that governments can help offset the advantages some households have in resources available for children. One of the most consequential examples is early childhood education. Research shows that children from lower-income households who get good-quality pre-Kindergarten education are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college as well as hold a job and have higher earnings, and they are less likely to be incarcerated or receive public assistance.\\"[138]\\r\\n\\r\\nIncome inequality, expressed by wage stagnation for middle- and lower-income families coupled with a shift in income growth to the top earners, can adversely affect economic growth, as wealthier families tend to save more. The quality or pay of the job matters, not just creating more jobs. The union movement has declined considerably, one factor contributing to more income inequality and off-shoring. Reinvigorating the labor movement could help create more higher-paying jobs, shifting some of the economic pie back to workers from owners. However, by raising employment costs, employers may choose to hire fewer workers.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating a level playing field with trading partners could help create more jobs in the U.S. Wage and living standard differentials and currency manipulation can make \\"free trade\\" something other than \\"fair trade.\\" Requiring countries to allow their currencies to float freely on international markets would reduce significant trade deficits, adding jobs in developed countries such as the U.S. and Western Europe.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nCBO reported several options for addressing long-term unemployment during February 2012. Two short-term options included policies to: 1) Reduce the marginal cost to businesses of adding employees; and 2) Tax policies targeted towards people most likely to spend the additional income, mainly those with lower income. Over the long-run, structural reforms such as programs to facilitate re-training workers or education assistance would be helpful.[140]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Obama established the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in 2009. The Council released an interim report with a series of recommendations in October 2011. The report included five major initiatives to increase employment while improving competitiveness:\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalyzing the true state of the U.S. labor market is very complex and a challenge for leading economists, who may arrive at different conclusions.[143] For example, the main gauge, the unemployment rate, can be falling (a positive sign) while the labor force participation rate is falling as well (a negative sign). Further, the reasons for persons leaving the labor force may not be clear, such as aging (more people retiring) or because they are discouraged and have stopped looking for work.[144] The extent to which persons are not fully utilizing their skills is also difficult to determine when measuring the level of underemployment.[145]\\r\\n\\r\\nA rough comparison of September 2014 (when the unemployment rate was 5.9%) versus October 2009 (when the unemployment rate peaked at 10.0%) helps illustrate the analytical challenge. The civilian population increased by roughly 10 million during that time, with the labor force increasing by about 2 million and those not in the labor force increasing by about 8 million. However, the 2 million increase in the labor force represents the net of an 8 million increase in those employed, partially offset by a 6 million decline in those unemployed. So is the primary cause of improvement in the unemployment rate due to: a) increased employment of 8 million; or b) the increase in those not in the workforce, also 8 million? Did the 6 million fewer unemployed obtain jobs or leave the workforce?\\r\\n\\r\\nCBO issued a report in February 2014 analyzing the causes for the slow labor market recovery following the 2007ÿ2009 recession. CBO listed several major causes:\\r\\n\\r\\nOne method of analyzing the impact of recessions on employment is to measure the period of time it takes to return to the pre-recession employment peak. By this measure, the 2008ÿ2009 recession was considerably worse than the five other U.S. recessions from 1970 to present. By May 2013, U.S. employment had reached 98% of its pre-recession peak after approximately 60 months.[147] Employment recovery following a combined recession and financial crisis tends to be much longer than a typical recession. For example, it took Norway 8.5 years to return to its pre-recession peak employment after its 1987 financial crisis and it took Sweden 17.8 years after its 1991 financial crisis. The U.S. is recovering considerably faster than either of these countries.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ratio of full-time workers was 86.5% in January 1968 and hit a historical low of 79.9% in January 2010. There is a long-term trend of gradual reduction in the share of full-time workers since 1970, with recessions resulting in a decline in the full-time share of the workforce faster than the overall trend, with partial reversal during recovery periods. For example, as a result of the 2007ÿ2009 recession, the ratio of full-time employed to total employed fell from 83.1% in December 2007 to a trough of 79.9% in January 2010, before steadily rising to 81.6% by April 2016.  Stated another way, the share of part-time employed to total employed rose from 16.9% in December 2007 to a peak of 20.1% in January 2010, before steadily falling to 18.4% in April 2016.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a trend towards more workers in alternative (part-time or contract) work arrangements rather than full-time; the percentage of workers in such arrangements rose from 10.1% in 2005 to 15.8% in late 2015. This implies all of the net employment growth in the U.S. economy (9.1 million jobs between 2005 and 2015) occurred in alternative work arrangements, while the number in traditional jobs slightly declined.[53][90]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimates vary for the number of jobs that must be created to absorb the inflow of persons into the labor force, to maintain a given rate of unemployment. This number is significantly affected by demographics and population growth. For example, economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson estimated this figure at 125,000 jobs per month during 2011.[148]\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomist Paul Krugman estimated it around 90,000 during 2012, mentioning also it used to be higher.[149] One method of calculating this figure follows, using data as of September 2012: U.S. population 314,484,000 x 0.90% annual population growth x 63% of population is working age x 63% work force participation rate / 12 months per year = 93,614 jobs/month. This approximates the Krugman figure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWells Fargo economists estimated the figure around 150,000 in January 2013: \\"Over the past three months, labor force participation has averaged 63.7 percent, the same as the average for 2012. If the participation rate holds steady, how many new jobs are needed to lower the unemployment rate? The steady employment gains in recent months suggest a rough answer. The unemployment rate has been 7.9 percent, 7.8 percent and 7.8 percent for the past three months, while the labor force participation rate has been 63.8 percent, 63.6 percent and 63.6 percent. Meanwhile, job gains have averaged 151,000. Therefore, it appears that the magic number is something above 151,000 jobs per month to lower the unemployment rate.\\"[150] Reuters reported a figure of 250,000 in February 2013, stating sustained job creation at this level would be needed to \\"significantly reduce the ranks of unemployed.\\"[151]\\r\\n\\r\\nFederal Reserve analysts estimated this figure around 80,000 in June 2013: \\"According to our analysis, job growth of more than about 80,000 jobs per month would put downward pressure on the unemployment rate, down significantly from 150,000 to 200,000 during the 1980s and 1990s. We expect this trend to fall to around 35,000 jobs per month from 2016 through the\\r\\nremainder of the decade.\\"[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 41 months from January 2010 to May 2013, there were 19 months where the unemployment rate declined. On average, 179,000 jobs were created in those months. The median job creation during those months was 166,000.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. civilian labor force was approximately 155 million people during October 2012.[8] This was the world's third largest, behind China (795.5 million) and India (487.6 million). The entire European Union employed 228.3 million.[154]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of people receiving Social Security disability benefits (SSDI) increased from 7.1 million in December 2007 to 8.7 million in April 2012, a 22% increase. Recipients are excluded from the labor force. Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley estimated this explained as much as 0.5 of the 2.0 percentage point decline in the U.S. labor-force participation rate during the period.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment can have adverse health effects. One study indicated that a 1% increase in the unemployment rate can increase mortality among working-aged males by 6%.  Similar effects were not noted for women or the elderly, who had lower workforce attachment. The mortality increase was mainly driven by circulatory health issues (e.g., heart attacks).[156]  Another study concluded that: \\"Losing a job because of an establishment closure increased the odds of fair or poor health by 54%, and among respondents with no preexisting health conditions, it increased the odds of a new likely health condition by 83%. This suggests that there are true health costs to job loss, beyond sicker people being more likely to lose their jobs.\\"[157] Extended job loss can add the equivalent of ten years to a persons age.[158]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies have also indicated that worsening economic conditions can be associated with lower mortality across the entire economy, with slightly lower mortality in the much larger employed group offsetting higher mortality in the unemployed group. For example, recessions might include fewer drivers on the road, reducing traffic fatalities and pollution.[158]\\r\\n\\r\\nCBO estimated in December 2015 that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known colloquially as \\"Obamacare\\") would reduce the labor supply by approximately 2 million full-time worker equivalents (measured as a combination of persons and hours worked) by 2025, relative to a baseline without the law. This is driven by the law's health insurance coverage expansions (e.g., subsidies and Medicaid expansion) plus taxes and penalties. With access to individual marketplaces, fewer persons are dependent on health insurance offered by employers.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on October 24, 2017 its projections of job growth by industry and job type over the 2016ÿ2026 period.  Healthcare was the industry expected to add the most jobs, driven by demand from an aging population. The top three occupations were: personal care aides with 754,000 jobs added or a 37% increase; home health aids with 425,600 or 47%; and software developers at 253,400 or 30.5%.[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nBLS also reported that: \\"About 9 out of 10 new jobs are projected to be added in the service-providing sector from 2016 to 2026, resulting in more than 10.5 million new jobs, or 0.8 percent annual growth. The goods-producing sector is expected to increase by 219,000 jobs, growing at a rate of 0.1 percent per year over the projections decade.\\" BLS predicted that manufacturing jobs would decline by over 700,000 over that period.[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. employment statistics are reported by government and private primary sources monthly, which are widely quoted in the news media. These sources use a variety of sampling techniques that yield different measures.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral secondary sources also interpret the primary data released.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FRED database contains a variety of employment statistics organized as data series. It can be used to generate charts or download historical information. Data series include labor force, employment, unemployment, labor force participation, etc. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also releases employment statistics.

During August 2012, it projected that the unemployment rate would be 8.8% in 2013 and 8.7% in 2014. CBO projected the rate would then begin falling steadily to 5.5% by 2018 and remain around that level through 2022. This forecast assumes annual real GDP growth will exceed 3% between 2014 and 2018.[164] During December 2012, Wells Fargo Economics forecast that the unemployment rate would be 7.8% in 2013 and 7.6% in 2014. This forecast assumes real GDP growth would be 1.4% in 2013 and 2.5% in 2014.[165]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) prepares an annual report on those petitioning for trade adjustment assistance, due to jobs lost from international trade. This represents a fraction of jobs actually off-shored and does not include jobs that are placed overseas initially or the collateral impact on surrounding businesses when, for example, a manufacturing plant moves overseas. During 2011, there were 98,379 workers covered by petitions filed with ETA.[166] The figure was 280,873 in 2010,[167] 201,053 in 2009 and 126,633 in 2008.[168]","input":"What was the highest unemployment rate in us history?"},{"output":"October 30, 2009","context":"Pit Bulls & Parolees is an American reality television series on Animal Planet which confronts the misunderstandings of pit bulls, a category of related and oft-stigmatized dog breeds.

It features the Villalobos Rescue Center and was originally located in Agua Dulce, California; however, the organization has relocated to the Greater New Orleans area in Louisiana.\\r\\nIt is the United States' largest pit bull animal shelter.[1]\\r\\nFounder Tia Torres appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on September 24, 2014, and stated that her organization has approximately 400 dogs and that increased viewership has resulted in \\"four times\\" as many dogs being directed to her organization.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPit Bulls & Parolees depicts the day-to-day operations at the Villalobos Rescue Center (VRC) and their efforts to have rescues of abused, neglected, and abandoned dogs adopted. The center's founder, Tia Maria Torres, agreed to be on the show to help pay part of Villalobos' then-$25,000 per month bills. Since moving the entire rescue group, including all the dogs, parolees who wanted to go, and her family to New Orleans, the expenses have tripled. They are now $80,000 per month.[3] The show's main focus is the interaction between Tia, the dogs, her daughters (Tania and Mariah), her adopted twin sons (Kanani and Keli'i), and the eponymous parolees who work for her during daily care, training duties, and pit bull rescue missions.[4]\\r\\nTia states in the show: \\"My mission is to rescue. My hope is that one day I wont have to.\\"\\r\\nIn 2011, Torres had planned to move Villalobos to a small town called Tehachapi, California, around 75 miles north of where it had operated in Agua Dulce. It appeared to be an ideal place for VRC to relocate with the overabundance of Pit Bulls in Kern County and a prison facility in town, with newly released inmates looking for work. VRC secured all the proper permits; yet, at the final moment, Kern County did not grant permission for the rescue to conduct their business in the remote area of \\"Old West Ranch,\\" Tehachapi. Losing all of her personal savings spent on the Tehachapi project and hundreds of man hours, VRC was forced to remain at the Agua Dulce location.\\r\\nAs the rules regarding kennel permits were becoming increasingly strict and expensive in Los Angeles County, the rescue announced on November 13, 2011, that they would be moving the facility out of California in order to survive financially.

Racing to secure as much land as possible, but wanting to avoid conflict amongst themselves, without regard to local differences leaders divided up the continent, the partition of Africa was confirmed in the Berlin Agreement of 1885.[6][7] By 1905, control of almost all African soil was claimed by Western European governments, with the only exceptions being Liberia (which had been settled by African-American former slaves) and Ethiopia (which had successfully resisted colonisation by Italy).[8] Britain and France had the largest holdings, but Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Portugal also had colonies. As a result of colonialism and imperialism, a majority of Africa lost sovereignty and control of natural resources such as gold and rubber. The introduction of imperial policies surfacing around local economies led to the failing of local economies due to an exploitation of resources and cheap labor.[9] Progress towards independence was slow up until the mid-20th century. By 1977, 54 African countries had seceded from European colonial rulers.[10]\\r\\nDuring WWI and WWII, African soldiers were conscripted into imperial militaries.[11] This led to a deeper political awareness and the expectation of greater respect and self-determination, which was left largely unfulfilled.[12] During the 1941 Atlantic Conference, the British and the US leaders met to discuss ideas for the post-war world. One of the provisions added by President Roosevelt was that all people had the right to self-determination, inspiring hope in British colonies.[10]\\r\\nOn February?12,?1941, United States President Franklin?D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met to discuss the postwar world. The result was the Atlantic Charter.[13] It was not a treaty and was not submitted to the British Parliament or the Senate of the United States for ratification, but it turned to be a widely acclaimed document.[14] One of the provisions, introduced by Roosevelt, was the autonomy of imperial colonies. After World War II, the US and the African colonies put pressure on Britain to abide by the terms of the Atlantic Charter. After the war, some British considered African colonies to be childish and immature; British colonisers introduced democratic government at local levels in the colonies. Britain was forced to agree but Churchill rejected universal applicability of self-determination for subject nations. He also stated that the Charter was only applicable to German occupation states, not to the British Empire.[10]\\r\\nFurthermore, colonies such as Nigeria, Senegal and Ghana pushed for self-governance as colonial powers were exhausted by war efforts.[15]\\r\\nFor early African nationalists, decolonization was a moral imperative. In 1945 the Fifth Pan-African Congress demanded the end of colonialism. Delegates included future presidents of Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and national activists.[16]\\r\\nColonial economic exploitation led to European extraction of Ghanas mining profits to shareholders, instead of internal development, causing major local socioeconomic grievances.[17] Nevertheless, local African industry and towns expanded when U-boats patrolling the Atlantic Ocean reduced raw material transportation to Europe.[10] In turn, urban communities, industries and trade unions grew, improving literacy and education, leading to pro-independence newspaper establishments.[10]\\r\\nIndeed, in the 1930s, the colonial powers had cultivated, sometimes inadvertently, a small elite of leaders educated in Western universities and familiar with ideas such as self-determination. In some cases where the road to independence was fought, settled arrangements with the colonial powers were also being placed.[9] These leaders came to lead the struggles for independence, and included leading nationalists such as Jomo Kenyatta (Kenya), Kwame Nkrumah (Gold Coast, now Ghana), Julius Nyerere (Tanganyika, now Tanzania), Lopold Sdar Senghor (Senegal), Nnamdi Azikiwe (Nigeria), and Flix Houphou?t-Boigny (C?te d'Ivoire).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe economic legacy of colonialism is difficult to quantify but is likely to have been negative. Modernisation theory emphasises that colonial powers built infrastructure to integrate Africa into the world economy, however, this was built mainly for extraction purposes. African economies were structured to benefit the coloniser and any surplus was likely to be drained, thereby stifling capital accumulation.[18] Dependency theory suggests that most African economies continued to occupy a subordinate position in the world economy after independence with a reliance on primary commodities such as copper in Zambia and tea in Kenya.[19] Despite this continued reliance and unfair trading terms, a meta-analysis of 18 African countries found that a third of countries experienced increased economic growth post-independence.[18]\\r\\nThe debts of African economies are external and one-sided. While the USA and the UK have gross external debts of 95% and 400% respectively, these debts are balanced by the countries being major lenders.[20] This is not the case for African nations which do not own as many assets or debts to balance the burden. The debt situation in sub-Saharan Africa means that the worlds poorest countries were transferring $3 billion US dollars to developed countries between 1995 and 2000.[21] This is exacerbated by interest and principal arrears which made up over 27% of total external debt for sub-Saharan nations in 1998.[21] This causes two main problems: firstly, servicing the debt means less money is available for importing goods, secondly debt creates uncertainty and risk which puts off investors and reduces business confidence.[22]\\r\\nOver 2,000 distinct languages are spoken in the continent. Along with Africas indigenous dialects - Afro-Asiatic, Kordofanian and Khoisan languages, many colonial languages are spoken today. For example, English is spoken in Ghana, Gambia and Kenya, French in Benin, Burkina-Faso and Cameroon, and Portuguese in Guinea-Bissau, Angola, S?o Tom and Prncipe.[23] Scholars including Dellal (2013), Miraftab (2012) and Bamgbose (2011) have argued that Africas linguistic diversity has been eroded. Language has been used by western colonial powers to divide territories and create new identities which has led to conflicts and tensions between African nations.[24]\\r\\nToday, 93% of South Africa's land is still owned by descendants of white settlers despite the political negotiation of the Native Land Act in 1913.[25][dubious ÿ discuss] King (1990) argued that space is a mode of segregations, creating forms of inclusions and exclusions. Evidence is represented through different architecture designs, and distinct segregation of spaces (Zonification) in cities are still a feature in the colonial present. For example, the new development of the business improvement district in Cape Town portrays a similar image of the colonial era with embedded struggles in class, race, ethnicity and hierarchical differences.[26] Decolonization marks one of the historical moments in which African countries increased its autonomous status from the impetus Western colonial powers. Echoes of the colonial past are still visible in the African society today because Ferguson (2006) stated there are still widespread social stigmas associated with the continent such as phrases of darkness and troubled. The representation of Africa, therefore, reveals the continual Western legacies of the colonial past and the struggles embedded in the countries.\\r\\nFollowing World War II, rapid decolonization swept across the continent of Africa as many territories gained their independence from European colonization.\\r\\nIn August 1941, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met to discuss their post-war goals. In that meeting, they agreed to the Atlantic Charter, which in part stipulated that they would, \\"respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them.\\"[27] This agreement became the post-WWII stepping stone toward independence as nationalism grew throughout Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\nConsumed with post-war debt, European powers were no longer able to afford the resources needed to maintain control of their African colonies. This allowed for African nationalists to negotiate decolonization very quickly and with minimal casualties. Some territories, however, saw great death tolls as a result of their fight for independence.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn May 6, 1957, Ghana (formerly Gold Coast) became the first sub-Saharan African country to gain its independence from European colonization in the twentieth century.[citation needed]\\r\\nStarting as early as the 1945 Pan-African Congress, Gold Coasts American-educated, independence leader Kwame Nkrumah made his focus clear.? In the conferences declaration, he wrote, we believe in the rights of all peoples to govern themselves. We affirm the right of all colonial peoples to control their own destiny. All colonies must be free from foreign imperialist control, whether political or economic.[28]\\r\\nFour years later in 1949, the conflict would ramp up when British troops opened fire on African protesters. ?Riots broke out across the territory and while Nkrumah and other leaders ended up in prison, the event became a catalyst for the independence movement.? After being released from prison, Nkrumah founded the, Convention Peoples Party (CPP), which launched a mass-based campaign for independence with the slogan Self Government Now![29] Heightened nationalism within the country grew their power and the political party widely expanded.? In February of 1951, the Convention People's Party gained political power by winning 34 of 38 elected seats, including one for Nkrumah who was imprisoned at the time.[30] While the movement started with violence, it would end with political cooperation.[citation needed]\\r\\nGold Coast finally gained its independence in 1957, which would become a symbol of the possibilities for colonized Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Algeria, anti-colonialism sentiment grew following World War II until it reached a boiling point. Unlike many territories that gained their independence through a smooth transition, France believed the African colony was important and never met their promise of self-governance in Algeria. As a result the Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN) began a guerrilla-style attack to win their freedom.[31] Lasting more than eight years, the estimated death toll typically falls between 300,000 and 400,000 people.[32] By 1958, the FLN was able to negotiate peace accord with French President Charles de Gaulle and nearly 90% of all Europeans had left the territory.\\r\\nThis table is the arranged by the earliest date of independence in this graph; 58 countries have seceded.","input":"Leader of the first sub saharan african nation to gain independence?"},{"output":"in the 1450s","context":"The Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible, the Mazarin Bible or the B42) was the first major book printed using mass-produced movable metal type in Europe. It marked the start of the \\"Gutenberg Revolution\\" and the age of the printed book in the West. Widely praised for its high aesthetic and artistic qualities,[1] the book has an iconic status. Written in Latin, the Catholic Gutenberg Bible is an edition of the Vulgate, printed by Johannes Gutenberg, in Mainz, in present-day Germany, in the 1450s. Since its publication, 49 copies (or substantial portions of copies) have survived, and they are considered to be among the most valuable books in the world even though no complete copy has been sold since 1978.[2][3]\\r\\nIn March 1455, the future Pope Pius II wrote that he had seen pages from the Gutenberg Bible, being displayed to promote the edition, in Frankfurt. It is not known how many copies were printed, with the 1455 letter citing sources for both 158 and 180 copies.\\r\\nThe 36-line Bible, believed to be the second printed version of the Bible, is also sometimes referred to as a Gutenberg Bible, but is possibly the work of another printer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gutenberg Bible, an edition of the Vulgate, contains the Latin version of the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament. It is mainly the work of Jerome who began his work on the translation in 380 AD, with emendations from the Parisian Bible tradition, and further divergences[4] (the Paris Bible, one of many Bible translations in the Middle Ages, is also known as the \\"Thirteenth-Century Bible\\", \\"Old French Bible\\" or, in French, \\"Bible du XIIIe sicle\\").\\r\\nThe Bible was not Gutenberg's first work.[6] Preparation of the Bible probably began soon after 1450, and the first finished copies were available in 1454 or 1455.[7] It is not known exactly how long the Bible took to print. The first precisely datable printing is the Gutenberg's 31-line Indulgence which is known to already exist on 22 October 1454.[8]\\r\\nGutenberg made three significant changes during the printing process.[9] The first sheets were rubricated by being passed twice through the printing press, using black and then red ink. This was soon abandoned, with spaces being left for rubrication to be added by hand.\\r\\nSome time later, after more sheets had been printed, the number of lines per page was increased from 40 to 42, presumably to save paper. Therefore, pages 1 to 9 and pages 256 to 265, presumably the first ones printed, have 40 lines each. Page 10 has 41, and from there on the 42 lines appear. The increase in line number was achieved by decreasing the interline spacing, rather than increasing the printed area of the page. Finally, the print run was increased, necessitating resetting those pages which had already been printed. The new sheets were all reset to 42 lines per page. Consequently, there are two distinct settings in folios 1-32 and 129-158 of volume I and folios 1-16 and 162 of volume II.[9][10]\\r\\nThe most reliable information about the Bible's date comes from a letter. In March 1455, the future Pope Pius II wrote that he had seen pages from the Gutenberg Bible, being displayed to promote the edition, in Frankfurt.[11] It is not known how many copies were printed, with the 1455 letter citing sources for both 158 and 180 copies. Scholars today think that examination of surviving copies suggests that somewhere between 160 and 185 copies were printed, with about three-quarters on paper and the others on vellum.[12][13] However, some books say that about 180 copies were printed and it took about three years to produce them.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn a legal paper, written after completion of the Bible, Johannes Gutenberg refers to the process as \\"Das Werk der Bcher\\": the work of the books. He had invented the printing press and was the first European to print with movable type,[14] but his greatest achievement was arguably demonstrating that the process of printing actually produced books.\\r\\nMany book-lovers have commented on the high standards achieved in the production of the Gutenberg Bible, some describing it as one of the most beautiful books ever printed. The quality of both the ink and other materials and the printing itself have been noted.[1]\\r\\nThe paper size is 'double folio', with two pages printed on each side (four pages per sheet). After printing the paper was folded once to the size of a single page. Typically, five of these folded sheets (10 leaves, or 20 printed pages) were combined to a single physical section, called a quinternion, that could then be bound into a book. Some sections, however, had as few as four leaves or as many as 12 leaves.[15] Some sections may have been printed in a larger number, especially those printed later in the publishing process, and sold unbound. The pages were not numbered. The technique was not new, since it had been used to make blank \\"white-paper\\" books to be written afterwards. What was new was determining beforehand the correct placement and orientation of each page on the five sheets to result in the correct sequence when bound. The technique for locating the printed area correctly on each page was also new.\\r\\nThe folio size, 307 G 445?mm, has the ratio of 1.45:1. The printed area had the same ratio, and was shifted out of the middle to leave a 2:1 white margin, both horizontally and vertically. Historian John Man writes that the ratio was chosen to be close to the golden ratio of 1.61:1.[6] To reach this ratio more closely the vertical size should be 338?mm, but there is no reason why Gutenberg would let this non-trivial difference of 8?mm go by in a work so detailed in other aspects.\\r\\nA single complete copy of the Gutenberg Bible has 1,286 pages (usually bound in two volumes); with four pages per folio-sheet, 322 sheets of paper are required per copy.[16] The handmade paper used by Gutenberg was of fine quality and was imported from Italy. Each sheet contains a watermark left by the papermold.\\r\\nIn Gutenberg's time, inks used by scribes to produce manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg developed an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but also had a high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating.[17] Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: \\"if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you will see this is a very shiny surface. When you write you use a water based ink, you put your pen into it and it runs off. Now if you print that's exactly what you don't want. One of Gutenberg's inventions was an ink which wasn't ink, it's a varnish. So what we call printer's ink is actually a varnish, and that means it sticks to its surface.\\"[18]\\r\\nThe first part of the Gutenberg idea was using a single, hand-carved character to create identical copies of itself. Cutting a single letter could take a craftsman a day of work. A single page taking 2500 letters made this way was impractical. A less labour-intensive method of reproduction was needed. Copies were produced by stamping the original into an iron plate, called a matrix. A rectangular tube was then connected to the matrix, creating a container in which molten type metal could be poured. Once cooled, the solid metal form was released from the tube. The fundamental innovation is that this matrix can be used to produce many duplicates of the same letter. The result of each molding was a rectangular block of metal with the form of the desired character protruding from the end. This piece of type could be put in a line, facing up, with other pieces of type. These lines were arranged to form blocks of text, which could be inked and pressed against paper, transferring the desired text to the paper.\\r\\nEach unique character requires a master piece of type in order to be replicated. Given that each letter has uppercase and lowercase forms, and the number of various punctuation marks and ligatures (e.g. the sequence 'fi' combined in one character, commonly used in writing) the Gutenberg Bible needed a set of 290 master characters. It seems probable that six pages, containing 15600 characters altogether, would be set at any one moment.[6]\\r\\nThe Gutenberg Bible is printed in the blackletter type styles that would become known as Textualis (Textura) and Schwabacher. The name texture refers to the texture of the printed page: straight vertical strokes combined with horizontal lines, giving the impression of a woven structure. Gutenberg already used the technique of justification, that is, creating a vertical, not indented, alignment at the left and right-hand sides of the column. To do this, he used various methods, including using characters of narrower widths, adding extra spaces around punctuation, and varying the widths of spaces around words.[19][20] He also let the punctuation marks go beyond the vertical line using hanging punctuation, which was used to make the justification of the massive black characters stronger to the eye.\\r\\nInitially the rubrics? the headings before each book of the Bible? were printed, but this practice was quickly abandoned, and gaps were left for rubrication to be added by hand. A guide of the text to be added to each page, printed for use by rubricators, survives.[21]\\r\\nThe spacious margin allowed illuminated decoration to be added by hand. The amount of decoration presumably depended on how much each buyer could or would pay. Some copies were never decorated.[22] The place of decoration can be known or inferred for about 30 of the surviving copies. It is possible that 13 of these copies received their decoration in Mainz, but others were worked on as far away as London.[23] The vellum Bibles were more expensive, and perhaps for this reason tend to be more highly decorated, although the vellum copy in the British Library is completely undecorated.[24]\\r\\nThere has been speculation that the \\"Master of the Playing Cards,\\" an unidentified engraver who has been called \\"the first personality in the history of engraving,\\"[25] was partly responsible for the illumination of the copy held by the Princeton University library. However, all that can be said for certain is that the same model book was used for some of the illustrations in this copy and for some of the Master's illustrated playing cards.[26]\\r\\nAlthough many Gutenberg Bibles have been rebound over the years, nine copies retain fifteenth-century bindings. Most of these copies were bound in either Mainz or Erfurt.[23] Most copies were divided into two volumes, the first volume ending with The Book of Psalms. Copies on vellum were heavier and for this reason were sometimes bound in three or four volumes.[1]\\r\\nThe Bible seems to have sold out immediately, with initial sales to owners as far away as England and possibly Sweden and Hungary.[1][27] At least some copies are known to have sold for 30 florins - about three years' wages for a clerk.[28][29] Although this made them significantly cheaper than manuscript Bibles, most students, priests or other people of ordinary income would have been unable to afford them. It is assumed that most were sold to monasteries, universities and particularly wealthy individuals.[21] At present only one copy is known to have been privately owned in the fifteenth century. Some are known to have been used for communal readings in monastery refectories; others may have been for display rather than use, and a few were certainly used for study.[1] Kristian Jensen suggests that many copies were bought by wealthy and pious laypeople for donation to religious institutions.[24]\\r\\nThe Gutenberg Bible had a profound effect on the history of the printed book. Textually, it also had an influence on future editions of the Bible. It provided the model for several later editions, including the 36 Line Bible, Mentelin's Latin Bible, and the first and third Eggestein Bibles. The third Eggestein Bible was set from the copy of the Gutenberg Bible now in Cambridge University Library. The Gutenberg Bible also had an influence on the Clementine edition of the Vulgate commissioned by the Papacy in the late sixteenth century.[30][31]\\r\\nJoseph Martini, a New York book dealer, found that the Gutenberg Bible held by the library of the General Theological Seminary in New York had a forged leaf, carrying part of Chapter 14, all of Chapter 15, and part of Chapter 16 of the Book of Ezekiel. It was impossible to tell when the leaf had been inserted into the volume. It was replaced in the fall of 1953, when a patron donated the corresponding leaf from a defective Gutenberg second volume which was being broken up and sold in parts.[32] This made it \\"the first imperfect Gutenberg Bible ever restored to completeness.\\"[32] In 1978, this copy was sold for $2.2 million USD to the Wrttembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart, Germany.[33]\\r\\nAs of 2009, 49 Gutenberg Bibles are known to exist, but of these only 21 are complete. Others have pages or even whole volumes missing. In addition, there are a substantial number of fragments, some as small as individual leaves, which are likely to represent about another 16 copies. Many of these fragments have survived because they were used as part of the binding of later books.[27] There are 12 surviving copies on vellum, although only four of these are complete and one is of the New Testament only.\\r\\nCopy numbers listed below are as found in the Incunabula Short Title Catalogue, taken from a 1985 survey of existing copies by Ilona Hubay; the two copies in Russia were not known to exist in 1985, and therefore were not catalogued.\\r\\nOnline images of vol. 1 vol. 2 vol. 3 vol. 4\\r\\nToday, few copies remain in religious institutions, with most now owned by university libraries and other major scholarly institutions. After centuries in which all copies seem to have remained in Europe, the first Gutenberg Bible reached North America in 1847. It is now in the New York Public Library.[81] In the last hundred years, several long-lost copies have come to light, considerably improving the understanding of how the Bible was produced and distributed.[27]\\r\\nIn 1921 a New York rare book dealer, Gabriel Wells, bought a damaged paper copy, dismantled the book and sold sections and individual leaves to book collectors and libraries. The leaves were sold in a portfolio case with an essay written by A. Edward Newton, and were referred to as \\"Noble Fragments\\".[82][83] In 1953 Charles Scribner's Sons, also book dealers in New York, dismembered a paper copy of volume II. The largest portion of this, the New Testament, is now owned by Indiana University. The matching first volume of this copy was subsequently discovered in Mons, Belgium.[12]\\r\\nThe only copy held outside Europe or North America is the first volume of a Gutenberg Bible (Hubay 45) at Keio University in Tokyo. The Humanities Media Interface Project (HUMI) at Keio University is known for its high-quality digital images of Gutenberg Bibles and other rare books.[57] Under the direction of Professor Toshiyuki Takamiya, the HUMI team has made digital reproductions of 11 sets of the bible in nine institutions, including both full-text facsimiles held in the collection of the British Library.[84]\\r\\nThe last sale of a complete Gutenberg Bible took place in 1978, which sold for $2.2 million. This copy is now in Stuttgart.[81] The price of a complete copy today is estimated at $25?35 million.[2][3] Individual leaves now sell for $50,000ÿ$150,000, depending upon condition and the desirability of the page. Eight leaves (Book of Esther) from the fragment owned by the Collection of the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York were sold in June 2015 by Sotheby's for $970,000.\\r\\nA two-volume paper edition of the Gutenberg Bible was stolen from Moscow State University in 2009 and subsequently recovered in a FSB sting operation in 2013.[85] This particular copy had been looted by the Soviet Army after World War II from the Library of the University of Leipzig, Germany, and is estimated to be worth in excess of $20.4 million.","input":"When was the first edition of the bible written?"},{"output":"Andres Bonifacio","context":"The Kartilya ng Katipunan (English: Primer of the Katipunan) served as the guidebook for new members of the organization, which laid out the group's rules and principles.

The Main Event bracelet will feature each suit in the deck in either rubies or black diamonds. In terms of sheer mass, it weighs in at over 160 grams of 14 karat gold and over 35 carats of flawless diamonds.[14]\\r\\nA special platinum bracelet was awarded at the 2012 WSOP to the winner of The Big One for One Drop, Antonio Esfandiari. The event was a $1 million buy-in tournament created as a fundraiser for the One Drop Foundation, a charity established by Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Lalibert.[15]\\r\\nAt first, the bracelets did not have much prestige. Ten-time bracelet winner Doyle Brunson said that his first bracelet \\"didn't mean anything\\" to him and that he did not even pick up two of them.[16]\\r\\nSome professional poker players believe that there are two types of poker players; those who have won a bracelet and those who have not. Those who have belong to an exclusive club.[16] \\"It's impossible to overstate the value of a World Series of Poker gold bracelet to anyone who takes the game seriously,\\" stated World Series of Poker Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack during the 2006 bracelet unveiling. \\"It is the equivalent of winning the Stanley Cup in hockey or the Lombardi Trophy in football.\\"[17]\\r\\nMany professional poker players desire the recognition that is associated with the bracelet. Former Celebrity Poker Showdown host and poker star Phil Gordon said, \\"I want that bracelet more than anything.\\"[18] Freddy Deeb said that he did not appreciate his first bracelet because he did not recognize what it meant. He said his 2007 bracelet, however, \\"means everything to me\\".[19] Jennifer Tilly says that winning her 2005 Women's Championship bracelet was \\"better than an Oscar\\".[16]\\r\\nWhen the World Poker Tour decided to offer a prize to its event champions, they decided to present them with WPT Bracelets. In so doing, WPT Founder, President and CEO Steve Lipscomb said, \\"The championship bracelet has become synonymous with poker as a symbol of achievement and respect, and we are honored to continue the tradition that Benny Binion [the founder of the WSOP] began over 30 years ago.\\"[20]\\r\\nBracelets have not always been awarded for winning events. In 1970, the first WSOP Champion received nothing but a silver cup and whatever cash he won during the event.[21] From 1971ÿ1974, according to Becky Behnen (the daughter of WSOP founder Benny Binion), the winner received an undescribed \\"corny trophy\\".[3] In 1975, the winners received a sterling plate. The following year, 1976, the WSOP started the tradition of issuing bracelets to the event winners.\\r\\nIn 1980 and 1981, one did not have to win a WSOP event to win a gold bracelet. In 1980 and 1981, H.D. \\"Oklahoma Johny\\" Hale and Chip Reese received a gold bracelet for being the \\"Best All Around Player\\" at the WSOP, respectively.[22] These bracelets, however, are not considered in the count of WSOP championship bracelets.\\r\\nIn 2007, Thomas Bihl became the first person to ever win a WSOP bracelet outside Las Vegas, Nevada. Bihl won the S2,500 World Championship H.O.R.S.E. at the World Series of Poker Europe in London, England.[23] Days later, Annette Obrestad became the youngest player to ever win a WSOP bracelet at 18 years, 364 days, also becoming the first woman to win a World Series Main Event (WSOPE).[24] Caesars Entertainment (known until 2010 as Harrah's Entertainment), the owner of the WSOP, considers the WSOP Europe bracelet to be the same in prestige as those awarded every year in Las Vegas.\\r\\nIn 2008, Jesper Hougaard became the first person to have won both a WSOP and WSOPE bracelet.\\r\\nIn 2011, a World Series of Poker bracelet was awarded for the first time to the WSOP Circuit National Championship winner in the 100-qualifier event from May 27ÿ29.[1][25] The following year, the Circuit National Championship moved to New Orleans,[26] where it will also be held in 2013.[27]\\r\\nStarting in 2013, bracelets are also awarded in Australia at the World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific, held at Crown Melbourne.[2]\\r\\nOf the three top WSOP bracelet winners, only Johnny Chan still has them all. He keeps them locked in a vault because they are worth, according to him, \\"millions.\\"[3] Brunson did not pick up two of his. Fourteen-time bracelet winner Phil Hellmuth gave away ten of his. \\"To me,\\" Hellmuth said, \\"the bracelets have always been a really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, because I knew that they represented history.\\"[3]\\r\\nThree-time WSOP Bracelet winner Hamid Dastmalchi and six-time winner Ted Forrest had been playing for four days non-stop at the Mirage when Hamid started to complain about the 1992 Main Event Championship Bracelet he received. Bitter about a dispute with the Binion's Horseshoe, the owners of the WSOP at the time, Hamid told the table that the Binion's \\"say it's worth $5,000, but I'd take $1,500 for it.\\" To which Forrest responded \\"Sold\\" and immediately tossed Hamid $1,500 in chips. Dastmalchi mailed Forrest his bracelet.[28][29] Ted Forrest also reported that three of his five bracelets have been stolen over the years, and that he gave his daughter one.[30]\\r\\nIn November 2010, Peter Eastgate put his main event bracelet up for auction on eBay with a starting bid of $16,000. It eventually sold for $147,500 [31][32] and this money was donated to UNICEF.[33]\\r\\nAs of the end of the 2013 World Series of Poker, 22 players have earned five or more WSOP bracelets.[34] Of those, the top bracelet winners are as follows:\\r\\n(bold = won Main Event)\\r\\nJohnny Moss, with a win at the 1971 WSOP, became the first person to have won multiple lifetime WSOP \\"bracelets\\" (as mentioned above, the first actual bracelet was given in 1976).\\r\\nMoss also was the first person to win five lifetime WSOP bracelets, with a win at the 1975 WSOP.\\r\\nJohnny Chan, with a win in Event No. 25 at the 2005 World Series of Poker, became the first person to win 10 lifetime WSOP bracelets, just a few days before Doyle Brunson won his 10th bracelet in Event No. 31 of that same WSOP.\\r\\nThe first person to win two bracelets in the same WSOP was Johnny Moss at the 1971 WSOP.\\r\\nThe first person to win three bracelets in the same WSOP was Walter \\"Puggy\\" Pearson, at the 1973 WSOP. As of the start of the 2016 WSOP, only five other players have won three bracelets in a single WSOP.\\r\\nBill Boyd and Doyle Brunson are the only players to have won bracelets in four consecutive years (Boyd from 1971 to 1974, and Brunson from 1976 to 1979).\\r\\nIn 2005, the WSOP started hosting Circuit Events at many of their casinos around the country. In order to differentiate these events and to ensure the prestige of the WSOP Bracelet, the circuit events present a ring to the winners. In 2011, the WSOP awarded a bracelet to the winner of the Circuit Event National Championship. The Circuit Event National Championship was an invitation only event that used the standings of players from the various circuit events in determining who was invited.\\r\\nStarting with the 2011 WSOP Circuit, the Circuit National Championship was held as a closed event for participants of various circuit events.\\r\\nStarting in 2012, qualification for the Circuit National Championship was significantly changed. A total of 100 players now receive automatic seats in the National Championship. The winners of each Circuit main event and the highest point earner at each circuit stop receive seats, with the remaining automatic seats filled by the top points earners throughout the Circuit season who are not already qualified. Additionally, the top 100 players in the \\"WSOP World Rankings\\", a points race determined on results in open events of the previous two WSOPs, are eligible to enter. The Circuit qualifiers play the National Championship on a freeroll, while the WSOP World Rankings qualifiers must pay a $10,000 buy-in.[26][27]\\r\\nThe winner of the Circuit National Championship wins a World Series of Poker bracelet.","input":"What is the value of the wsop bracelet?"},{"output":"Forty-three","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2018  was the 63rd edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place for the first time in Portugal following the country's first victory at the 2017 contest in Kiev, Ukraine with the song \\"Amar pelos dois\\", performed by Salvador Sobral. The contest was held at the Altice Arena in Lisbon, and consisted of two semi-finals on 8 and 10 May, and the final on 12 May 2018.[2] The three live shows were hosted by Filomena Cautela, Slvia Alberto, Daniela Ruah and Catarina Furtado.\\r\\n\\r\\nForty-three countries participated in the contest, equalling the record of the 2008 and 2011 editions. Russia returned after their absence from the previous edition, and for the first time since 2011, no country withdrew from the contest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winner was Israel with the song \\"Toy\\", performed by Netta. This was Israel's fourth victory in the contest, following their wins in 1978, 1979, and 1998, and their first top five placing in more than a decade. This edition also saw Cyprus and the Czech Republic achieve the best placing in their Eurovision history, coming in second and sixth place, respectively. Portugal finished in the last place, making this the third time that the host country ranked in the bottom five since 2015. For the first time since the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, Azerbaijan, Romania, and Russia failed to qualify for the final. No countries in the Caucasus region participated in the final for the first time since 2005. The EBU reported that the contest had a worldwide audience of around 186 million viewers, surpassing the 2017 edition by over 4 million.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contest took place for the first time in Portugal, following the country's victory in the 2017 edition with the song \\"Amar pelos dois\\", performed by Salvador Sobral.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Altice Arena in Lisbon is a multi-purpose indoor arena built for the Expo '98 and has a capacity of 20,000 attendees, making it the largest indoor venue in Portugal and among the largest in Europe.[5] It is located in the Parque das Na??es (Park of Nations) riverside district in the northeast of Lisbon, which was completely renovated to host the 1998 world's fair. It is connected by metro to the nearby international airport and by train (Oriente Station) to the rest of the country and Europe.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day of the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 final, it was reported that Portuguese broadcaster Rdio e Televis?o de Portugal (RTP) would accept the challenge of organising the 2018 contest in case of a victory.[7] Following Sobral's triumph, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)'s Executive Supervisor for the Eurovision Song Contest, Jon Ola Sand, issued the hosting invitation to RTP during the winner's press conference.[4] The following day, the director-general of RTP, Nuno Artur Silva, confirmed that the broadcaster would organise the contest in 2018 and mentioned MEO Arena (later renamed Altice Arena) in Lisbon as a likely venue to host the contest.[8] On 15 May 2017, RTP appeared to have confirmed Lisbon as the host city,[9][10] but clarified the following day that no final decision had been taken regarding both the host city and venue.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic requirements to select a host city were set out in a document presented by the EBU to RTP following their win in Kiev:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides Lisbon, other cities signalled their interest in bidding to host the 2018 contest: Braga, Espinho, Faro, Gondomar, Guimar?es, and Santa Maria da Feira.[13][14][15] The mayor of Porto, Rui Moreira, declared he would not be interested in \\"spending millions of euros\\" to host the contest,[11] but he would support a bid from the Metropolitan Area of Porto (Espinho, Gondomar, and Santa Maria da Feira).[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 June 2017, RTP representatives met with the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group at the EBU headquarters in Geneva. During the meeting, RTP officials attended a workshop covering several topics related with hosting the Eurovision Song Contest and learned from the experience of the Ukrainian broadcaster UA:PBC. They also had the opportunity to present their first plans for the 2018 contest, including multiple proposals for the host city and venue.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 July 2017, the EBU and RTP announced that Lisbon had been selected as the host city, overcoming confirmed bids from Braga, Gondomar, Guimar?es, and Santa Maria da Feira.[17] In addition, RTP indicated the Parque das Na??es, where Altice Arena is located, as the site for the shows.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nKey:\\r\\n??? Host venue\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eurovision Village was the official Eurovision Song Contest fan and sponsors area during the event weeks, where it was possible to watch performances by contest participants and local artists, as well as the live shows broadcast from the main venue. It was located in Lisbon's downtown Pra?a do Comrcio (also called Terreiro do Pa?o), a large central square open to the Tagus river.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EuroClub was the venue for the official after-parties and private performances by contest participants. Unlike the Eurovision Village, access to the EuroClub was restricted to accredited fans, delegations, and press. It was located at the \\"Ministerium\\" club, next to the Eurovision Village.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Blue Carpet\\" event, where all the contestants and their delegations are presented before the accredited press and fans, took place on 6 May 2018 at the Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology (MAAT) in Lisbon's Belm district. This preceded the official Opening Ceremony of the 2018 contest, which took place at the nearby Electricity Museum.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme for the contest, All Aboard!, was unveiled on 7 November 2017 in a press conference held at the Lisbon Oceanarium.[37] Its visual design features oceanic motifs that allude to Lisbon and Portugal's location on the Atlantic coast and to the country's seafaring history. Alongside the main emblem, which depicts a stylised seashell, twelve supplemental emblems were designed to symbolise different aspects of a marine ecosystem. The contest's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand remarked that the theme and logos \\"resonate with Lisbon's history and underscore Eurovision's core values, including diversity, very well. The Ocean connects all of us and its variety can provide good inspiration for each of the participating broadcasters that we look forward to seeing in Lisbon next May.\\"[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 January 2018, RTP and EBU announced that the contest would be hosted for the first time by four female presenters, consisting of RTP hosts Slvia Alberto, Filomena Cautela, and Catarina Furtado, together with actress Daniela Ruah.[39] It will be the first time since 2015 that the contest does not feature a male presenter, and the second consecutive year that the presenters are all the same gender.[40][39] It was confirmed on 4 May 2018 that Cautela would host the green room.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blue Carpet opening ceremony was hosted by actress Cludia Semedo, radio host Ins Lopes Gon?alves, actor/TV host Pedro Granger, and actor/director Pedro Penim. Granger and Penim moderated the press conferences, as well.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe draw to determine the allocation of the participating countries into their respective semi-finals took place on 29 January 2018 at 13:00 CET, at Lisbon's City Hall. The thirty-seven semi-finalists had been allocated into six pots, based on historical voting patterns as calculated by the contest's official televoting partner Digame. Drawing from different pots helps to reduce the chance of so-called \\"bloc voting\\" and increase suspense in the semi-finals. The draw also determined which semi-final would be broadcast and voted by each of the six automatic finalist countries (hosts Portugal and Big Five countries France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). The ceremony was hosted by contest presenters Slvia Alberto and Filomena Cautela, and included the passing of a Eurovision insignia from Vitali Klitschko, the Mayor of Kiev (host city of the previous contest), to Fernando Medina, the Mayor of Lisbon.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nRTP released the first details regarding the opening and interval acts for the final on 12 March 2018. The opening act featured Portuguese fado singers Ana Moura and Mariza performing \\"Fado Loucura\\" and \\"Barco Negro\\", respectively, which was followed by a parade of flags introducing the 26 finalist participants, with live music by Portuguese scratching duo Beatbombers. The interval acts included Salvador Sobral, who performed his new single \\"Mano a mano\\" and his Eurovision-winning song \\"Amar pelos dois\\" (the latter in a duet with Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso), and electronic music performances by Branko featuring Sara Tavares (Portuguese representative in 1994), Mayra Andrade and Dino D'Santiago.[44][45][46][47][48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EBU announced on 7 November 2017 that forty-two countries would participate in the contest. Russia confirmed their return after withdrawing from the previous edition, while Macedonia's participation was provisionally blocked by the EBU due to unpaid debts by its national broadcaster.[38][50] However, ten days later, the EBU announced that Macedonia would be allowed to enter the contest, raising the number of participating countries to forty-three, equaling the highest number of participants with the 2008 and 2011 editions.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contest featured two representatives who also previously performed as lead vocalists for the same countries. Alexander Rybak won for Norway in 2009 performing \\"Fairytale\\" and Waylon placed second for the Netherlands in 2014 as part of The Common Linnets performing \\"Calm After the Storm\\".[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contest also featured Jessica Mauboy, representing Australia, after taking part in 2014 as the interval act for the second semi-final, performing \\"Sea of Flags\\".[53] In addition, the contest featured four lead singers previously participating as backing vocalists, two of them for the same countries. Lea Sirk backed for Slovenia in 2014 and off-stage in 2016,[54] and Equinox member Vlado Mihailov backed for Bulgaria in 2017.[55] Cesr Sampson, representing Austria, backed for Bulgaria in 2016 (also as a dancer) and off-stage in 2017. SuRie, representing the United Kingdom, backed for Belgium in 2015 (also as a dancer) and was the musical director again for Belgium in 2017.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first semi-final took place on 8 May 2018 at 20:00 WEST (21:00 CEST).[57]\\r\\nNineteen countries participated in the first semi-final.

The accusations were made after she wore a kimono and buns, as well as Maneki-nekos being shown during the performance.[142][143][144]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe topic was debated on British morning show Good Morning Britain on 14 May 2018 in response,[145] with television presenters Trisha Goddard and Piers Morgan defending Netta by stating that she was simply implementing elements of Japanese culture due to her own appreciation of it. English journalist Rebecca Reid disagreed, arguing \\"It's not a beautiful, loving representation of real Japanese culture. It's a costume\\".[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 January 2018, it had emerged on Russian networking site VK that Ukrainian singer Alekseev had performed a Russian-language version of his EuroFest entry \\"Forever\\" (as Navsegda) in May 2017 in Stavropol ÿ before 1 September 2017, the submission deadline set by the EBU, potentially violating the rules of the contest.[147] Six artists threatened to withdraw from the selection if it were allowed to compete,[148] with Sofi Lapina actually doing so.[149] Alekseev was ultimately allowed to compete by BTRC following a melodic revamp of the song, and went on to win the selection, thus representing Belarus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018.[150] However, on 23 February 2018, it was reported that the EBU had given Alekseev permission to perform his original English-language version of the song at the contest, and he would opt to sing that version of the song in May.[151] A few weeks after that announcement, on 28 March 2018 Alekseev premiered a new official version of his Eurovision entry with a lighter intro and additional choir at the end of the track. He also confirmed that this version would be the one performed in Lisbon.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 29 April 2018, during the first rehearsal of the Czech Republic's performance, singer Mikolas Josef reportedly sustained injuries to his back while rehearsing and was subsequently rushed to hospital. The singer updated his fans on Instagram, stating \\"I can confirm that I got injured during the rehearsal and the situation got worse after several hours. I can't even walk now. Got back from the first hospital and I am now heading to another one\\". He stated that he would, however, \\"perform no matter what\\".[153] Josef performed in the first semi-final on 8 May with a slightly altered performance, owing to his injuries, and ultimately finished 6th in the Grand Final on 12 May, achieving Czech Republic's best result to date. He was also the second Czech contestant to qualify for the Grand Final, the other being Gabriela Gun?kov in 2016.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Chinese broadcast of the first semi-final on Mango TV, both Albania and Ireland were edited out of the show, along with their snippets in the recap of all 19 entries.[154] Albania was skipped due to a ban on television performers displaying tattoos that took effect in January 2018, while Ireland was censored due to its representation of a homosexual couple on-stage.[155] In addition, the LGBT flag and tattoos on other performers were also blurred out from the broadcast.[156] As a result, the EBU has terminated its partnership with Mango TV, citing that censorship \\"is not in line with the EBU's values of universality and inclusivity and its proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music,\\" which led to a ban on televising the second semi-final and the grand final in the country.[136][157] A spokesperson for the broadcaster's parent company Hunan TV said they \\"weren't aware\\" of the edits made to the programme.[158] Ireland's representative, Ryan O'Shaughnessy told the BBC in an interview, \\"they haven't taken this lightly and I think it's a move in the right direction, so I'm happy about it.\\"[156]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performance of SuRie, representing the United Kingdom, in the final was disrupted by a man who rushed onto the stage and grabbed her microphone, reportedly shouting \\"Modern Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom! War is not peace.\\"[why?][159][160] The man, later identified as 'Dr ACactivism', a political activist from London,[161] climbed into a camera run to get access to the stage.[162] SuRie was able to complete her performance, and after the song the broadcast cut to an unscheduled interview in the green room.[163][164] The EBU offered SuRie and her team the opportunity to perform again, but she declined.[159] SuRie later revealed that she had suffered several bruises on her right hand.[165]  For official release on YouTube, Eurovision edited out the interrupted performance and substituted SuRie's Jury Night performance from the previous evening.  The official video retains the unscheduled green room interview with the Ukrainian delegation that followed the stage invasion. The official DVD release also replaces the grand final performance with the previous evenings jury show performance.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the main winner's trophy, the Marcel Bezen?on Awards and the Barbara Dex Award will be contested during the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. Additionally, the OGAE voting poll took place before the final.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marcel Bezen?on Awards were first handed out during the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 in Tallinn, Estonia, honouring the best competing songs in the final. Founded by Christer Bj?rkman (Sweden's representative in the Eurovision Song Contest 1992 and the current Head of Delegation for Sweden) and Richard Herrey (a member of the Herreys and the Eurovision Song Contest 1984 winner from Sweden), the awards are named after the creator of the annual competition, Marcel Bezen?on.[166] The awards are divided into three categories: Press Award, Artistic Award, and Composer Award.

Two former prime ministersSir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and Sir Mackenzie Bowellserved in the 1890s while members of the Senate.[11] Both, in their roles as Government Leader in the Senate, succeeded prime ministers who had died in officeJohn A. Macdonald in 1891 and John Sparrow David Thompson in 1894. That convention has since evolved toward the appointment of an interim leader from the commons in such a scenario.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrime ministers who are not Members of Parliament upon their appointment (or who lose their seats while in office) have since been expected to seek election to the commons as soon as possible. For example, William Lyon Mackenzie King, after losing his seat in the 1925 federal election (that his party won), briefly \\"governed from the hallway\\" before winning a by-election a few weeks later. Similarly, John Turner replaced Pierre Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in 1984 and subsequently was appointed prime minister while not holding a seat in the House of Commons; Turner won a riding in the next election but the Liberal Party was swept from power. Turner was the last serving prime minister to not hold a commons seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould a serving prime minister today lose his or her seat in the legislature, or should a new prime minister be appointed without holding a seat, the typical process that follows is that a junior member in the governing political party will resign to allow the prime minister to run in the resulting by-election.[11] A safe seat is usually chosen; while the Liberal and Conservative parties traditionally observed a convention of not running a candidate against another party's new leader in the by-election, the New Democrats and smaller political parties typically do not follow the same convention. However, if the governing party selects a new leader shortly before an election is due, and that new leader is not a member of the legislature, he or she will normally await the upcoming election before running for a seat in parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a poll conducted by Ipsos-Reid following the first prorogation of the 40th parliament on December 4, 2008, it was found that 51% of the sample group thought the prime minister was directly elected by Canadians.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian prime minister serves at Her Majesty's pleasure, meaning the post does not have a fixed term. Once appointed and sworn in by the governor general, the prime minister remains in office until he or she resigns, is dismissed, or dies.[14] The lifespan of parliament was limited by the constitution to five years and, though the governor general may still, on the advice of the prime minister, dissolve parliament and issue the writs of election prior to the date mandated by the Canada Elections Act; the KingÿByng Affair was the only time since Confederation that the governor general deemed it necessary to refuse his prime minister's request for a general vote. As of 2007, with an amendment to the Elections Act, Section 56.1(2) was changed to limit the term of a majority government to four years, with election day being set as the third Monday in October of the fourth calendar year after the previous polling date.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing parliamentary dissolution, the prime minister must run in the resulting general election if he or she wishes to maintain a seat in the House of Commons. Should the prime minister's party subsequently win a majority of seats in the House of Commons, it is unnecessary to re-appoint the prime minister or again swear him or her into office.[14] If, however, an opposition party wins a majority of seats, the prime minister may resign or be dismissed by the governor general. Should the prime minister's party achieve a minority while an opposition party wins a plurality (i.e., more seats than any other party but less than a majority), the prime minister can attempt to maintain the confidence of the House by forming a coalition with other minority parties. This option was last entertained in 1925.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the prime minister is, in practice, the most politically powerful member of the Canadian government, he or she is sometimes erroneously referred to as Canada's head of state,[n 2] when, in fact, that post is held by the Canadian monarch, represented by the governor general.[16] The prime minister is, instead, the head of government and is responsible for advising the Crown on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative and its executive powers,[3] which are governed by the constitution and its conventions. However, the function of the prime minister has evolved with increasing power. Today, as per the doctrines of constitutional monarchy, the advice given by the prime minister is ordinarily binding, meaning the prime minister effectively carries out those duties ascribed to the sovereign or governor general, leaving the latter to act in predominantly ceremonial fashions.[17] As such, the prime minister, supported by the Office of the Prime Minister (PMO), controls the appointments of many key figures in Canada's system of governance, including the governor general, the Cabinet, justices of the Supreme Court, senators, heads of crown corporations, ambassadors to foreign countries, the provincial lieutenant governors, and approximately 3,100 other positions. Further, the prime minister plays a prominent role in the legislative processwith the majority of bills put before parliament originating in the Cabinetand the leadership of the Canadian Armed Forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nPierre Trudeau is credited with, throughout his tenure as prime minister between 1968 and 1984, consolidating power in the PMO,[18] which is itself filled by political and administrative staff selected at the prime minister's discretion and unaccountable to parliament. At the end of the 20th century and into the 21st, analystssuch as Jeffrey Simpson,[19] Donald Savoie, Andrew Coyne,[20] and John Gomeryargued that both parliament and the Cabinet had become eclipsed by prime ministerial power;[n 3][21] Savoie wrote: \\"The Canadian prime minister has little in the way of institutional check, at least inside government, to inhibit his ability to have his way.\\"[22] Indeed, the position has been described as undergoing a \\"presidentialisation\\",[18][23] to the point that its incumbents publicly outshine the actual head of state (and prime minister's spouses are sometimes called the \\"First Lady of Canada\\"[24][25]).[26][27] Former governor general Adrienne Clarkson alluded to what she saw as \\"an unspoken rivalry\\" that had developed between the prime minister and the Crown.[28] It has been theorized that such is the case in Canada as its parliament is less influential on the executive than in other countries with Westminster parliamentary systems; particularly, Canada has fewer MPs, a higher turnover rate of MPs after each election, and an Americanised system for selecting political party leaders, leaving them accountable to the party membership rather than caucus, as is the case in the United Kingdom.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere do exist checks on the prime minister's power: the commons may revoke its confidence in an incumbent prime minister and Cabinet or caucus revolts can quickly bring down a serving premier and even mere threats of such action can persuade or compel a prime minister to resign his post, as happened with Jean Chrtien. The Reform Act, 2014,[30] codifies the process by which a caucus may trigger a party leadership review and, if necessary, chose an interim leader, thereby making a prime minister more accountable to the MPs in his or her party. Caucuses may choose to follow these rules, though the decision would be made by recorded vote, thereby subjecting the party's choice to public scrutiny.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Senate may delay or impede legislation put forward by the Cabinet, such as when Brian Mulroney's bill creating the Goods and Services Tax (GST) came before the upper chamber and, given Canada's federal nature, the jurisdiction of the federal government is limited to areas prescribed by the constitution. Further, as executive power is constitutionally vested in the monarch, meaning the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of its ministers,[32][33][34] the sovereign's supremacy over the prime minister in the constitutional order is thus seen as a \\"rebuff to the pretensions of the elected: As it has been said, when the Prime Minister bows before the Queen, he bows before us [the Canadian people].\\"[35][36] Either the sovereign or his or her governor general may therefore oppose the prime minister's will in extreme, crisis situations.[n 4] Near the end of her time as governor general, Adrienne Clarkson stated: \\"My constitutional role has lain in what are called 'reserve powers': making sure that there is a prime minister and a government in place, and exercising the right 'to encourage, to advise, and to warn'[...] Without really revealing any secrets, I can tell you that I have done all three.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo official residences are provided to the prime minister24 Sussex Drive in Ottawa and Harrington Lake, a country retreat in Gatineau Parkas well an office in the Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council (formerly known as Langevin Block), across from Parliament Hill.[38] For transportation, the prime minister is granted an armoured car and shared use of two official aircrafta CC-150 Polaris for international flights and a Challenger 601 for domestic trips. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also furnish constant personal security for the prime minister and his or her family. All of the aforementioned is supplied by the Queen-in-Council through budgets approved by parliament, as is the prime minister's total annual compensation of CAD$347,400.[1] The Prime Minister's total compensation consists of the Member of the House of Commons Basic Sessional Indemnity of CAD$172,400, the Prime Minister Salary of CAD$172,400, and the Prime Minister Car Allowance of CAD$2000.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nShould a serving or former prime minister die, he or she is accorded a state funeral, wherein their casket lies in state in the Centre Block of Parliament Hill.[39] Only Bowell and the Viscount Bennett were given private funerals, Bennett also being the only former Prime Minister of Canada to die and be buried outside the country and Bowell the only whose funeral was not attended by politicians. John Thompson also died outside Canada, at Windsor Castle, where Queen Victoria permitted his lying-in-state before his body was returned to Canada for a state funeral in Halifax.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn earlier years, it was traditional for the monarch to bestow a knighthood on newly appointed Canadian prime ministers. Accordingly, several carried the prefix Sir before their name; of the first eight premiers of Canada, only Alexander Mackenzie refused the honour of a knighthood from Queen Victoria. Following the 1919 Nickle Resolution, however, it was against non-binding policy for the sovereign to grant such honorific titles to Canadians; the last prime minister to be knighted was Sir Robert Borden, who was premier at the time the Nickle Resolution was debated in the House of Commons. Still, Bennett was in 1941, six years after he stepped down as prime minister, elevated to the peerage by King George VI as Viscount Bennett, of Mickleham in the County of Surrey and of Calgary and Hopewell in the Dominion of Canada.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian Heraldic Authority (CHA) has granted former prime ministers an augmentation of honour on the personal coat of arms of those who pursued them. The heraldic badge, referred to by the CHA as the mark of the Prime Ministership of Canada,[43] consists of four red maple leaves joined at the stem on a white field (\\"Argent four maple leaves conjoined in cross at the stem Gules\\"); the augmentation has, so far, been granted either as a canton sinister or centred in the chief.[43][44][45][46][47] To date, former prime ministers Joe Clark,[43] Pierre Trudeau,[44] John Turner,[45] Brian Mulroney,[46] and Kim Campbell were granted arms with the augmentation.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada continues the Westminster tradition of using the title Prime Minister when one is speaking to the federal head of government directly; this is in contrast to the United States protocol of addressing the federal head of government as mister (as in, Mister President); the Department of Canadian Heritage advises that it is incorrect to use the term Mr Prime Minister.[48] The written form of address for the prime minister should use his or her full parliamentary title: The Right Honourable [name], [post-nominal letters], Prime Minister of Canada. However, while in the House of Commons during Question Period, other members of parliament may address the prime minister as The Right Honourable, Member for [prime minister's riding] or simply The Right Honourable Prime Minister.[49] Former prime ministers retain the prefix The Right Honourable for the remainder of their lives; should they remain sitting MPs, they may be referred as The Right Honourable Member for [member's riding] or by their portfolio title (if appointed to one), as in The Right Honourable Minister of National Defence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the decades following Confederation, it was common practice to refer to the prime minister as Premier of Canada,[50][51][52] a custom that continued until the First World War, around the time of Robert Borden's premiership.[53][54][55] While contemporary sources will still speak of early prime ministers of Canada as premier,[56][57][58] the modern practice is such that the federal head of government is known almost exclusively as the prime minister, while the provincial heads of government are termed premiers (save for within Quebec and New Brunswick, where the premiers are addressed in French as Premier ministre du [province], literally translated as Prime Minister of [province]).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Ministerÿdesignate of Canada refers to the person who has been designated as the future prime minister by the Governor General, after either winning a general election, forming a confidence and supply government, or forming an coalition government. The term does not apply to incumbent prime ministers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter exiting office, former prime ministers of Canada have engaged in various pursuits. Some remained in politics: Bowell continued to serve as a senator, Stephen Harper returned to the House of Commons as a backbench Member of Parliament, and Bennett moved to the United Kingdom after being elevated to the House of Lords.[59] A number led Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition in the Canadian parliament: John A. Macdonald, Arthur Meighen, Mackenzie King,[60] and Pierre Trudeau, all before being re-appointed as prime minister (Mackenzie King twice); Alexander Mackenzie and John Diefenbaker, both prior to sitting as regular Members of Parliament until their deaths;[61] Wilfrid Laurier dying while still in the post;[62] and Charles Tupper,[63] Louis St. Laurent,[64] and John Turner, each before they returned to private business. Meighen was also appointed to the Senate following his second period as prime minister, but resigned his seat to seek re-election and moved to private enterprise after failing to win a riding.[65] Following Meighen into civilian life were: Robert Borden, who served as Chancellor of Queen's and McGill Universities, as well as working in the financial sector; Lester B. Pearson, who acted as Chancellor of Carleton University;[66] Joe Clark and Kim Campbell, who became university professors, Clark also consultant and Campbell working in international diplomacy and as the director of private companies and chairperson of interest groups; while Pierre Trudeau and Jean Chrtien returned to legal practice.[67] Former prime ministers also commonly penned autobiographiesTupper,[63] for exampleor published their memoirssuch as Diefenbaker and Paul Martin.[61]","input":"How long does a canadian prime minister stay in office?"},{"output":"Egypt","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest recorded systems of weights and measures originate in the 3rd or 4th millennium BC. Even the very earliest civilizations needed measurement for purposes of agriculture, construction, and trade. Early standard units might only have applied to a single community or small region, with every area developing its own standards for lengths, areas, volumes and masses. Often such systems were closely tied to one field of use, so that volume measures used, for example, for dry grains were unrelated to those for liquids, with neither bearing any particular relationship to units of length used for measuring cloth or land. With development of manufacturing technologies, and the growing importance of trade between communities and ultimately across the Earth, standardized weights and measures became critical. Starting in the 18th century, modernized, simplified and uniform systems of weights and measures were developed, with the fundamental units defined by ever more precise methods in the science of metrology. The discovery and application of electricity was one factor motivating the development of standardized internationally applicable units. \\r\\n\\r\\nWeights and measures have taken a great variety of forms over the course of history, from simple informal expectations in barter transactions to elaborate state and supranational systems that integrate measures of many different kinds.  Weights and measures from the oldest societies can often be inferred at least in part from archaeological specimens, often preserved in museums.[citation needed] The comparison of the dimensions of buildings with the descriptions of contemporary writers is another source of information. An interesting example of this is the comparison of the dimensions of the Greek Parthenon with the description given by Plutarch from which a fairly accurate idea of the size of the Attic foot is obtained. Because of the comparative volume of artifacts and documentation, we know much more about the state-sanctioned measures of large, advanced societies than we do about those of smaller societies or about the informal measures that often coexisted with official ones throughout history. In some cases, we have only plausible theories and we must sometimes select the interpretation to be given to the evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy studying the evidence given by all available sources, and by correlating the relevant facts, we obtain some idea of the origin and development of the units. We find that they have changed more or less gradually with the passing of time in a complex manner because of a great variety of modifying influences.[citation needed] It is possible to group official measurement systems for large societies into historical systems that are relatively stable over time, including: the Babylonian system, the Egyptian system, the Phileterian system of the Ptolemaic age, the Olympic system of Greece, the Roman system, the British system, and the metric system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known uniform systems of weights and measures seem all to have been created at some time in the 4th and 3rd millennia BC among the ancient peoples of Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, and perhaps also Elam (in Iran) as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Babylonian and Egyptian records and the Hebrew Bible indicate that length was first measured with the forearm, hand, or finger and that time was measured by the periods of the sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies. When it was necessary to compare the capacities of containers such as gourds or clay or metal vessels, they were filled with plant seeds which were then counted to measure the volumes. When means for weighing were invented, seeds and stones served as standards. For instance, the carat, still used as a unit for gems, was derived from the carob seed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Egyptian cubit, the Indus Valley units of length referred to above and the Mesopotamian cubit were used in the 3rd millennium BC and are the earliest known units used by ancient peoples to measure length. The units of length used in ancient India included the dhanus, or dhanush (bow), the krosa (cry, or cow-call) and the yojana (stage).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common cubit was the length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. It was divided into the span of the hand or the length between the tip of little finger to the tip of the thumb (one-half cubit), the palm or width of the hand (one sixth), and the digit or width of the middle finger (one twenty-fourth).  The Royal Cubit, which was a standard cubit enhanced by an extra palmthus 7 palms or 28 digits longwas used in constructing buildings and monuments and in surveying in ancient Egypt.  The inch, foot, and yard evolved from these units through a complicated transformation not yet fully understood. Some believe they evolved from cubic measures; others believe they were simple proportions or multiples of the cubit. In whichever case, the Greeks and Romans inherited the foot from the Egyptians. The Roman foot (~296?mm) was divided into both 12 unciae (inches) (~24.7?mm) and 16 digits (~18.5?mm). The Romans also introduced the mille passus (1000 paces) or double steps, the pace being equal to five Roman feet (~1480?mm). The Roman mile of 5000 feet (1480 m) was introduced into England during the occupation. Queen Elizabeth I (reigned from 1558 to 1603) changed, by statute, the mile to 5280 feet (~1609 m) or 8 furlongs, a furlong being 40 rod (unit)s (~201 m) of 5.5 yards (~5.03 m) each.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction of the yard (0.9144 m) as a unit of length came later, but its origin is not definitely known. Some believe the origin was the double cubit, others believe that it originated from cubic measure. Whatever its origin, the early yard was divided by the binary method into 2, 4, 8, and 16 parts called the half-yard, span, finger, and nail. The association of the yard with the \\"gird\\" or circumference of a person's waist or with the distance from the tip of the nose to the end of the thumb of King Henry I (reigned 1100ÿ1135) are probably standardizing actions, since several yards were in use in Britain.\\r\\nThere were also Rods, Poles and Perches for measurements of length. The following table lists the equivalents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grain was the earliest unit of mass and is the smallest unit in the apothecary, avoirdupois, Tower, and troy systems. The early unit was a grain of wheat or barleycorn used to weigh the precious metals silver and gold. Larger units preserved in stone standards were developed that were used as both units of mass and of monetary currency. The pound was derived from the mina used by ancient civilizations.  A smaller unit was the shekel, and a larger unit was the talent. The magnitude of these units varied from place to place. The Babylonians and Sumerians had a system in which there were 60 shekels in a mina and 60 minas in a talent. The Roman talent consisted of 100 libra (pound) which were smaller in magnitude than the mina. The troy pound (~373.2 g) used in England and the United States for monetary purposes, like the Roman pound, was divided into 12 ounces, but the Roman uncia (ounce) was smaller. The carat is a unit for measuring gemstones that had its origin in the carob seed, which later was standardized at 1/144 ounce and then 0.2?gram.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoods of commerce were originally traded by number or volume.  When weighing of goods began, units of mass based on a volume of grain or water were developed. The diverse magnitudes of units having the same name, which still appear today in our dry and liquid measures, could have arisen from the various commodities traded.  The larger avoirdupois pound for goods of commerce might have been based on volume of water which has a higher bulk density than grain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stone, quarter, hundredweight, and ton were larger units of mass used in Britain.  Today only the stone continues in customary use for measuring personal body weight.  The present stone is 14 pounds (~6.35?kg), but an earlier unit appears to have been 16 pounds (~7.25?kg).  The other units were multiples of 2, 8, and 160 times the stone, or 28, 112, and 2240 pounds (~12.7?kg, 50.8?kg, 1016?kg), respectively.  The hundredweight was approximately equal to two talents.  The ton of 2240 pounds is called the \\"long ton\\".  The \\"short ton\\" is equal to 2000 pounds (~907?kg).  A tonne (t) is equal to 1000?kg.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe division of the circle into 360 degrees and the day into hours, minutes, and seconds can be traced to the Babylonians who had sexagesimal system of numbers.  The 360 degrees may have been related to a year of 360 days.  Many other systems of measurement divided the day differently -- counting hours, decimal time, etc. Other calendars divided the year differently.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe metric system was first described in 1668 and officially adopted by France in 1799.  Over nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it became the dominant system worldwide, although several countries, including the United States and China, continue to use their customary units. Among the numerous customary systems, many have been adapted to become an integer multiple of a related metric unit: The Scandinavian mile is now defined as 10?km, the Chinese jin is now defined as 0.5?kg, and the Dutch ons is now defined as 100?g. The American system is unusual in that its units have not been adapted in such a manner.","input":"Who used the first standardized system of measurement?"},{"output":"James Quincey","context":"Tarsus American College\\r\\nUniversity of Hull\\r\\nAhmet Muhtar Kent (born 1952) is a Turkish-American business executive.

France and Great Britain spent 1.3 billion livres and 250 million pounds, respectively. The United States spent $400 million in wages for its troops. Spain increased its military spending from 454 million reales in 1778 to over 700 million reales in 1779.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic warfare between Great Britain and the colonists began well before the colonies declared their independence in 1776. Regulations from the crown were met with fierce opposition from the colonists.  After lobbies and petitions proved ineffective, the colonists turned to boycotting imported English goods.  Boycotting proved to be successful in crippling British trade.[1]   After the first colonial boycott in 1765, Parliament overturned the Sugar and Stamp Acts, and after a second boycott in 1768 Parliament overturned all of the Townshend duties except for the tax on tea.[2] The colonists persisted, and the American boycott on tea ultimately culminated in the Boston Tea Party of 1773. Despite the Revolution's widespread association with the colonists' aversion to higher taxes, it has been claimed that the colonists actually paid far less tax compared to their British counterparts.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish efforts to weaken the colonies included isolating their economy from the rest of the world by cutting off trade.  With a navy that was many times more powerful than its American counterpart, the English had complete  control over the American ports.[4]   The British took control of major port cities along the colonial east coast, and as a result British warships were able to drastically reduce the number of ships that could successfully travel from the colonies.  Consequently, the U.S. saw a fall in exported goods due to the relentless British blockade.[5]   Furthermore, Englands naval strength was great enough to intimidate other nations and scare them away from exporting goods to the colonies, so smuggled and inexpensive imports became costly and rare.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Continental Army under the direction of George Washington sought to engage in a war of attrition.[7]   Because the fight was on colonial soil, Washington aimed to take advantage of the lack of trade with Great Britain by cutting them off from necessary resources, hoping that eventually the redcoat army in North America would grow sick and tired.  Under the Articles of Confederation, however, the Continental Congress did not have the power to impose taxes or regulate commerce in the colonies, and thus could not generate the sufficient funds for a war of attrition.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo solve this problem, the Continental Congress sent diplomats including Benjamin Franklin to Europe in search of foreign support for the American cause.  For the first two years of war, the colonists received secretive private and public loans from the French, who held a lingering resentment for the British after the Seven Years' War.[9]   After the British defeat at Saratoga, however, foreign support for the Continental Army increased, and in 1778 the colonies signed a treaty with France, officially bringing them into the war with England.[10]   By the end of the war, the colonies had received loans from several different European nations, including significant contribution from France, Spain and the Netherlands.  In addition, the colonies received much private funding, most notably from the Marquis de Lafayette and the Baron of Kalb, both Frenchmen.[11]   This funding ultimately enabled them to fight the war of attrition that General Washington hoped for.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the French possessed a powerful navy, their entrance into the war weakened the British blockade on colonial ports and further cut off the British army from its Atlantic supply route.[12]   The British forces recognized that they would not last long without shipping in supplies, so in retaliation, the British redeployed some of their forces to the French Caribbean.  Their hope was to capture French sugar islands and cut the French financial supply line.[13]   The new war in the Caribbean added to Englands already large financial costs, yet unlike the colonies, the British were not successful in their attempts to garner foreign loans or armaments.  Without economic assistance from other nations, the financial strain on Parliament and British taxpayers became increasingly burdensome, and ultimately had a hand in wearing down the British forces and ending the war for independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the war progressed, the Americans deteriorating financial stability quickly became Britains greatest asset.  Because it did not possess the power to tax the colonists, the Continental Congress printed money at a rapid rate to fund the armys expenses and pay off its loans from foreign nations.[14]   As a result, the colonies experienced severe inflation and depreciation of the Continental dollar.  The colonists also had great difficulty in financing a wartime effort against the British southern campaign, not effectively halting the British destruction until the battle of Yorktown in 1781.  When war ended in 1783, American negotiations, monetary policies and government restructuring all contributed to paying off the American national debt.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Revolutionary War took a heavy toll on Great Britain. The average cost for the war was S12 million a year. The British ended the war with a national debt of S250 million, which generated a yearly interest of over S9.5 million (3.8 percent). This debt piled on to the already outstanding debt from the Seven Years' War. Taxes on the British population increased over the years and duties on some items such as glass and lead were also added, the average tax for the British public being four shillings in every pound (20 percent).[16] Furthermore, the Royal Navy was not able to 'rule the waves' as it had done in the Seven Years' War.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat Britain's trade with the thirteen American colonies fell apart once the American Revolution started, causing British businessmen, especially from the tobacco industry, to suffer. Income from the sale of woolen and metal products dropped sharply and export markets dried up. British merchant sailors also felt the pinch: it is estimated that 3,386 British merchant ships were seized by enemy forces during the war.[18] However, Royal Navy warships did make up these losses somewhat, due to their own privateering efforts on enemy shipping, particularly Spanish and French merchant ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the war, France shouldered a financial burden similar to that of Great Britain, as debt from the American Revolutionary War was piled upon already existing debts from the Seven Years' War. The French spent 1.3 billion livres on war costs. When the war ended, France had accumulated a debt of 3,315.1 million livres,[19] a fortune at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe debt caused major economic and political problems for France, and, as the country struggled to pay its debts, eventually led to the Financial Crisis of 1786[20] and the French Revolution in 1789.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpain's economic losses were not as great as those of the other belligerents in the American Revolutionary War. This was because Spain paid off her debts quickly and efficiently. However, Spain had nearly doubled her military spending during the war, from 454 million reales in 1778 to over 700 million reales in 1779.[22] Spain's revenue loss was similar to Britain's, since she lost a lot of income from her American colonies due to the war. To make up for the shortfall, Spanish governors introduced higher tax rates in the South American colonies, with little success.[citation needed] Spain's next move was to issue royal bonds to her colonies, also with limited success.[citation needed] Finally, in 1782 the first national bank of Spain ÿ the Banco San Carlo ÿ was created to improve and centralize the economic situation.[vague]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more details on the impact on the United States, see Economic history of the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thirteen American states flourished economically at the beginning of the war.[23] The colonies could trade freely with the West Indies and other European nations, instead of just Britain. Due to the abolition of the British Navigation Acts, American merchants could now transport their goods in European and American ships rather than only British ships. British taxes on expensive wares such as tea, glass, lead and paper were forfeit, and other taxes became cheaper. Plus, American privateering raids on British merchant ships provided more wealth for the Continental Army.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the war went on however, America's economic prosperity began to fall. British warships began to prey on American shipping, and the increasing upkeep costs of the Continental Army meant that wealth from merchant ships decreased. As cashflow declined, the United States of America had to rely on European loans to maintain the war effort; France, Spain and the Netherlands lent the United States over $10 million during the war, causing major debt problems for the fledgling nation. Coin circulation had also begun to wane. Because of this, the United States began to print paper money and bills of credit to raise income. This proved unsuccessful, inflation skyrocketed, and the new paper money's value diminished. A popular saying circulated the colonies because of this: anything of little value became \\"not worth a continental.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 2010 Congressional Research Service report on the \\"Costs of Major U.S. Wars\\", the Revolution cost the United States the 2011 equivalent of $2.4 billion.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1780, the United States Congress had issued over $400 million in paper money to troops. Eventually, Congress tried to stop the inflation by imposing economic reforms. These failed, and only further devalued the American currency.[26] There is, however, some disagreement over the amount of currency issued.[27] Between 1775 and 1783 the colonies experienced an average annual inflation rate of approximately 4.3%. The rate of inflation peaked at 29.78% in 1778.[28][29] Numerous food riots were recorded as discontent grew over rapidly rising prices.[30] The destruction of property and the continued issuing of Continentals by the Congress was another cause of currency devaluation. In addition, counterfeiting of American dollars was carried out by the British Government as an intentional means of sabotaging the war effort.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the war, Congress asked individual colonies to equip their own troops, and pay upkeep for their own soldiers in the Continental Army. When the war ended, the United States had spent $37 million at the national level and $114 million at the state level. The United States finally solved its debt problems in the 1790s when Alexander Hamilton founded the First Bank of the United States in order to pay off war debts and establish good national credit.[32]","input":"How much money did france spend on the american revolution?"},{"output":"the thirteen British colonies","context":"The flag of the United States of America, often referred to as the American flag, is the national flag of the United States. It consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom) alternating with white, with a blue rectangle in the canton (referred to specifically as the \\"union\\") bearing fifty small, white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows, where rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternate with rows of five stars. The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and became the first states in the U.S.[1] Nicknames for the flag include The Stars and Stripes,[2] Old Glory,[3] and The Star-Spangled Banner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current design of the U.S. flag is its 27th; the design of the flag has been modified officially 26 times since 1777. The 48-star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49-star version became official on July 4, 1959. The 50-star flag was ordered by the then president Eisenhower on August 21, 1959, and was adopted in July 1960. It is the longest-used version of the U.S. flag and has been in use for over 57 years.[4]\\r\\nThe Continental Colors\\r\\n(aka the \\"Grand Union Flag\\")\\r\\nFlag of the British East India Company, 1707ÿ1801\\r\\nAt the time of the Declaration of Independence in July 1776, the Continental Congress would not legally adopt flags with \\"stars, white in a blue field\\" for another year. The flag contemporaneously known as \\"the Continental Colors\\" has historically been referred to as the first national flag.[5]\\r\\nThe Continental Navy raised the Colors as the ensign of the fledgling nation in the American War for Independencelikely with the expedient of transforming their previous British red ensigns by adding white stripesand would use this flag until 1777, when it would form the basis for the subsequent de jure designs.[5][6]\\r\\nThe name \\"Grand Union\\" was first applied to the Continental Colors by George Preble in his 1872 history of the American flag.[6]\\r\\nThe flag closely resembles the British East India Company flag of the era, and Sir Charles Fawcett argued in 1937 that the company flag inspired the design.[7] Both flags could have been easily constructed by adding white stripes to a British Red Ensign, one of the three maritime flags used throughout the British Empire at the time. However, an East India Company flag could have from nine to 13 stripes, and was not allowed to be flown outside the Indian Ocean.[8]\\r\\nIn any case, both the stripes (barry) and the stars (mullets) have precedents in classical heraldry. Mullets were comparatively rare in early modern heraldry, but an example of mullets representing territorial divisions predating the U.S. flag are those in the coat of arms of Valais of 1618, where seven mullets stood for seven districts.\\r\\nOn June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Resolution which stated: \\"Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\\"[9] Flag Day is now observed on June 14 of each year. While scholars still argue about this, tradition holds that the new flag was first hoisted in June 1777 by the Continental Army at the Middlebrook encampment.[10]\\r\\nThe first official U.S. flag flown during battle was on August 3, 1777, at Fort Schuyler (Fort Stanwix) during the Siege of Fort Stanwix. Massachusetts reinforcements brought news of the adoption by Congress of the official flag to Fort Schuyler. Soldiers cut up their shirts to make the white stripes; scarlet material to form the red was secured from red flannel petticoats of officers' wives, while material for the blue union was secured from Capt. Abraham Swartwout's blue cloth coat. A voucher is extant that Capt. Swartwout of Dutchess County was paid by Congress for his coat for the flag.[11]\\r\\nThe 1777 resolution was most probably meant to define a naval ensign. In the late 18th century, the notion of a national flag did not yet exist, or was only nascent. The flag resolution appears between other resolutions from the Marine Committee. On May 10, 1779, Secretary of the Board of War Richard Peters expressed concern \\"it is not yet settled what is the Standard of the United States.\\"[12] However, the term, \\"Standard,\\" referred to a national standard for the Army of the United States. Each regiment was to carry the national standard in addition to its regimental standard. The national standard was not a reference to the national or naval flag.[13]\\r\\nThe Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement, number of points, nor orientation for the stars and the arrangement or whether the flag had to have seven red stripes and six white ones or vice versa.[14] The appearance was up to the maker of the flag. Some flag makers arranged the stars into one big star, in a circle or in rows and some replaced a state's star with its initial.[15] One arrangement features 13 five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, with the stars arranged pointing outwards from the circle (as opposed to up), the so-called Betsy Ross flag. This flag, however, is more likely a flag used for celebrations of anniversaries of the nation's birthday. Experts have dated the earliest known example of this flag to be 1792 in a painting by John Trumbull.[16]\\r\\nDespite the 1777 resolution, the early years of American independence featured many different flags. Most were individually crafted rather than mass-produced. While there are many examples of 13-star arrangements, some of those flags included blue stripes as well as red and white. Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, in a letter dated October 3, 1778, to Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, described the American flag as consisting of \\"13 stripes, alternately red, white, and blue, a small square in the upper angle, next the flag staff, is a blue field, with 13 white stars, denoting a new Constellation.\\"[17] John Paul Jones used a variety of 13-star flags on his U.S. Navy ships including the well-documented 1779 flags of the Serapis and the Alliance. The Serapis flag had three rows of eight-pointed stars with stripes that were red, white, and blue. The flag for the Alliance, however, had five rows of eight-pointed stars with 13 red and white stripes, and the white stripes were on the outer edges.[18] Both flags were documented by the Dutch government in October 1779, making them two of the earliest known flags of 13 stars.[19]\\r\\nFrancis Hopkinson of New Jersey, a naval flag designer, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, designed the 1777 flag[20] while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board's Middle Department, sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777. The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee.[21] Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag, but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy. Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work. These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting's biography of Hopkinson. Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress, via the Continental Board of Admiralty, on May 25, 1780.[22] In this letter, he asked for a \\"Quarter Cask of the Public Wine\\" as payment for designing the U.S. flag, the seal for the Admiralty Board, the seal for the Treasury Board, Continental currency, the Great Seal of the United States, and other devices. However, in three subsequent bills to Congress, Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash, but he did not list his U.S. flag design. Instead, he asked to be paid for designing the \\"great Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the first bill; the \\"Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the second bill; and \\"the Naval Flag of the States\\" in the third, along with the other items. The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed, that is, a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones. The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea. By contrast, Hopkinson's flag for the United States had seven white stripes, and six red ones ÿ in reality, six red stripes laid on a white background.[23] Hopkinson's sketches have not been found, but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty (naval) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time. His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes;[24] whereas, his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones.[25] Hopkinson's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag. Remnants of Hopkinson's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President's seal.[23] When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board, his position was like that of today's Secretary of the Navy.[26] The payment was not made, however, because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress.[27][28] This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag, which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776.[29][30] Furthermore, a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10, 1779, documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army's use in battle.[31]\\r\\nThe origin of the stars and stripes design has been muddled by a story disseminated by the descendants of Betsy Ross. The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington. No evidence for this exists either in the diaries of George Washington nor in the records of the Continental Congress. Indeed, nearly a century passed before Ross' grandson, William Canby, first publicly suggested the story in 1870.[32] By her family's own admission, Ross ran an upholstery business, and she had never made a flag as of the supposed visit in June 1776.[33] Furthermore, her grandson admitted that his own search through the Journals of Congress and other official records failed to find corroboration of his grandmother's story.[34]\\r\\nThe family of Rebecca Young claimed that she sewed the first flag.[35] Young's daughter was Mary Pickersgill, who made the Star Spangled Banner Flag.[36][37] According to rumor, the Washington family coat of arms, shown in a 15th-century window of Selby Abbey, was the origin of the stars and stripes.[38]\\r\\nIn 1795, the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15 (to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the Union). For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were admitted, probably because it was thought that this would cause too much clutter. It was the 15-star, 15-stripe flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\", later known as \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", which is now the American national anthem. The flag is currently on display in the exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem\\" at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History in a two-story display chamber that protects the flag while it is on view.[39]\\r\\nOn April 4, 1818, a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid[40] in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies. The act specified that new flag designs should become official on the first July 4 (Independence Day) following admission of one or more new states. The most recent change, from 49 stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after Hawaii gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of Alaska in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.[41]\\r\\nPrior to the adoption of the 48-star flag in 1912, there was no official arrangement of the stars in the canton, although the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy used standardized designs. Throughout the 19th century there was an abundance of different star patterns, rectangular and circular.\\r\\nOn July 4, 2007, the 50-star flag became the version of the flag in longest use, surpassing the 48-star flag that was used from 1912 to 1959.\\r\\nThe U.S. flag was brought to the city of Canton (GuҊngzhu) in China in 1784 by the merchant ship Empress of China, which carried a cargo of ginseng.[42] There it gained the designation \\"Flower Flag\\" (Chinese: ; pinyin: huq; Cantonese Yale: fke).[43] According to a pseudonymous account first published in the Boston Courier and later retold by author and U.S. naval officer George H. Preble:\\r\\nWhen the thirteen stripes and stars first appeared at Canton, much curiosity was excited among the people. News was circulated that a strange ship had arrived from the further end of the world, bearing a flag \\"as beautiful as a flower.\\" Every body went to see the kwa kee chuen [; Fkesyhn], or \\"flower flagship.\\" This name at once established itself in the language, and America is now called the kwa kee kwoh [??; Fkegwok], the \\"flower flag country\\"and an American, kwa kee kwoh yin [??; Fkegwokyhn]\\"flower flag countryman\\"a more complimentary designation than that of \\"red headed barbarian\\"the name first bestowed upon the Dutch.[44][45]\\r\\nIn the above quote, the Chinese words are written phonetically based on spoken Cantonese. The names given were common usage in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[46] Other Asian nations have equivalent terms for America, for example Vietnamese: Hoa K? (\\"Flower Flag\\"). Chinese now refer to the United States as simplified Chinese: ˇ; traditional Chinese: ˇ??; pinyin: Migu܇. Mi is short for Miljin (simplified Chinese: ˇͫ; traditional Chinese: ˇͫ??, phono-semantic matching of \\"American\\") and \\"gu܇\\" means \\"country\\", so this name is unrelated to the flag. However, the \\"flower flag\\" terminology persists in some places today: for example, American Ginseng is called simplified Chinese: y; traditional Chinese: ??; literally: \\"flower flag ginseng\\" in Chinese, and Citibank, which opened a branch in China in 1902, is known as 跐k; \\"Flower Flag Bank\\".[46]\\r\\nThe U.S. flag took its first trip around the world in 1787ÿ90 on board the Columbia.[43] William Driver, who coined the phrase \\"Old Glory\\", took the U.S. flag around the world in 1831ÿ32.[43] The flag attracted the notice of Japanese when an oversized version was carried to Yokohama by the steamer Great Republic as part of a round-the-world journey in 1871.[47]\\r\\nIn the following table depicting the 28 various designs of the United States flag, the star patterns for the flags are merely the usual patterns, often associated with the United States Navy. Canton designs, prior to the proclamation of the 48-star flag, had no official arrangement of the stars. Furthermore, the exact colors of the flag were not standardized until 1934.[48]\\r\\nIn the November 2012 U.S. election, Puerto Rico voted to become a U.S. state. However, the legitimacy of the result of this election was disputed.[50] On June 11, 2017, another referendum was held, this time with the result that 97% of voters in Puerto Rico voted for statehood.[51][52] Similarly in November 2016, a statehood referendum was held in the District of Columbia where 86% of voters approved the proposal. If a new U.S. state were to be admitted, it would require a new design on the flag to accommodate the additional star.[53]\\r\\nThe modern meaning of the flag was forged in December 1860, when Major Robert Anderson moved the U.S. garrison from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. Author Adam Goodheart argues this was the opening move of the American Civil War, and the flag was used throughout northern states to symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism.\\r\\nBefore that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory, flown from forts, embassies, and ships, and displayed on special occasions like American Independence day. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flewas it does today, and especially as it did after the September 11 attacks in 2001from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. For the first time American flags were mass-produced rather than individually stitched and even so, manufacturers could not keep up with demand. As the long winter of 1861 turned into spring, that old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.\\r\\nÿ Adam Goodheart.[54]\\r\\nThe flag of the United States is one of the nation's most widely recognized symbols. Within the United States, flags are frequently displayed not only on public buildings but on private residences. The flag is a common motif on decals for car windows, and clothing ornaments such as badges and lapel pins. Throughout the world the flag has been used in public discourse to refer to the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe flag has become a powerful symbol of Americanism, and is proudly flown on many occasions, with giant outdoor flags used by retail outlets to draw customers. Desecration of the flag is considered a public outrage, but remains protected as freedom of speech. Scholars have noted the irony that \\"[t]he flag is so revered because it represents the land of the free, and that freedom includes the ability to use or abuse that flag in protest\\".[55] In worldwide comparison, Testi noted in 2010 that the United States was not unique in adoring its banner, for the flags of Scandinavian countries are also \\"beloved, domesticated, commercialized and sacralized objects\\".[56]\\r\\nThe man credited with designing the current 50 star American flag was Robert G. Heft. He was 17 years old at the time and created the flag design in 1958 as a high school class project while living with his grandparents in Ohio.[57] He received a B? on the project.[58] According to Heft, his history teacher honored their agreement to change his grade to an A after his design was selected.[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic design of the current flag is specified by 4 U.S.C.??1; 4 U.S.C.??2 outlines the addition of new stars to represent new states. The specification gives the following values:\\r\\nThese specifications are contained in an executive order which, strictly speaking, governs only flags made for or by the U.S. federal government.[62] In practice, most U.S. national flags available for sale to the public have a different width-to-height ratio; common sizes are 2 G 3?ft. or 4 G 6?ft. (flag ratio 1.5), 2.5 G 4?ft. or 5 G 8?ft. (1.6), or 3 G 5?ft. or 6 G 10?ft. (1.667). Even flags flown over the U.S. Capitol for sale to the public through Representatives or Senators are provided in these sizes.[63] Flags that are made to the prescribed 1.9 ratio are often referred to as \\"G-spec\\" (for \\"government specification\\") flags.\\r\\nThe exact red, white, and blue colors to be used in the flag are specified with reference to the CAUS Standard Color Reference of America, 10th edition. Specifically, the colors are \\"White\\", \\"Old Glory Red\\", and \\"Old Glory Blue\\".[64] The CIE coordinates for the colors of the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card were formally specified in JOSA in 1946.[65] These colors form the standard for cloth, and there is no perfect way to convert them to RGB for display on screen or CMYK for printing. The \\"relative\\" coordinates in the following table were found by scaling the luminous reflectance relative to the flag's \\"white\\".\\r\\nAs with the design, the official colors are only officially required for flags produced for the U.S. federal government, and other colors are often used for mass-market flags, printed reproductions, and other products intended to evoke flag colors. The practice of using more saturated colors than the official cloth is not new. As Taylor, Knoche, and Granville wrote in 1950: \\"The color of the official wool bunting [of the blue field] is a very dark blue, but printed reproductions of the flag, as well as merchandise supposed to match the flag, present the color as a deep blue much brighter than the official wool.\\"[67]\\r\\nSometimes, Pantone Matching System (PMS) approximations to the flag colors are used. One set was given on the website of the U.S. embassy in London as early as 1998; the website of the U.S. embassy in Stockholm claimed in 2001 that those had been suggested by Pantone, and that the U.S. Government Printing Office preferred a different set. A third red was suggested by a California Military Department document in 2002.[68] In 2001, the Texas legislature specified that the colors of the Texas flag should be \\"(1) the same colors used in the United States flag; and (2) defined as numbers 193 (red) and 281 (dark blue) of the Pantone Matching System.\\"[69]\\r\\nWhen Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood in the 1950s, more than 1,500 designs were submitted to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.[71] At the time, credit was given by the executive department to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry for the design.\\r\\nOf these proposals, one created by 17-year-old Robert G. Heft in 1958 as a school project received the most publicity. His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a Bÿ for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959.[72] According to Heft, his teacher did keep to their agreement and changed his grade to an A for the project.[60] The 49- and 50-star flags were each flown for the first time at Fort McHenry on Independence Day, in 1959 and 1960 respectively.[60]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag may be decorated with golden fringe surrounding the perimeter of the flag as long as it does not deface the flag proper. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the appearance of the flag.\\r\\nThe first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the Army used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the attorney general addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars) \\"...?is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy?...\\" as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of Title 4 of the United States Code law books and is a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian. However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered, there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.[73] Several federal courts have upheld this conclusion,[74][75] most recently and forcefully in Colorado v. Drew, a Colorado Court of Appeals judgment that was released in May 2010.[76] Traditionally, the Army and Air Force use a fringed National Color for parade, color guard and indoor display, while the Sea Services (Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) use a fringeless National Color for all occasions.\\r\\nThe flag is customarily flown year-round at most public buildings, and it is not unusual to find private houses flying full-size (3 by 5 feet (0.91 by 1.52?m)) flags. Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Presidents' Day, Flag Day, and on Independence Day. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans. Also on Memorial Day it is common to fly the flag at half staff, until noon, in remembrance of those who lost their lives fighting in U.S. wars.\\r\\nThe United States Flag Code outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag. For example, the flag should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the ensign responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This tradition may come from the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, where countries were asked to dip their flag to King Edward VII: the American flag bearer did not. Team captain Martin Sheridan is famously quoted as saying \\"this flag dips to no earthly king\\", though the true provenance of this quotation is unclear.[77][78]\\r\\nThe flag should never be allowed to touch the ground and, if flown at night, must be illuminated. If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement ceremonies, often on Flag Day, June 14. (The Boy Scouts of America recommends that modern nylon or polyester flags be recycled instead of burned, due to hazardous gases being produced when such materials are burned.)[79]\\r\\nThe Flag Code prohibits using the flag \\"for any advertising purpose\\" and also states that the flag \\"should not be embroidered, printed, or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use\\".[80] Both of these codes are generally ignored, almost always without comment.\\r\\nSection 8, entitled Respect For Flag states in part: \\"The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\\", and \\"No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform\\". Section 3 of the Flag Code[81] defines \\"the flag\\" as anything \\"by which the average person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the United States of America\\".\\r\\nAn additional part of Section 8 Respect For Flag, that is frequently violated at sporting events is part (c) \\"The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.\\"\\r\\nAlthough the Flag Code is U.S. federal law, there is no penalty for a private citizen or group failing to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforcedindeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.[82] Passage of the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment would overrule legal precedent that has been established.\\r\\nWhen the flag is affixed to the right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any physical object that moves), it should be oriented so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag decals on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.\\r\\nThe flag has been displayed on every U.S. spacecraft designed for manned flight, including Mercury, Gemini, Apollo Command/Service Module, Apollo Lunar Module, and the Space Shuttle. The flag also appeared on the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle used for Apollo. But since Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were launched and landed vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight as the Space Shuttle did on its landing approach, the \\"streaming\\" convention was not followed and these flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally, perpendicular to the direction of flight.\\r\\nOn some U.S. military uniforms, flag patches are worn on the right shoulder, following the vehicle convention with the union toward the front. This rule dates back to the Army's early history, when both mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer, who carried the Colors into battle. As he charged, his forward motion caused the flag to stream back. Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right, while the stripes flew to the left.[83] Several US military uniforms, such as flight suits worn by members of the United States Air Force and Navy, have the flag patch on the left shoulder.[84][85]\\r\\nOther organizations that wear flag patches on their uniforms can have the flag facing in either direction. The congressional charter of the Boy Scouts of America stipulates that the uniforms should not imitate U.S. military uniforms; consequently, the flags are displayed on the right shoulder with the stripes facing front, the reverse of the military style.[86] Law enforcement officers often wear a small flag patch, either on a shoulder, or above a shirt pocket.\\r\\nEvery U.S. astronaut since the crew of Gemini 4 has worn the flag on the left shoulder of his or her space suit, with the exception of the crew of Apollo 1, whose flags were worn on the right shoulder. In this case, the canton was on the left.\\r\\nThe flag did not appear on U.S. postal stamp issues until the Battle of White Plains Issue was released in 1926, depicting the flag with a circle of 13 stars. The 48-star flag first appeared on the General Casimir Pulaski issue of 1931, though in a small monochrome depiction. The first U.S. postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject was issued July 4, 1957, Scott catalog number 1094.[87] Since that time the flag has frequently appeared on U.S. stamps.\\r\\nIn 1907 Eben Appleton, New York stockbroker and grandson of Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead (the commander of Fort McHenry during the 1814 bombardment) loaned the Star Spangled Banner Flag to the Smithsonian Institution, and in 1912 he converted the loan to a gift. Appleton donated the flag with the wish that it would always be on view to the public. In 1994, the National Museum of American History determined that the Star Spangled Banner Flag required further conservation treatment to remain on public display. In 1998 teams of museum conservators, curators, and other specialists helped move the flag from its home in the Museum's Flag Hall into a new conservation laboratory. Following the reopening of the National Museum of American History on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a special exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem,\\" where it rests at a 10 degree angle in dim light for conservation purposes.[39]\\r\\nBy presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, U.S. flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.\\r\\nThe flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following days:[103]\\r\\nThe flag is displayed at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) as a sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; statewide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.\\r\\nTo properly fly the flag at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist it top of the staff, then lower it to the half-staff position, halfway between the top and bottom of the staff. Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half-staff, it should be first briefly hoisted to the top of the staff.[107]\\r\\nFederal statutes provide that the flag should be flown at half-staff on the following dates:\\r\\nNational Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, on July 27, was formerly a day of half-staff observance until the law expired in 2003. In 2009, it became a day of full-staff observance.[104][113][114]\\r\\nThough not part of the official Flag Code, according to military custom, flags should be folded into a triangular shape when not in use. To properly fold the flag:\\r\\nThere is also no specific meaning for each fold of the flag. However, there are scripts read by non-government organizations and also by the Air Force that are used during the flag folding ceremony. These scripts range from historical timelines of the flag to religious themes.[115][116]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag of the United States plays a role in military funerals,[117] and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents). A burial flag is draped over the deceased's casket as a pall during services. Just prior to the casket being lowered into the ground, the flag is ceremonially folded and presented to the deceased's next of kin as a token of respect.[118]\\r\\nFlag of Bikini Atoll\\r\\nFlag of Liberia\\r\\nFlag of Malaysia\\r\\nFlag of El Salvador 1875ÿ1912\\r\\nFlag of Brittany","input":"What does the red stripe american flag mean?"},{"output":"285 mL","context":"A schooner is a type of glass for serving drinks.

In other Australian states \\"schooner\\" traditionally refers to a glass of 425 mL (15 imp. fl. oz., or three-quarters of an imperial pint, pre-metrication). It is the most common size in New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory, although not unknown in other states. Some hospitality venues in Western Australia are going through a process of \\"schoonerification\\", whereby the previous culture of drinking by pints has been changed with vessels of schooner size to allay increasing costs to venues and with encouragement from the state government to curb binge drinking.\\r\\nThere is no legal definition of a schooner in Australia[1], the volume of beer served depends on the venue.

It shouldn't be confused with Schooner Lager, which is a regional brand of beer found only in the eastern maritime provinces of Canada.\\r\\nIn Britain, a schooner is a large sherry glass. Sherry is traditionally served in one of two measures, based on how they were served in naval days. There was a clipper, the smaller measure, or a schooner, the larger measure, named after the sort of ships that brought sherry over from Spain. The schooner name was more particular to Bristol, to where most sherry was imported, stored and bottled. It is usually served on its own.

It is situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, and is a land bridge between Asia and Africa. Sinai has a land area of about 60,000?km2 (23,000?sq?mi) and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. Administratively, the Sinai Peninsula is divided into two governorates: the South Sinai Governorate and the North Sinai Governorate. Three other governorates span the Suez Canal, crossing into African Egypt: Suez Governorate on the southern end of the Suez Canal, Ismailia Governorate in the center, and Port Said Governorate in the north.\\r\\nThe Sinai Peninsula has been a part of Egypt from the First Dynasty of ancient Egypt (c.?3100 BC). This comes in stark contrast to the region north of it, the Levant (present-day territories of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and Palestine), which, due largely to its strategic geopolitical location and cultural convergences, has historically been the center of conflict between Egypt and various states of Mesopotamia and Asia Minor. In periods of foreign occupation, the Sinai was, like the rest of Egypt, also occupied and controlled by foreign empires, in more recent history the Ottoman Empire (1517ÿ1867) and the United Kingdom (1882ÿ1956). Israel invaded and occupied Sinai during the Suez Crisis (known in Egypt as the Tripartite Aggression due to the simultaneous coordinated attack by the UK, France and Israel) of 1956, and during the Six-Day War of 1967. On 6 October 1973, Egypt launched the Yom Kippur War to retake the peninsula, which was the site of fierce fighting between Egyptian and Israeli forces. By 1982, as a result of the IsraelÿEgypt Peace Treaty of 1979, Israel had withdrawn from all of the Sinai Peninsula except the contentious territory of Taba, which was returned after a ruling by a commission of arbitration in 1989.\\r\\nToday, Sinai has become a tourist destination due to its natural setting, rich coral reefs, and biblical history. Mount Sinai is one of the most religiously significant places in the Abrahamic faiths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Sinai may have been derived from the ancient moon-god Sin[1] or from the Hebrew word Seneh (Hebrew: ???????? Senneh)[2] The peninsula acquired the name due to the assumption that a mountain near Saint Catherine's Monastery is the Biblical Mount Sinai. However this assumption is contested.[3]\\r\\nIts Arabic name is ??????? Sؐn??, while in Egyptian Arabic it is referred to as ???? Sؐna; IPA:?[?si?n?]. Other names in regional languages include Classical Syriac: ????? and Hebrew: ??????? Sinai.\\r\\nIn addition to its formal name, Egyptians also refer to it as Ar? ul-Fairz (??? ??????? 'the land of turquoise'). The ancient Egyptians called it Ta Mefkat, or 'land of turquoise'.[4]\\r\\nIn English, the name is now usually pronounced /?sa?na?/.[5][6] The traditional pronunciation is /?sa?ne?/ or /?sa?ne?a?/.[7][8]\\r\\nSinai is triangular in shape, with northern shore lying on the southern Mediterranean Sea, and southwest and southeast shores on Gulf of Suez and Gulf of Aqaba of the Red Sea. It is linked to the African continent by the Isthmus of Suez, 125 kilometres (78?mi) wide strip of land, containing the Suez Canal. The eastern isthmus, linking it to the Asian mainland, is around 200 kilometres (120?mi) wide. The peninsula's eastern shore separates the Arabian plate from the African plate.[9]\\r\\nThe southernmost tip is the Ras Muhammad National Park.\\r\\nMost of the Sinai Peninsula is divided among the two governorates of Egypt: South Sinai (Ganub Sina) and North Sinai (Shamal Sina).[10] Together, they comprise around 60,000 square kilometres (23,000 sq mi) and have a population (January 2013) of 597,000. Three more governates span the Suez Canal, crossing into African Egypt: Suez (el-Sewais) is on the southern end of the Suez Canal, Ismailia (el-Isma'ileyyah) in the centre, and Port Said in the north.\\r\\nThe largest city of Sinai is Arish, capital of the North Sinai, with around 160,000 residents. Other larger settlements include Sharm el-Sheikh and El-Tor, on the southern coast. Inland Sinai is arid, mountainous and sparsely populated, the largest settlements being Saint Catherine and Nekhel.[10]\\r\\nSinai is one of the coldest provinces in Egypt because of its high altitudes and mountainous topographies. Winter temperatures in some of Sinai's cities and towns reach ?16?C (3?F).[citation needed]\\r\\nSinai was called Mafkat or 'country of turquoise' by the ancient Egyptians[12][13] From the time of the First Dynasty or before, the Egyptians mined turquoise in Sinai at two locations, now called by their Egyptian Arabic names Wadi Magharah and Serabit El Khadim. The mines were worked intermittently and on a seasonal basis for thousands of years. Modern attempts to exploit the deposits have been unprofitable. These may be the first historically attested mines.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the end of the time of Darius I, the Great (521ÿ486 BCE) Sinai was part of the Persian province of Abar-Nahra, which means 'beyond the river [Euphrates]'.[14]\\r\\nCambyses successfully managed the crossing of the hostile Sinai Desert, traditionally Egypt's first and strongest line of defence, and brought the Egyptians under Psamtik III, son and successor of Ahmose, to battle at Pelusium. The Egyptians lost and retired to Memphis; the city fell to the Persian control and the Pharaoh was carried off in captivity to Susa in mainland Persia.\\r\\nAfter the death of the last Nabatean king, Rabbel II Soter, in 106,[15] the Roman emperor Trajan faced practically no resistance and conquered the kingdom on 22 March 106. With this conquest, the Roman Empire went on to control all shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The Sinai Peninsula became part of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea.[16]\\r\\nSaint Catherine's Monastery on the foot of Mount Sinai was constructed by order of the Emperor Justinian between 527 and 565. Most of the Sinai Peninsula became part of the province of Palaestina Salutaris in the 6th century.\\r\\nDuring the Crusades it was under control of Fatimid Caliphate. Later, Saladin abolished the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt and took this region under his control too. It was the military route from Cairo to Damascus during the Crusades.And in order to secure this route he built a citadel on the island of Pharaoh in Taba known by his name 'Saladin's citadel'.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe peninsula was governed as part of Egypt under the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt from 1260 until 1517, when the Ottoman Sultan, Selim the Grim, defeated the Egyptians at the Battles of Marj Dabiq and al-Raydaniyya, and incorporated Egypt into the Ottoman Empire. From then until 1906, Sinai was administered by the Ottoman provincial government of the Pashalik of Egypt, even following the establishment of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule over the rest of Egypt in 1805.\\r\\nIn 1906, the Ottoman Porte formally transferred administration of Sinai to the Egyptian government, which essentially meant that it fell under the control of the United Kingdom, who had occupied and largely controlled Egypt since 1882. The border imposed by the British runs in an almost straight line from Rafah on the Mediterranean shore to Taba on the Gulf of Aqaba. This line has served as the eastern border of Egypt ever since.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the 1948 ArabÿIsraeli War, Egyptian forces entered the former British Mandate of Palestine from Sinai to support Palestinian and other Arab forces against the newly declared State of Israel. For a period during the war, Israeli forces entered the north-eastern corner of Sinai.[17] With the exception of Palestine's Gaza Strip, which came under the administration of the All-Palestine Government,[18] the western frontier of the former Mandate of Palestine became the EgyptianÿIsraeli frontier under the 1949 Armistice Agreement. In 1958, the Gaza Strip came under direct Egyptian military administration, though it was governed separately from Sinai, and was never annexed by Egypt. The Egyptian government maintained that Egyptian administration would be terminated upon the end of the conflict with Israel.\\r\\nIn 1956, Egypt nationalised the Suez Canal,[19] a waterway marking the boundary between Egyptian territory in Africa and the Sinai Peninsula. Thereafter, Israeli ships were prohibited from using the Canal,[20] owing to the state of war between the two states. Egypt also prohibited ships from using Egyptian territorial waters on the eastern side of the peninsula to travel to and from Israel, effectively imposing a blockade on the Israeli port of Eilat. Subsequently, in what is known in Egypt as the Tripartite Aggression, Israeli forces, aided by Britain, and France (which sought to reverse the nationalisation and regain control over the Suez Canal), invaded Sinai and occupied much of the peninsula within a few days. Several months later Israel withdrew its forces from Sinai, following strong pressure from the United States and the Soviet Union. Thereafter, the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) was stationed in Sinai to prevent any further conflict in the Sinai.\\r\\nIn 1967, Egypt reinforced its military presence in Sinai and on 16 May ordered the UNEF out of Sinai with immediate effect.[21] Secretary-General U Thant eventually complied and ordered the withdrawal without Security Council authorisation. In the course of the Six-Day War that broke out shortly thereafter, Israel captured the entire Sinai Peninsula, and Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan (which it had ruled since 1949), and the Golan Heights from Syria. The Suez Canal, the east bank of which was now occupied by Israel, was closed. Israel commenced efforts at large scale Israeli settlement in the peninsula.\\r\\nFollowing the Israeli conquest of Sinai, Egypt launched the War of Attrition (1967ÿ70) aimed at forcing Israel to withdraw from Egyptian territory. The war saw protracted conflict in the Suez Canal Zone, ranging from limited to large scale combat. Israeli shelling of the cities of Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez on the west bank of the canal, led to high civilian casualties (including the virtual destruction of Suez), and contributed to the flight of 700,000[22] Egyptian internal refugees. Ultimately, the war concluded in 1970 with no change in the front line.[23]\\r\\nOn 6 October 1973, Egypt commenced Operation Badr to retake the Sinai, while Syria launched a simultaneous operation to retake the Golan Heights,[citation needed] thereby beginning the Yom Kippur War (known in Egypt and much of Europe as the October War). Egyptian engineering forces built pontoon bridges to cross the Suez Canal, and stormed the Bar-Lev Line, Israel's defensive line along the canal. Though the Egyptians maintained control of most of the east bank of the Canal, in the later stages of the war, the Israeli military crossed the southern section of Canal, cutting off the Egyptian 3rd Army, and occupied a section of the west bank. The war ended following a mutually agreed-upon ceasefire. After the war, as part of the subsequent Sinai Disengagement Agreements, Israel withdrew from the Canal, with Egypt agreeing to permit passage of Israeli ships. The canal was reopened in 1975, with President Sadat leading the first convoy through the canal aboard an Egyptian destroyer.\\r\\nIn 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in which Israel agreed to withdraw from the entirety of Sinai. Israel subsequently withdrew in several stages, ending in 1982. The Israeli pull-out involved dismantling almost all Israeli settlements, including the settlement of Yamit in north-eastern Sinai. The exception was the coastal city of Sharm el-Sheikh, which the Israelis had founded as Ofira during the period of their occupation. The Treaty allows monitoring of Sinai by the Multinational Force and Observers, and limits the number of Egyptian military forces in the peninsula.\\r\\nSince the early 2000s, Sinai has been the site of several terror attacks against tourists, the majority of whom are Egyptian. Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area. Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation.[24] (See 2004 Sinai bombings, 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings). Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the 2012 Egyptian-Israeli border attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants. (See Sinai insurgency).\\r\\nAlso on the rise are kidnappings of refugees. According to Meron Estifanos, Eritrean refugees are often kidnapped by Bedouin in the northern Sinai, tortured, raped, and only released after receiving a large ransom.[25][26]\\r\\nUnder President el-Sisi, Egypt has implemented a rigorous policy of controlling the border to the Gaza Strip, including the dismantling of tunnels between Gaza and Sinai.[27]\\r\\nThe two governorates of North and South Sinai have a total population of 597,000 (January 2013). This figure rises to 1,400,000 by including Western Sinai, the parts of the Port Said, Ismailia and Suez Governorates lying east of the Suez Canal. Port Said alone has a population of roughly 500,000 people (January 2013). Portions of the populations of Ismailia and Suez live in west Sinai, while the rest live on the western side of the Suez Canal.\\r\\nPopulation of Sinai has largely consisted of desert-dwelling Bedouins with their colourful traditional costumes and significant culture.[28] Large numbers of Egyptians from the Nile Valley and Delta moved to the area to work in tourism, but development adversely affected the native Bedouin population.[citation needed] In order to help alleviate their problems, various NGOs began to operate in the region, including the Makhad Trust, a UK charity that assists the Bedouin in developing a sustainable income while protecting Sinai's natural environment, heritage and culture.[citation needed]\\r\\nSince the IsraeliÿEgyptian peace treaty, Sinai's scenic spots (including coral reefs offshore) and religious structures have become important to the tourism industry. The most popular tourist destination in Sinai are Mount Sinai (Jabal Musa) and St Catherine's Monastery, which is considered to be the oldest working Christian monastery in the world, and the beach resorts of Sharm el-Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba and Taba. Most tourists arrive at Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport, through Eilat, Israel and the Taba Border Crossing, by road from Cairo or by ferry from Aqaba in Jordan.[citation needed]\\r\\nCoordinates: 2930N 3350E? / ?29.500N 33.833E? / 29.500; 33.833","input":"To which nation does the sinai peninsula belong?"},{"output":"The Tokyo Kitasuna Little League","context":"The 2015 Little League World Series was held in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, from August 21 until August 30, 2015.[1] Eight teams from the United States and eight from throughout the world competed in the 69th edition of the tournament.

The magnetic field at any given point is specified by both a direction and a magnitude (or strength); as such it is represented by a vector field.[nb 1] The term is used for two distinct but closely related fields denoted by the symbols B and H, where H is measured in units of amperes per meter (symbol: A?m?1 or A/m) in the SI. B is measured in teslas (symbol: T) and newtons per meter per ampere (symbol: N?m?1?A?1 or N/(m?A)) in the SI. B is most commonly defined in terms of the Lorentz force it exerts on moving electric charges.\\r\\nMagnetic fields can be produced by moving electric charges and the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a fundamental quantum property, their spin.[1][2] In special relativity, electric and magnetic fields are two interrelated aspects of a single object, called the electromagnetic tensor; the split of this tensor into electric and magnetic fields depends on the relative velocity of the observer and charge. In quantum physics, the electromagnetic field is quantized and electromagnetic interactions result from the exchange of photons.\\r\\nIn everyday life, magnetic fields are most often encountered as a force created by permanent magnets, which pull on ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt, or nickel, and attract or repel other magnets.\\r\\nMagnetic fields are widely used throughout modern technology, particularly in electrical engineering and electromechanics. The Earth produces its own magnetic field, which is important in navigation, and it shields the Earth's atmosphere from solar wind. Rotating magnetic fields are used in both electric motors and generators. Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the Hall effect. The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is studied in the discipline of magnetic circuits.\\r\\nAlthough magnets and magnetism were known much earlier, the study of magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles.[nb 2] Noting that the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points 'poles' in analogy to Earth's poles. He also clearly articulated the principle that magnets always have both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.\\r\\nAlmost three centuries later, William Gilbert of Colchester replicated Petrus Peregrinus' work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is a magnet.[3] Published in 1600, Gilbert's work, De Magnete, helped to establish magnetism as a science.\\r\\nIn 1750, John Michell stated that magnetic poles attract and repel in accordance with an inverse square law.[4] Charles-Augustin de Coulomb experimentally verified this in 1785 and stated explicitly that the north and south poles cannot be separated.[5] Building on this force between poles, Simon Denis Poisson (1781ÿ1840) created the first successful model of the magnetic field, which he presented in 1824.[6] In this model, a magnetic H-field is produced by 'magnetic poles' and magnetism is due to small pairs of north/south magnetic poles.\\r\\nThree discoveries challenged this foundation of magnetism, though. First, in 1819, Hans Christian ?rsted discovered that an electric current generates a magnetic field encircling it. Then in 1820, Andr-Marie Ampre showed that parallel wires having currents in the same direction attract one another. Finally, Jean-Baptiste Biot and Flix Savart discovered the BiotÿSavart law in 1820, which correctly predicts the magnetic field around any current-carrying wire.\\r\\nExtending these experiments, Ampre published his own successful model of magnetism in 1825. In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets[7] and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model.[nb 3] This has the additional benefit of explaining why magnetic charge can not be isolated. Further, Ampre derived both Ampre's force law describing the force between two currents and Ampre's law, which, like the BiotÿSavart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Ampre introduced the term electrodynamics to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.\\r\\nIn 1831, Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field. He described this phenomenon in what is known as Faraday's law of induction. Later, Franz Ernst Neumann proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Ampre's force law.[8] In the process, he introduced the magnetic vector potential, which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.\\r\\nIn 1850, Lord Kelvin, then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted H and B. The former applied to Poisson's model and the latter to Ampre's model and induction.[9] Further, he derived how H and B relate to each other.\\r\\nThe reason H and B are used for the two magnetic fields has been a source of some debate among science historians. Most agree that Kelvin avoided M to prevent confusion with the SI fundamental unit of length, the Metre, abbreviated \\"m\\". Others believe the choices were purely random.[10][11]\\r\\nBetween 1861 and 1865, James Clerk Maxwell developed and published Maxwell's equations, which explained and united all of classical electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled On Physical Lines of Force in 1861. These equations were valid although incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field and demonstrated the fact that light is an electromagnetic wave. Heinrich Hertz experimentally confirmed this fact in 1887.\\r\\nThe twentieth century extended electrodynamics to include relativity and quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein, in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. (See moving magnet and conductor problem for details about the thought experiment that eventually helped Albert Einstein to develop special relativity.) Finally, the emergent field of quantum mechanics was merged with electrodynamics to form quantum electrodynamics (QED).\\r\\nThe magnetic field can be defined in several equivalent ways based on the effects it has on its environment.\\r\\nOften the magnetic field is defined by the force it exerts on a moving charged particle. It is known from experiments in electrostatics that a particle of charge q in an electric field E experiences a force F = qE. However, in other situations, such as when a charged particle moves in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire, the force also depends on the velocity of that particle. Fortunately, the velocity dependent portion can be separated out such that the force on the particle satisfies the Lorentz force law,\\r\\nHere v is the particle's velocity and G denotes the cross product. The vector B is termed the magnetic field, and it is defined as the vector field necessary to make the Lorentz force law correctly describe the motion of a charged particle. This definition allows the determination of B in the following way[14]\\r\\n[T]he command, \\"Measure the direction and magnitude of the vector B at such and such a place,\\" calls for the following operations: Take a particle of known charge q. Measure the force on q at rest, to determine E. Then measure the force on the particle when its velocity is v; repeat with v in some other direction. Now find a B that makes the Lorentz force law fit all these resultsthat is the magnetic field at the place in question.\\r\\nAlternatively, the magnetic field can be defined in terms of the torque it produces on a magnetic dipole (see magnetic torque on permanent magnets below).\\r\\nIn addition to B, there is a quantity H, which is also sometimes called the magnetic field.[nb 4] In a vacuum, B and H are proportional to each other, with the multiplicative constant depending on the physical units. Inside a material they are different (see H and B inside and outside of magnetic materials). The term \\"magnetic field\\" is historically reserved for H while using other terms for B. Informally, though, and formally for some recent textbooks mostly in physics, the term 'magnetic field' is used to describe B as well as or in place of H.[nb 5] There are many alternative names for both (see sidebar).\\r\\nIn SI units, B is measured in teslas (symbol: T) and correspondingly B (magnetic flux) is measured in webers (symbol: Wb) so that a flux density of 1?Wb/m2 is 1?tesla. The SI unit of tesla is equivalent to (newton{second)/(coulomb{metre).[nb 6] In Gaussian-cgs units, B is measured in gauss (symbol: G). (The conversion is 1 T = 10,000 G.) One nanotesla is also called a gamma (symbol: ).[15] The H-field is measured in amperes per metre (A/m) in SI units, and in oersteds (Oe) in cgs units.[16]\\r\\nThe precision attained for a magnetic field measurement for Gravity Probe B experiment is 5?attoteslas (6982500000000000000?5G10?18?T);[17] the largest magnetic field produced in a laboratory is 2.8?kT (VNIIEF in Sarov, Russia, 1998).[18] The magnetic field of some astronomical objects such as magnetars are much higher; magnetars range from 0.1 to 100?GT (108 to 1011?T).[19] See orders of magnitude (magnetic field).\\r\\nDevices used to measure the local magnetic field are called magnetometers. Important classes of magnetometers include using induction magnetometer (or search-coil magnetometer) which measure only varying magnetic field, rotating coil magnetometer, Hall effect magnetometers, NMR magnetometers, SQUID magnetometers, and fluxgate magnetometers. The magnetic fields of distant astronomical objects are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce synchrotron radiation that is detectable in radio waves.\\r\\nMapping the magnetic field of an object is simple in principle. First, measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of locations (or at every point in space). Then, mark each location with an arrow (called a vector) pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.\\r\\nAn alternative method to map the magnetic field is to 'connect' the arrows to form magnetic field lines. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength.\\r\\nMagnetic field lines are like streamlines in fluid flow, in that they represent something continuous, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines. An advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the 'number' of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly 'translated' to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the surface integral of the magnetic field.\\r\\nVarious phenomena have the effect of \\"displaying\\" magnetic field lines as though the field lines were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field, form lines that correspond to 'field lines'.[nb 7] Magnetic field \\"lines\\" are also visually displayed in polar auroras, in which plasma particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.\\r\\nField lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In ferromagnetic substances like iron and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a tension, (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines. 'Unlike' poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; 'like' poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other. The rigorous form of this concept is the electromagnetic stressÿenergy tensor.\\r\\nPermanent magnets are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron and nickel, that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole.\\r\\nThe magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small[nb 8] straight magnet is proportional to the magnet's strength (called its magnetic dipole moment m). The equations are non-trivial and also depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, m points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its m by 180 degrees.\\r\\nThe magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modelling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called dipoles each having their own m. The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles. And, any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles.\\r\\nThere are two competing models for the nature of these dipoles. These two models produce two different magnetic fields, H and B. Outside a material, though, the two are identical (to a multiplicative constant) so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials.\\r\\nIt is sometimes useful to model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the Coulomb force between electric charges. This is called the Gilbert model of magnetism, after William Gilbert. In this model, a magnetic H-field is produced by magnetic charges that are 'smeared' around each pole. These magnetic charges are in fact related to the magnetization field M.\\r\\nThe H-field, therefore, is analogous to the electric field E, which starts at a positive electric charge and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all H-field lines point away from the north pole (whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole (whether inside the magnet or out) all H-field lines point toward the south pole. A north pole, then, feels a force in the direction of the H-field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the H-field.\\r\\nIn the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole m is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength qm separated by a small distance vector d, such that m = qm?d. The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field H both inside and outside magnetic materials, in particular the fact that H is opposite to the magnetization field M inside a permanent magnet.\\r\\nSince it is based on the fictitious idea of a magnetic charge density, the Gilbert model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north/south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents.\\r\\nAfter ?rsted discovered that electric currents produce a magnetic field and Ampere discovered that electric currents attracted and repelled each other similar to magnets, it was natural to hypothesize that all magnetic fields are due to electric current loops. In this model developed by Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this loop is m = IA where A is the area of the loop.\\r\\nThese magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic B-field. One important property of the B-field produced this way is that magnetic B-field lines neither start nor end (mathematically, B is a solenoidal vector field); a field line either extends to infinity or wraps around to form a closed curve.[nb 9] To date, no exception to this rule has been found. (See magnetic monopole below.) Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet B-field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north.[nb 10] If a B-field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point. Magnetic poles, therefore, always come in N and S pairs.\\r\\nMore formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the 'number'[nb 11] of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to:\\r\\nwhere the integral is a surface integral over the closed surface S (a closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape). Since dA points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for B-field pointing out and negative for B-field pointing in.\\r\\nThere is also a corresponding differential form of this equation covered in Maxwell's equations below.\\r\\nThe force between two small magnets is quite complicated and depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and the distance and direction of the magnets relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field[nb 12] of the other.\\r\\nTo understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the magnetic pole model given above. In this model, the H-field of one magnet pushes and pulls on both poles of a second magnet. If this H-field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is nonuniform (such as the H near one of its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque.\\r\\nThis is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted (or repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet) into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non-uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way.\\r\\nThe details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted/repelled into regions of higher magnetic field. Mathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment m due to a magnetic field B is:[20]\\r\\nwhere the gradient ? is the change of the quantity m { B per unit distance and the direction is that of maximum increase of m { B. To understand this equation, note that the dot product m { B = mBcos(Ĳ), where m and B represent the magnitude of the m and B vectors and Ĳ is the angle between them. If m is in the same direction as B then the dot product is positive and the gradient points 'uphill' pulling the magnet into regions of higher B-field (more strictly larger m { B). This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own m then summing up the forces on each of these very small regions.\\r\\nIf two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a magnetic torque on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque  tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field.\\r\\nMagnetic torque is used to drive electric motors. In one simple motor design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a magnetic field from an array of electromagnets. By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft. See Rotating magnetic fields below.\\r\\nAs is the case for the force between magnets, the magnetic pole model leads more readily to the correct equation. Here, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same H also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance (perpendicular to the force) between them. With the definition of m as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to  = 0mHsinĲ, where 0 is a constant called the vacuum permeability, measuring 6993400000000000000?4G10?7 V{s/(A{m) and Ĳ is the angle between H and m.\\r\\nThe Amperian loop model also predicts the same magnetic torque. Here, it is the B field interacting with the Amperian current loop through a Lorentz force described below. Again, the results are the same although the models are completely different.\\r\\nMathematically, the torque  on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment m of the magnet:\\r\\nwhere G represents the vector cross product. Note that this equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if m is in the same direction as the magnetic field. (The cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction.) Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.\\r\\nCurrents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B-fields.\\r\\nAll moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving point charges, such as electrons, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.[21]\\r\\nMagnetic field lines form in concentric circles around a cylindrical current-carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the \\"right hand grip rule\\" (see figure at right). The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. (For an infinite length wire the strength is inversely proportional to the distance.)\\r\\nBending a current-carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or \\"solenoid\\" enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron core may act as an electromagnet, generating a strong, well-controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil.\\r\\nThe magnetic field generated by a steady current I (a constant flow of electric charges, in which charge neither accumulates nor is depleted at any point)[nb 13] is described by the BiotÿSavart law:\\r\\nwhere the integral sums over the wire length where vector d? is the vector line element with direction in the same sense as the current I, 0 is the magnetic constant, r is the distance between the location of d? and the location where the magnetic field is calculated, and r? is a unit vector in the direction of r. In the case of a sufficiently long wire, this becomes:\\r\\nwhere r is the distance from the wire.[22]\\r\\nA slightly more general[23][nb 14] way of relating the current \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {I}}\\r\\n\\r\\n to the B-field is through Ampre's law:\\r\\nwhere the line integral is over any arbitrary loop and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {I}}\\r\\n\\r\\nenc is the current enclosed by that loop. Ampre's law is always valid for steady currents and can be used to calculate the B-field for certain highly symmetric situations such as an infinite wire or an infinite solenoid.\\r\\nIn a modified form that accounts for time varying electric fields, Ampre's law is one of four Maxwell's equations that describe electricity and magnetism.\\r\\nA charged particle moving in a B-field experiences a sideways force that is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the charge of the particle. This force is known as the Lorentz force, and is given by\\r\\nwhere F is the force, q is the electric charge of the particle, v is the instantaneous velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field (in teslas).\\r\\nThe Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no work on an isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non-elementary magnetic dipole, or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect[24] because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.\\r\\nThe force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a charge carrying wire is a collection of moving charges. A current-carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field. The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the Laplace force. Consider a conductor of length ?, cross section A, and charge q due to electric current i. If this conductor is placed in a magnetic field of magnitude B that makes an angle Ĳ with the velocity of charges in the conductor, the force exerted on a single charge q is\\r\\nso, for N charges where\\r\\nthe force exerted on the conductor is\\r\\nwhere i = nqvA.\\r\\nThe direction of force on a charge or a current can be determined by a mnemonic known as the right-hand rule (see the figure). Using the right hand, pointing the thumb in the direction of the current, and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same current.) On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field can distinguish between these, see Hall effect below.\\r\\nAn alternative mnemonic to the right hand rule Flemings's left hand rule.\\r\\nThe formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own bound current, which can be a challenge to calculate. (This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current loops and the spin of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make up the material.) The H-field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of magnetization first.\\r\\nThe magnetization vector field M represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net magnetic dipole moment per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment m of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A?m2, the SI unit of magnetization M is ampere per meter, identical to that of the H-field.\\r\\nThe magnetization M field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. (Magnetization does not exist outside of the magnet.)\\r\\nIn the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called bound current. This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic B field due to the magnet. (See Magnetic dipoles below and magnetic poles vs. atomic currents for more information.) Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law:[25]\\r\\nwhere the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and Ib is the 'bound current' enclosed by that closed loop.\\r\\nIn the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive 'magnetic pole strength' (corresponding to a north pole) then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to:\\r\\nwhere the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface S and qM is the 'magnetic charge' (in units of magnetic flux) enclosed by S. (A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape.) The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.\\r\\nIn SI units, the H-field is related to the B-field by\\r\\nIn terms of the H-field, Ampere's law is\\r\\nwhere If represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of H does not depend at all on the bound currents.[26]\\r\\nFor the differential equivalent of this equation see Maxwell's equations. Ampere's law leads to the boundary condition\\r\\nwhere Kf is the surface free current density and the unit normal \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n^\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {\\\\mathbf {n} }}}\\r\\n\\r\\n points in the direction from medium 2 to medium 1.[27]\\r\\nSimilarly, a surface integral of H over any closed surface is independent of the free currents and picks out the \\"magnetic charges\\" within that closed surface:\\r\\nwhich does not depend on the free currents.\\r\\nThe H-field, therefore, can be separated into two[nb 15] independent parts:\\r\\nwhere H0 is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and Hd is the demagnetizing field due only to the bound currents.\\r\\nThe magnetic H-field, therefore, re-factors the bound current in terms of \\"magnetic charges\\". The H field lines loop only around 'free current' and, unlike the magnetic B field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.\\r\\nMost materials respond to an applied B-field by producing their own magnetization M and therefore their own B-field. Typically, the response is weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied. The term magnetism describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic phase of a material. Materials are divided into groups based upon their magnetic behavior:\\r\\nIn the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization M is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that:\\r\\nwhere  is a material dependent parameter called the permeability. In some cases the permeability may be a second rank tensor so that H may not point in the same direction as B. These relations between B and H are examples of constitutive equations. However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex B to H relation; see magnetic hysteresis.\\r\\nEnergy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive materials this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that this energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field.\\r\\nFor linear, non-dispersive, materials (such that B = H where  is frequency-independent), the energy density is:\\r\\nIf there are no magnetic materials around then  can be replaced by 0. The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used.\\r\\nIn general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume ѴW needed to cause a small change of magnetic field ѴB is:\\r\\nOnce the relationship between H and B is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For hysteretic materials such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non-dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.\\r\\nA changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an electric field (and therefore tends to drive a current in such a coil). This is known as Faraday's law and forms the basis of many electrical generators and electric motors.\\r\\nMathematically, Faraday's law is:\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\scriptstyle {\\\\mathcal {E}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the electromotive force (or EMF, the voltage generated around a closed loop) and m is the magnetic fluxthe product of the area times the magnetic field normal to that area. (This definition of magnetic flux is why B is often referred to as magnetic flux density.)[33]:210\\r\\nThe negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that opposes the change in the magnetic field that induced it. This phenomenon is known as Lenz's law.\\r\\nThis integral formulation of Faraday's law can be converted[nb 16] into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions. This form is covered as one of Maxwell's equations below.\\r\\nSimilar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as Maxwell's correction to Ampre's law and is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law as given above. This additional term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field.)\\r\\nThe full law including the correction term is known as the MaxwellÿAmpre equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used.\\r\\nThe Maxwell term is critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell's correction to Ampre's Law together with Faraday's law of induction describes how mutually changing electric and magnetic fields interact to sustain each other and thus to form electromagnetic waves, such as light: a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.\\r\\nLike all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its sources. (For B the sources are currents and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up Maxwell's Equations. Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of classical electrodynamics including both electricity and magnetism.\\r\\nThe first property is the divergence of a vector field A, ? { A, which represents how A 'flows' outward from a given point. As discussed above, a B-field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of B is zero. (Such vector fields are called solenoidal vector fields.) This property is called Gauss's law for magnetism and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or magnetic monopoles. The electric field on the other hand begins and ends at electric charges so that its divergence is non-zero and proportional to the charge density (See Gauss's law).\\r\\nThe second mathematical property is called the curl, such that ? G A represents how A curls or 'circulates' around a given point. The result of the curl is called a 'circulation source'. The equations for the curl of B and of E are called the AmpreÿMaxwell equation and Faraday's law respectively. They represent the differential forms of the integral equations given above.\\r\\nThe complete set of Maxwell's equations then are:\\r\\nwhere J = complete microscopic current density and  is the charge density.\\r\\nTechnically, B is a pseudovector (also called an axial vector) due to being defined by a vector cross product. (See diagram.)\\r\\nAs discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric E field and an applied magnetic B field by producing their own internal 'bound' charge and current distributions that contribute to E and B but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, H and D fields are used to re-factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the free current density Jf and free charge density f:\\r\\nThese equations are not any more general than the original equations (if the 'bound' charges and currents in the material are known). They also must be supplemented by the relationship between B and H as well as that between E and D. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.\\r\\nAccording to the special theory of relativity, the partition of the electromagnetic force into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the observational frame of reference: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces.\\r\\nFormally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank-2 tensor, called the electromagnetic tensor. Changing reference frames mixes these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity mixes space and time into spacetime, and mass, momentum and energy into four-momentum.[34]\\r\\nIn advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and relativity it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the vector potential A, and the scalar potential , are defined such that:\\r\\nThe vector potential A may be interpreted as a generalized potential momentum per unit charge[35] just as  is interpreted as a generalized potential energy per unit charge.\\r\\nMaxwell's equations when expressed in terms of the potentials can be cast into a form that agrees with special relativity with little effort.[36] In relativity A together with  forms the four-potential, analogous to the four-momentum that combines the momentum and energy of a particle. Using the four potential instead of the electromagnetic tensor has the advantage of being much simplerand it can be easily modified to work with quantum mechanics.\\r\\nIn modern physics, the electromagnetic field is understood to be not a classical field, but rather a quantum field; it is represented not as a vector of three numbers at each point, but as a vector of three quantum operators at each point. The most accurate modern description of the electromagnetic interaction (and much else) is quantum electrodynamics (QED),[37] which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the Standard Model of particle physics.\\r\\nIn QED, the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles (and their antiparticles) is computed using perturbation theory. These rather complex formulas produce a remarkable pictorial representation as Feynman diagrams in which virtual photons are exchanged.\\r\\nPredictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of accuracy: currently about 10?12 (and limited by experimental errors); for details see precision tests of QED. This makes QED one of the most accurate physical theories constructed thus far.\\r\\nAll equations in this article are in the classical approximation, which is less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here. However, under most everyday circumstances, the difference between the two theories is negligible.\\r\\nThe Earth's magnetic field is thought to be produced by convection currents in the outer liquid of Earth's core. The Dynamo theory proposes that these movements produce electric currents that, in turn, produce the magnetic field.[38]\\r\\nThe presence of this field causes a compass, placed anywhere within it, to rotate so that the \\"north pole\\" of the magnet in the compass points roughly north, toward Earth's North Magnetic Pole. This is the traditional definition of the \\"north pole\\" of a magnet, although other equivalent definitions are also possible.\\r\\nOne confusion that arises from this definition is that, if Earth itself is considered as a magnet, the south pole of that magnet would be the one nearer the north magnetic pole, and vice versa. The north magnetic pole is so-named not because of the polarity of the field there but because of its geographical location. The north and south poles of a permanent magnet are so-called because they are \\"north-seeking\\" and \\"south-seeking\\", respectively.[39][40]\\r\\nThe figure is a sketch of Earth's magnetic field represented by field lines. For most locations, the magnetic field has a significant up/down component in addition to the north/south component. (There is also an east/west component, as Earth's magnetic and geographical poles do not coincide.) The magnetic field can be visualised as a bar magnet buried deep in Earth's interior.\\r\\nEarth's magnetic field is not constantthe strength of the field and the location of its poles vary. Moreover, the poles periodically reverse their orientation in a process called geomagnetic reversal. The most recent reversal occurred 780,000 years ago.\\r\\nThe rotating magnetic field is a key principle in the operation of alternating-current motors. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was conceptualized by Nikola Tesla, and later utilized in his, and others', early AC (alternating current) electric motors.\\r\\nA rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with unequal currents.\\r\\nThis inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so, to overcome it, three-phase systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three-phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world's electrical power supply systems.\\r\\nSynchronous motors use DC-voltage-fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlledand induction motors use short-circuited rotors (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator. The short-circuited turns of the rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force.\\r\\nIn 1882, Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic field. In 1885, Galileo Ferraris independently researched the concept. In 1888, Tesla gained U.S. Patent 381,968 for his work. Also in 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin.\\r\\nThe charge carriers of a current-carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the Hall effect.\\r\\nThe Hall effect is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors (negative electrons or positive holes).\\r\\nAn important use of H is in magnetic circuits where B = H inside a linear material. Here,  is the magnetic permeability of the material. This result is similar in form to Ohm's law J = E, where J is the current density,  is the conductance and E is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law (I = V?R) is:\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nB\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Phi =\\\\int \\\\mathbf {B} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm {d} \\\\mathbf {A} }\\r\\n\\r\\n is the magnetic flux in the circuit, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nF\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nH\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle F=\\\\int \\\\mathbf {H} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm {d} {\\\\boldsymbol {\\\\ell }}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the magnetomotive force applied to the circuit, and Rm is the reluctance of the circuit. Here the reluctance Rm is a quantity similar in nature to resistance for the flux.\\r\\nUsing this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of circuit theory.\\r\\nThe magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is depicted in the figure. From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current I and an area a. Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of:\\r\\nwhere the direction of m is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area a has been reduced to zero and its current I increased to infinity such that the product m = Ia is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the Einsteinÿde Haas effect rotation by magnetization and its inverse, the Barnett effect or magnetization by rotation.[44] Rotating the loop faster (in the same direction) increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment, for example.\\r\\nIt is sometimes useful to model the magnetic dipole similar to the electric dipole with two equal but opposite magnetic charges (one south the other north) separated by distance d. This model produces an H-field not a B-field. Such a model is deficient, though, both in that there are no magnetic charges and in that it obscures the link between electricity and magnetism. Further, as discussed above it fails to explain the inherent connection between angular momentum and magnetism.\\r\\nA magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that has, as its name suggests, only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a south pole). In other words, it would possess a \\"magnetic charge\\" analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end.\\r\\nModern interest in this concept stems from particle theories, notably Grand Unified Theories and superstring theories, that predict either the existence, or the possibility, of magnetic monopoles. These theories and others have inspired extensive efforts to search for monopoles. Despite these efforts, no magnetic monopole has been observed to date.[nb 17]\\r\\nIn recent research, materials known as spin ices can simulate monopoles, but do not contain actual monopoles.[45][46]","input":"Who discovered the magnetic field of electric current?"},{"output":"Dilip Babasaheb Bhosale","context":"Principal Seat: Allahabad, U.P.\\r\\nThe Allahabad High Court or the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad is a high court based in Allahabad that has jurisdiction over the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

Consequently, Heyman, who had originally disliked \\"the rubbish title\\", read the book himself. Highly impressed by Rowling's work, he began the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises of all time.[11]\\r\\nHeyman's enthusiasm led to Rowling's 1999 sale of the film rights for the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported S1 million (US$2,000,000).[12] A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, allowing nevertheless for the inclusion of many Irish actors, such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such.[13] Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she \\"didn't want to give them control over the rest of the story\\" by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.[14]\\r\\nAlthough Steven Spielberg initially negotiated to direct the first film, he declined the offer.[15] Spielberg wanted the adaptation to be an animated film, with American actor Haley Joel Osment providing Harry Potter's voice.[16] Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, there was every expectation of profit in making the film. He claims that making money would have been like \\"shooting ducks in a barrel. It's just a slam dunk. It's just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank accounts. There's no challenge\\".[17] In the \\"Rubbish\\" Bin section of her website, Rowling maintains that she had no role in choosing directors for the films, writing \\"Anyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' him [Spielberg] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced.\\"[18]\\r\\nAfter Spielberg left, conversations began with other directors, including Chris Columbus, Jonathan Demme, Terry Gilliam, Mike Newell, Alan Parker, Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, Tim Robbins, Brad Silberling, and Peter Weir.[19] Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000.[20] It was then narrowed down to Columbus, Gilliam, Parker, and Silberling.[21] Rowling's first choice was Terry Gilliam.[22] However, on 28 March 2000 Columbus was appointed as director of the film, with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire as influences for their decision.[23]\\r\\nHarry Potter is the kind of timeless literary achievement that comes around once in a lifetime. Since the books have generated such a passionate following across the world, it was important to us to find a director that has an affinity for both children and magic. I can't think of anyone more ideally suited for this job than Chris [Columbus].\\r\\nSteve Kloves was selected to write the screenplay for the first film. He described adapting the book as \\"tough\\" since it did not \\"lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books\\". Kloves was sent a \\"raft\\" of synopses of books proposed as film adaptations, with Harry Potter being the only one that jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, becoming an instant fan. When speaking to Warner Bros. he stated that the film had to be British and true to the characters.[24] David Heyman was confirmed to produce the film.[23] Rowling received a large amount of creative control for the film, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.[25]\\r\\nWarner Bros. had initially planned to release the first film over the 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several of the originally proposed directors had withdrawn themselves from contention. Eventually, due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001.[26]\\r\\nIn 2000, after a seven-month search, lead actor Daniel Radcliffe was discovered by producer David Heyman and writer Steve Kloves seated just behind them in a theatre. In Heyman's own words, \\"There sitting behind me was this boy with these big blue eyes. It was Dan Radcliffe. I remember my first impressions: He was curious and funny and so energetic. There was real generosity too, and sweetness. But at the same time he was really voracious and with hunger for knowledge of whatever kind.\\" [11]\\r\\nRadcliffe had already established himself as an actor in the 1999 BBC television production of David Copperfield in which he played the title role's childhood years. Heyman persuaded Radcliffe's parents to allow him to audition for the part of Harry Potter, which involved Radcliffe being filmed.[11] (This screen test footage was released via the first set of Ultimate Editions in 2009.)[27] Rowling was enthusiastic after viewing Radcliffe's filmed test, saying she didn't think there was a better choice for the part of Harry Potter.[11][28]\\r\\nAlso in 2000, the then unknown British actors Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were selected from thousands of auditioning children to play the roles of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, respectively. Their only previous acting experience was in school plays. Grint was eleven years old and Watson ten at the time they were cast.[29]\\r\\nLos Angeles Times writer Geoff Boucher, who conducted the above-mentioned interview with Heyman, added that the casting of the three major roles \\"is especially impressive in hindsight. The trio's selection was arguably one of the best show-business decisions over the past decade... they have shown admirable grace and steadiness in the face of teen superstardom.\\"[11][28]\\r\\nFilming of the series began at Leavesden Studios, Hertfordshire, England, in September 2000 and ended in December 2010, with post-production on the final film lasting until summer 2011.[6] Leavesden Studios was the main base for filming Harry Potter, and it opened to the public as a studio tour in 2012 (renamed as Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden).[30]\\r\\nDavid Heyman produced all the films in the series with his production company Heyday Films, while David Barron joined the series as an executive producer on Chamber of Secrets and Goblet of Fire. Barron was later appointed producer on the last four films. Chris Columbus was an executive producer on the first two films alongside Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan, but he became a producer on the third film alongside Heyman and Radcliffe. Other executive producers include Tanya Seghatchian and Lionel Wigram. J. K. Rowling, author of the series, was asked to become a producer on Goblet of Fire but declined. She subsequently accepted the role on the two-part Deathly Hallows.[31]\\r\\nHeyday Films and Columbus' company 1492 Pictures collaborated with Duncan Henderson Productions in 2001, Miracle Productions in 2002, and P of A Productions in 2004. Even though Prisoner of Azkaban was the final film produced by 1492 Pictures, Heyday Films continued with the franchise and collaborated with Patalex IV Productions in 2005. The sixth film in the series, Half-Blood Prince, was the most expensive film to produce as of 2009[update].\\r\\nWarner Bros. split the seventh and final novel in the series, Deathly Hallows, into two cinematic parts. The two parts were filmed back-to-back from early 2009 to summer 2010, with the completion of reshoots taking place on 21 December 2010; this marked the end of filming Harry Potter. Heyman stated that Deathly Hallows was \\"shot as one film\\" but released in two feature-length parts.[32]\\r\\nTim Burke, the visual effects supervisor of the series, said of the production on Harry Potter, \\"It was this huge family; I think there were over 700 people working at Leavesden, an industry in itself.\\" David Heyman said, \\"When the first film opened, no way did I think we'd make eight films. That didn't seem feasible until after we'd done the fourth.\\" Nisha Parti, the production consultant on the first film, said that Heyman \\"made the first film very much the way he felt the studio Warner Bros. wanted to make it.\\" After the film's success, Heyman was given \\"more freedom\\".[33]\\r\\nOne of the aims of the filmmakers from the beginning of production was to develop the maturity of the films. Chris Columbus stated, \\"We realised that these movies would get progressively darker. Again, we didn't know how dark but we realised that as the kids get older, the movies get a little edgier and darker.\\"[34] This transpired with the succeeding three directors who would work on the series in the following years, with the films beginning to deal with issues such as death, betrayal, prejudice, and political corruption as the series developed narratively and thematically.[5][35]\\r\\nAfter Chris Columbus had finished working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, he was hired to direct the second film, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. The production started within a week after the release of the first film. Columbus was set to direct all entries in the series,[36] but he did not want to return for the third film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, claiming he was \\"burned out\\".[37] He moved to the position of producer, while Alfonso Cuar܇n was approached for the role of director. He was initially nervous about directing the instalment since he had not read any of the books or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct since he had immediately connected to the story.[38]\\r\\nBecause Cuar܇n decided not to direct the fourth instalment, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a new director had to be selected.[39] Mike Newell was chosen to direct the film, but he declined to direct the next film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which was given to David Yates, who also directed Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, becoming the only director to helm more than one film since Chris Columbus.\\r\\nChris Columbus said his vision of the first two films was of a \\"golden storybook, an old-fashioned look\\", while Alfonso Cuar܇n changed the visual tone of the series, desaturated the colour palette, and expanded the landscape around Hogwarts.[34][39] Mike Newell decided to direct the fourth film as a \\"paranoid thriller\\", while David Yates wanted to \\"bring a sense of jeopardy and character to the world\\".[40][41] Cuar܇n, Newell, and Yates have said that their challenge was striking a balance between making the films according to their individual vision, while working within a cinematic world already established by Columbus.[39][40][41]\\r\\nDavid Heyman commented on the \\"generosity of the directors\\" by revealing that \\"Chris spent time with Alfonso, Alfonso spent time with Mike and Mike spent time with David, showing him an early cut of the film, talking through what it means to be a director and how they went about [making the films].\\"[42]\\r\\nDavid Heyman also said, \\"I suppose Chris Columbus was the most conservative choice from the studio's point of view. But he expressed real passion.\\"[33] Producer Tanya Seghatchian said they were \\"more adventurous\\" in choosing a director for the third film and went straight to Alfonso Cuar܇n.[33] Mike Newell became the first British director of the series when he was chosen for the fourth film; Newell was considered to direct the first film before he dropped out.[33] David Yates directed the final films after David Heyman thought him capable of handling the edgy, emotional, and political material of the later novels.[43]\\r\\nAll the directors have been supportive of each other. Chris Columbus praised the character development in the films, while Alfonso Cuar܇n admired the \\"quiet poetry\\" of David Yates' films.[34][39] Mike Newell noted that each director had a different heroism, and David Yates views the first four films \\"respectfully and enjoy[s] them.\\"[40][41] Daniel Radcliffe said Yates \\"took the charm of the films that Chris made and the visual flair of everything that Alfonso did and the thoroughly British, bombastic nature of the film directed by Mike Newell\\" and added \\"his own sense\\" of realism.[44]\\r\\nSteve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film, which was penned by Michael Goldenberg. Kloves had direct assistance from J.K. Rowling, though she allowed him what he described as \\"tremendous elbow room\\". Rowling asked Kloves to remain faithful to the spirit of the books; thus, the plot and tone of each film and its corresponding book are virtually the same, albeit with some changes and omissions for purposes of cinematic style, time, and budget constraints. Michael Goldenberg also received input from Rowling during his adaptation of the fifth novel; Goldenberg was originally considered to adapt the first novel before the studio chose Kloves.[45]\\r\\nIn a 2010 interview, David Heyman briefly explained the book-to-film transition. He commented on Rowling's involvement in the series, stating that she understood that \\"books and films are different\\" and was \\"the best support\\" a producer could have. Rowling had overall approval on the scripts, which were viewed and discussed by the director and the producers. Heyman also said that Kloves was the \\"key voice\\" in the process of adapting the novels and that certain aspects from the books needed to have been excluded from the scripts due to the filmmakers' decision to keep the main focus on Harry's journey as a character, which would ultimately give the films a defined structure. Heyman mentioned that some fans \\"don't necessarily understand the adaptation process\\" and that the filmmakers would have loved to \\"have everything\\" from the books in the films but noted that it was not possible since they had \\"neither time nor cinematic structure\\" to do so. He finished by saying that adapting a novel to the screen is \\"a really considered process.\\"[46]\\r\\nBecause the films were being made as the novels were being published, the filmmakers had no idea of the story's outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his relationship with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, \\"The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, 'I know the movies can't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But I just ask you to be true to the characters; that's all I care about.'\\"[47] Kloves also said, \\"I don't know what compelled me to say this [to Rowling], but I said, 'I've just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me.\\"[47]\\r\\nAside from the three lead actors, other notable cast members include Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall. Richard Harris, who played the role of Professor Albus Dumbledore, died on 25 October 2002 causing the role to be re-cast for the third instalment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. David Heyman and director Alfonso Cuar܇n chose Michael Gambon to portray the character of Dumbledore, which he did for all succeeding films. Notable recurring cast members include Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, and Julie Walters as Molly Weasley.\\r\\nThe series has seen many returning crew members from various departments, including Tim Burke, visual effects supervisor; Peter Doyle, digital film colourist; Nick Dudman, make-up and creature effects designer; David Holmes, stunt double; Amanda Knight, make-up artist; Stephenie McMillan, set designer; Greg Powell, stunt coordinator; Jany Temime, costume designer; and Fiona Weir, casting director.\\r\\nThe production designer for all eight films is Stuart Craig. Assisted by Stephenie McMillan, Craig has created iconic sets pieces including the Ministry of Magic, the Chamber of Secrets, Malfoy Manor, and the layout for the CGI Horcrux Cave. Because the novels were being published as the films were being made, Craig was required to rebuild some sets for future films and alter the design of Hogwarts.[50]\\r\\nHe said, \\"In the early days, every time you saw the exterior of Hogwarts, it was a physical miniature,\\" which was made by craftsmen and occupied a large sound stage.[52][53] \\"We ended up with a profile of how Hogwarts looked, a skyline that actually I didn't design, and it wasn't always satisfactory, and as all the novels got written and movies got made there were new requirements [for buildings]. The [Astronomy Tower] definitely wasn't there originally, and so we were able to add that substantial piece. And in the last film, we needed an arena for the battle for Hogwarts ÿ the big courtyard outside doubled in size, and if you look at the first movie it wasn't there at all. There were quite some liberties taken with the continuity of Hogwarts.\\"[54] In the last film, Craig used a digital model instead of a miniature to \\"embrace the latest technology\\".[53]\\r\\nOn the method of creating the sets, Craig said he often started by sketching ideas onto a blank sheet of paper.[55] Stephanie McMillan also said that \\"each film always had plenty of new challenges,\\" citing the changes in visual style between directors and cinematographers as an example, along with the developing story in the novels. Due to J.K. Rowling's descriptions of various settings in the novels, Craig noted his \\"responsibility was to place it together\\".[56]\\r\\nCraig commented on his experience working in the studio environment: \\"I'm the production designer, but on a big movie like Harry Potter I may be responsible for 30 to 35 people; from the supervising art director, and a team of art directors and assistants, to draughtsmen and junior draughtsmen, and then on to model makers, sculptors and scenic artists.\\" He said, \\"Ten years ago, all the Harry Potter drawings were done in pencil. I would take my roughs and plans and sections and give them to a professional architectural illustrator, who would create concept art using pencil and colour wash on watercolour paper.\\" He said the process changed slightly throughout the years due to, what he called, the \\"digital revolution\\" of making films.[53]\\r\\nWhen filming of the series was completed, some of Craig's sets had to be rebuilt or transported for them to be displayed at the Warner Bros. studio tour.[52]\\r\\nSix directors of photography worked on the series: John Seale on the first film, Roger Pratt on the second and fourth, Michael Seresin on the third, S?awomir Idziak on the fifth, Bruno Delbonnel on the sixth, and Eduardo Serra on the seventh and eighth. Delbonnel was considered to return for both parts of Deathly Hallows, but he declined, stating that he was \\"scared of repeating\\" himself.[57] Delbonnel's cinematography in Half-Blood Prince gained the series its only Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. As the series progressed, each cinematographer faced the challenge of shooting and lighting older sets (which had been around since the first few films) in unique and different ways.[58] Chris Columbus said the series' vivid colouring decreased as each film was made.[34][59]\\r\\nMichael Seresin commented on the change of visual style from the first two films to Prisoner of Azkaban: \\"The lighting is moodier, with more shadowing and cross-lighting.\\" Seresin and Alfonso Cuar܇n moved away from the strongly coloured and brightly lit cinematography of the first two films, with dimmer lighting and a more muted colour palette being utilised for the succeeding five films.[60] After comparing a range of digital cameras with 35?mm film, Bruno Delbonnel decided to shoot the sixth movie, Half-Blood Prince, on film rather than the increasingly popular digital format. This decision was kept for the two-part Deathly Hallows with Eduardo Serra, who said that he preferred to work with film because it was \\"more technically accurate and dependable\\".[61]\\r\\nBecause the majority of Deathly Hallows takes place in various settings away from Hogwarts, David Yates wanted to \\"shake things up\\" by using different photographic techniques such as using hand-held cameras and very wide camera lenses.[62] Eduardo Serra said, \\"Sometimes we are combining elements shot by the main unit, a second unit, and the visual effects unit. You have to know what is being captured ÿ colours, contrast, et cetera ÿ with mathematical precision.\\" He noted that with Stuart Craig's \\"amazing sets and the story\\", the filmmakers could not \\"stray too far from the look of the previous Harry Potter films.\\"[61][63]\\r\\nAlong with continuous changes in cinematographers, there have been five film editors to work in post-production on the series: Richard Francis-Bruce edited the first instalment, Peter Honess the second, Steven Weisberg the third, Mick Audsley the fourth, and Mark Day films five through eight.\\r\\nThe Harry Potter series has had four composers. John Williams scored the first three films: Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Prisoner of Azkaban. However, the second entry was adapted and conducted by William Ross due to Williams's conflicting commitments. Williams also created Hedwig's Theme, which is used in every film in the series.\\r\\nAfter Williams left the series to pursue other projects, Patrick Doyle scored the fourth entry, Goblet of Fire, which was directed by Mike Newell, with whom Doyle had worked previously. In 2006, Nicholas Hooper started work on the score to Order of the Phoenix by reuniting with director David Yates. Hooper also composed the soundtrack to Half-Blood Prince but decided not to return for the final films.\\r\\nIn January 2010, Alexandre Desplat was confirmed to compose the score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 1.[64] The film's orchestration started in the summer with Conrad Pope, the orchestrator on the first three Harry Potter films, collaborating with Desplat. Pope commented that the music \\"reminds one of the old days.\\"[65] Desplat returned to score Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 in 2011.[66]\\r\\nDirector David Yates stated that he wanted John Williams to return to the series for the final installment, but their schedules did not align due to the urgent demand for a rough cut of the film.[67] The final recording sessions of Harry Potter took place on 27 May 2011 at Abbey Road Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra, orchestrator Conrad Pope, and composer Alexandre Desplat.[68]\\r\\nDoyle, Hooper, and Desplat introduced their own personal themes to their respective soundtracks, while keeping a few of John Williams's themes.\\r\\nThere have been many visual effects companies to work on the Harry Potter series. Some of these include Rising Sun Pictures, Double Negative, Cinesite, Framestore, and Industrial Light & Magic. The latter three have worked on all the films in the series, while Double Negative and Rising Sun Pictures began their commitments with Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, respectively. Framestore contributed by developing many memorable creatures and sequences to the series.[69] Cinesite was involved in producing both miniature and digital effects for the films.[70] Producer David Barron said that \\"Harry Potter created the UK effects industry as we know it. On the first film, all the complicated visual effects were done on the [US] west coast. But on the second, we took a leap of faith and gave much of what would normally be given to Californian vendors to UK ones. They came up trumps.\\" Tim Burke, the visual effects supervisor, said many studios \\"are bringing their work to UK effects companies. Every facility is fully booked, and that wasn't the case before Harry Potter. That's really significant.\\"[33]\\r\\nOn 12 June 2010, filming of the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 1 and Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 was completed with actor Warwick Davis stating on his Twitter account, \\"The end of an Era ÿ today is officially the last day of principal photography on 'Harry Potter' ÿ ever. I feel honoured to be here as the director shouts cut for the very last time. Farewell Harry & Hogwarts, it's been magic!\\".[71] However, reshoots of the epilogue scene were confirmed to begin in the winter of 2010. The filming was completed on 21 December 2010, marking the official closure of filming the Harry Potter franchise.[72] Exactly four years earlier on that day, author J. K. Rowling's official website revealed the title of the final novel in the series ÿ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[73]\\r\\nHarry Potter is an orphaned boy brought up by his unkind Muggle (non-magical) aunt and uncle. At the age of eleven, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid informs him that he is actually a wizard and that his parents were murdered by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Voldemort also attempted to kill one-year-old Harry on the same night, but his killing curse mysteriously rebounded and reduced him to a weak and helpless form. Harry became extremely famous in the Wizarding World as a result. Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learns about magic. During the year, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone which is being kept within the school.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their second year, which proves to be more challenging than the last. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, leaving students and ghosts petrified by an unleashed monster. Harry must face up to claims that he is the heir of Salazar Slytherin (founder of the Chamber), learn that he can speak Parseltongue, and also discover the properties of a mysterious diary, only to find himself trapped within the Chamber of Secrets itself.\\r\\nHarry Potter's third year sees the boy wizard, along with his friends, attending Hogwarts School once again. Professor R. J. Lupin joins the staff as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, while convicted murderer Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban Prison. The Ministry of Magic entrusts the Dementors of Azkaban to guard Hogwarts from Black. Harry learns more about his past and his connection with the escaped prisoner.\\r\\nDuring Harry's fourth year, Hogwarts plays host to a legendary event: the Triwizard Tournament. Three European schools participate in the tournament, with three 'champions' representing each school in the deadly tasks. The Goblet of Fire chooses Fleur Delacour, Viktor Krum, and Cedric Diggory to compete against each other. However, curiously, Harry's name is also produced from the Goblet thus making him a fourth champion, which results in a terrifying encounter with a reborn Lord Voldemort.\\r\\nHarry's fifth year begins with him being attacked by Dementors in Little Whinging. Later, he finds out that the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort's return. Harry is also beset by disturbing and realistic nightmares, while Professor Umbridge, a representative of Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry becomes aware that Voldemort is after a prophecy which reveals: \\"neither can live while the other survives\\". The rebellion involving the students of Hogwarts, secret organisation Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic, and the Death Eaters begins.\\r\\nIn Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters are increasing their terror upon the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore persuades his old friend Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as a professor as there is a vacancy to fill. There is a more important reason, however, for Slughorn's return. While in a Potions lesson, Harry takes possession of a strangely annotated school textbook, inscribed 'This is the property of the Half-Blood Prince'. Draco Malfoy struggles to carry out a deed presented to him by Voldemort. Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Harry secretly work together to discover the method on how to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all.\\r\\nAfter unexpected events at the end of the previous year, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are entrusted with a quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's secret to immortality ÿ the Horcruxes. It is supposed to be their final year at Hogwarts, but the collapse of the Ministry of Magic and Voldemort's rise to power prevents them from attending. The trio undergo a long journey with many obstacles in their path including Death Eaters, Snatchers, the mysterious Deathly Hallows, and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's mind becoming ever stronger.\\r\\nAfter destroying one Horcrux and discovering the significance of the three Deathly Hallows, Harry, Ron and Hermione continue to seek the other Horcruxes in an attempt to destroy Voldemort, who has now obtained the powerful Elder Wand. The Dark Lord discovers Harry's hunt for Horcruxes and launches an attack on Hogwarts School, where the trio return for one last stand against the dark forces that threaten the Wizarding and Muggle worlds.\\r\\nThe rights for the first four novels in the series were sold to Warner Bros. for S1,000,000 by J.K. Rowling. After the release of the fourth book in July 2000, the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was released on 16 November 2001. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $90 million in the United States alone, which set a record opening worldwide. The succeeding three motion picture adaptations followed suit in financial success, while garnering positive reviews from fans and critics. The fifth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was released by Warner Bros. on 11 July 2007 in English-speaking countries, except for the UK and Ireland, which released the movie on 12 July.[74] The sixth, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released on 15 July 2009 to critical acclaim and finished its theatrical run ranked as the number two grossing film of 2009 on the worldwide charts.\\r\\nThe final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was split into two cinematic parts: Part 1 was released on 19 November 2010, and Part 2, the conclusion to both the final film and the series, was released on 15 July 2011.[75] Part 1 was originally scheduled to be released in 3D and 2D,[76] but due to a delay in the 3D conversion process, Warner Bros. released the film only in 2D and IMAX cinemas. However, Part 2 was released in 2D and 3D cinemas as originally planned.[77]\\r\\nThe television broadcast rights for the series in the United States are currently held by DisneyÿABC Domestic Television, which typically airs the films on the Freeform network. Disney's contract is expected to end in June 2018, after which, NBCUniversal will take control of the rights, after their deal with Warner Bros. was made in August 2016.[78] The film series has accrued nearly 1.3 billion viewings since their television debutthe highest-watched franchise in television broadcast history.[79]\\r\\nAll the films have been a success financially and critically, making the franchise one of the major Hollywood \\"tent-poles\\" akin to James Bond, Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean. The series is noted by audiences for growing visually darker and more mature as each film was released.[34][80][81][82][83] However, opinions of the films generally divide book fans, with some preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films and others preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films.\\r\\nSome also feel the series has a \\"disjointed\\" feel due to the changes in directors, as well as Michael Gambon's interpretation of Albus Dumbledore differing from that of Richard Harris. Author J. K. Rowling has been constantly supportive of the films,[84][85][86] and evaluated Deathly Hallows as her favourite one in the series. She wrote on her website of the changes in the book-to-film transition, \\"It is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long. Obviously films have restrictions ÿ novels do not have constraints of time and budget; I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of my own and my readers' imaginations\\".[87]\\r\\nAt the 64th British Academy Film Awards in February 2011, J. K. Rowling, David Heyman, David Barron, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar܇n, Mike Newell, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema for the series.[105][106]\\r\\nIn addition, the American Film Institute recognised the entire series with a Special Award at the American Film Institute Awards in 2011.

However, others have pointed out that certain films in the series had uneven reviews, in contrast to the three films of The Lord of the Rings, for example, which were all critically acclaimed. This has been partially attributed to the Harry Potter franchise going through several directors with their own styles in contrast to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which was filmed in one massive undertaking by the same director, writer, and producer.[110][111]\\r\\nAlthough not successful at the Oscars, the Harry Potter series has gained success in many other award ceremonies, including the annual Saturn Awards and Art Directors Guild Awards.

He also obtained another Best Director nomination at the annual Saturn Awards, which also saw the film gain a Best Fantasy Film nomination.[122][123] Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 was released to critical acclaim, gaining a mix of audience awards. Part 2 of Deathly Hallows was also recognised at the Saturn Awards as well as the BAFTA Awards, where the film achieved a win for Best Special Visual Effects.[124]\\r\\nAs of 2015[update], the Harry Potter film series is the 4th highest-grossing film franchise of all time, with the eight films released grossing over $7.7?billion worldwide. Without adjusting for inflation, this is higher than the first 22 James Bond films and the six films in the Star Wars franchise.[125] Chris Columbus's Philosopher's Stone became the highest-grossing Harry Potter film worldwide upon completing its theatrical run in 2002, but it was eventually topped by David Yates's Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2, while Alfonso Cuar܇n's Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least.[126][127][128][129]\\r\\nSix films in the Harry Potter franchise  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Parts 1 & 2  have to date grossed around $216 million in IMAX theaters worldwide.[130]\\r\\nThe Harry Potter films and their success have been retrospectively considered to have had a significant impact on the film industry. They are cited as having helped redefine the Hollywood blockbuster in the 21st century by initiating a shift toward established media franchises forming the basis of successful films. In the wake of the final film's release, Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that the films \\"inspired every major studio to try to capture [its] alchemic formula, spawning a range of copycats and wannabes\\" and \\"also have shown Hollywood how to make a glossy blockbuster with an eye toward keeping costs down.\\"[151] A 2009 article from The Economist argued that the films were \\"in the vanguard\\" of adaptations of established properties being the modern film franchise model, citing The Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Trilogy as examples of successful film series that followed Harry Potter's suit.[150] Furthermore, the practice of splitting the finale of a film series into two back-to-back films began with the success of Deathly Hallows, and it would soon be replicated by The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Battle of the Five Armies, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn ÿ Parts 1 and 2, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ÿ Parts 1 and 2, and Avengers: Infinity War and its untitled sequel.[152]\\r\\nThe films are also widely credited with singlehandedly signalling the popularity of films based on children's and young adult literature in the 2000s and 2010s, correlating with the book series' own literary influence. Costance Grady and Aja Romano, commenting on the whole Harry Potter franchise's legacy for Vox in light of its 20th anniversary, wrote that youth-targeted literature has since become \\"a go-to well of ideas for Hollywood,\\" pointing to the successes of The Twilight Saga, The Hunger Games and The Divergent Series.[153]","input":"What is the first movie of harry potter?"},{"output":"June 8, 2013","context":"The Ottawa Redblacks (officially stylized by the Ottawa ownership group in all-caps as REDBLACKS)[4] (French: Le Rouge et Noir d'Ottawa)[5] are a professional Canadian football team based in Ottawa, Ontario. The team plays in the East Division of the Canadian Football League (CFL).\\r\\nStarting play in 2014, the Redblacks are the third CFL team to play in the city of Ottawa. The Ottawa Rough Riders, formed in 1876, were a founding member of the CFL in 1958 and played until 1996. A new Ottawa franchise was formed as the \\"Renegades\\" in 2002 and lasted until the end of the 2005 season.[6] The Redblacks won the 2016 Grey Cup Championship, which ended a 40-year Grey Cup championship drought for the City of Ottawa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ottawa Renegades abruptly ceased operations prior to the 2006 CFL season. The league liquidated the Renegades roster in a dispersal draft and placed the Ottawa CFL franchise up for sale, with the intent of eventually returning to the city.[7]\\r\\nOn March 25, 2008, Jeff Hunt, the owner of the Ontario Hockey League's Ottawa 67's spearheaded a group that was awarded a franchise. The team planned to begin play in 2010, but cracks in the concrete structure in the south stands of Frank Clair Stadium led to the demolition of those stands and delayed the start of team operations. The league then set a new date of 2013 for the team's debut, but lawsuits forced the delay of reconstruction of the stadium to be pushed back even further.[8] The team and league then announced plans to play at a remodelled Frank Clair Stadiumnow called TD Place Stadiumby 2014 if construction remained on schedule.[9][10][11] In 2008, the franchise was conditionally awarded the right to host the 2014 Grey Cup game,[12] but the owners preferred to postpone the game for a few years to give the franchise a better chance to play in the championship game.[9] In any event, after lawsuits and delays, the stadium renovations were not completed until 2014.[8] Hosting the Grey Cup is a condition included in the agreement of franchise ownership.[13] A C$7-million franchise fee was reported to have been paid to the CFL.[6]\\r\\nConcurrently, Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk had announced plans to bid for a Major League Soccer franchise to play in Ottawa, it being his intention to build a new soccer-specific stadium near the Senators' Scotiabank Place (now Canadian Tire Centre) in support of that plan. Questions arose about the stadium's design in terms of whether or not it could be used by a CFL team in place of the aging Frank Clair Stadium. However, the CFL and MLS groups could not come to any agreement on coordinating their plans. Furthermore, municipal officials questioned whether the city could support both CFL and MLS franchises.[14]\\r\\nIn April 2009, the staff of the City of Ottawa presented a report to city council on the merits of the soccer stadium and Lansdowne Park proposals. The city held public hearings based on the report, which questioned the necessity of the spending but gave a slight edge to the Lansdowne proposal. Councillors attempted to find out whether the SSE group would support sharing their stadium with a planned CFL franchise, but the SSE group rejected such a possibility. Consequently, on April 22, 2009, city council chose the Lansdowne proposal over the SSE proposal as its choice for an outdoor stadium. Negotiations were conducted over the next several months, leading to an August 26 presentation to council so that it could decide the fate of football in Ottawa in the foreseeable future.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn November 12 and 13, council held a public debate to discuss what should be done with the area at Lansdowne Park. Guest speakers included CFL Commissioner Mark Cohon and former Rough Riders Jock Climie and Mark Kosmos, who presented their case as to why the Lansdowne Live group was an important contributor to the city of Ottawa.[15] The following Monday, on November 16, it was reported that council had voted 15ÿ9 in favour of plans to redevelop Lansdowne Park to house a CFL team.[16] The ownership group was given until June 2010 to sort out the details of the redevelopment, with construction set to begin in the spring of 2011.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn June 28, 2010, after a twelve-hour meeting, city council approved the plan to redevelop Lansdowne Park by the same 15ÿ9 vote, all but securing a franchise in the nation's capital.[9][10] With construction on the stadium scheduled to begin in 2011, the earliest the team would have been able to play was the 2013 under the original time line.[17] However, a failed legal challenge and an Ontario Municipal Board hearing on the Lansdowne Park redevelopment project delayed the start of construction until 2013,[needs update] with completion targeted for the summer of 2015, although there were indications that the stadium could be opened for football as early as 2014.[8] Without a viable stadium, the debut of the team was necessarily pushed back accordingly.[13]\\r\\nOn October 10, 2012, the new franchise cleared its final political hurdle, when a 21ÿ3 vote by Ottawa City Council went in favour of Lansdowne redevelopment.[18] Construction on the north and south side stands was set to begin in October 2012.[19][needs update]\\r\\nOn January 30, 2013, Marcel Desjardins was named the first general manager in Redblacks history.[20] Desjardins named former Montreal Alouettes scouting director and New York Jets pro scout Brock Sunderland as his assistant GM shortly thereafter.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn December 6, 2013, Desjardins hired Rick Campbell as the team's first head coach. Campbell is the son of former Edmonton Eskimos coaching legend Hugh Campbell, who coached the team to five consecutive Grey Cups from 1978 to 1982.[21]\\r\\nOn July 3, 2014, the Ottawa Redblacks played their first regular season game in Winnipeg, against the Blue Bombers, scoring touchdowns on their first three possessions in the opening quarter, but ultimately losing the game 36ÿ28.[22] On July 18, 2014, the Redblacks earned their first regular-season win at their first home opener with a score of 18ÿ17 over the visiting Toronto Argonauts.[23] The Redblacks, like most expansion teams, struggled during the whole season, and finished last in the league with a 2ÿ16 record.[24]\\r\\nIn their second season in the league, the Redblacks brought in significant talent to improve the offence. The result was a greatly improved team that won 8 of its last 10 regular season games, finishing with a record of 12ÿ6 to finish atop the East Division and clinch a first round bye.[25] It was the first regular-season division title for an Ottawa-based team since 1978. On November 22, 2015 the Redblacks defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 35ÿ28 in the East Final to advance to the 103rd Grey Cup. In doing so, they became the first Ottawa CFL team to reach the Grey Cup since the 1981 Rough Riders. They also became the second-youngest team to reach a Grey Cup final, bettered only by the 1995 Baltimore Stallions. In their first ever Grey Cup appearance, the Redblacks lost 26ÿ20 to the Edmonton Eskimos.[26]\\r\\nThe Redblacks returned to the Grey Cup the following year, winning the franchise's first championship by defeating the heavily favored Calgary Stampeders 39ÿ33 in overtime.[27] Although they had struggled during the regular season, finishing with an 8ÿ9ÿ1 record, the Redblacks claimed the top spot in a weak Eastern Division. This earned them a bye into the Eastern Final where, because of the CFL's crossover playoff format, they faced the Western Division's Edmonton Eskimos, winning 35ÿ23.[28][29]\\r\\nThe team almost immediately made contact with previous Rough Riders owner Horn Chen regarding the Rough Riders name. The ownership group were well aware of the price they would have had to pay Chen for the Rough Riders' logo and wordmarks.[30] The Rough Riders name still retains popular currency among football fans in Ottawa. The Rough Riders played for 120 years, during which time they won the Grey Cup nine times.[31] However, in July 2010, the ownership group announced that while Chen had sold the Rough Riders intellectual propertiesincluding their trademarksto his group, the Rough Riders name would likely not be returning due to the objections of the Saskatchewan Roughriders.[32]\\r\\nOn December 6, 2012, the CFL opened voting for the name of the team, up until December 16, 2012, on www.nameourteams.com. It was speculated that the team would be called the Rush, but this was later debunked.[33] The Rush name was nonetheless included in a list of five potential names (Nationals, Voyageurs, Redblacks, and Raftsmen being the others) for the team in a focus group led by the team's owners in January 2013.[34]\\r\\nOn May 30, 2013, the website Sportslogos.net reported that the ownership group had filed copyright protection for the nickname \\"Redblacks\\" (and its French equivalent, Rouge et Noir) with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.[35] On June 8, 2013, the team confirmed it would be known as the Ottawa REDBLACKS. On the same day, the Redblacks also revealed their logo, an italicized version of the block \\"R\\" that appeared on the Rough Riders' helmets from 1975 to 1991 (with artistic ink traps) surrounded by a red outline inside a black saw blade.[36]\\r\\nPresently, the CFL does not consider the Redblacks (or for that matter, the Renegades) as the successors of the Rough Riders in the same way that it considers the three incarnations of the Alouettes to be one franchise.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne year before the Ottawa club hit the field for the 2014 CFL season they were allowed to draft four NCAA junior redshirts (players who would participate in the 2013 NCAA football season). The draft took place May 6, 2013. Ottawa had the last pick in the first 4 rounds of the draft (9, 18, 27, 36 overall selections). They selected Nolan MacMillan from Iowa, Connor Williams from Utah State, Kalonji Kashama from Eastern Michigan and Tyler Digby from Robert Morris.[37]\\r\\nThe 2013 CFL Expansion Draft was a three-round CFL draft held on December 16, 2013 which assigned players from existing CFL teams to the new Ottawa team. The structure of the draft was announced on January 19, 2011, which described one round for selecting import players and two rounds for selecting non-import players.[38] Ottawa selected three players from each of the eight existing teams for a total of 24 players. Ottawa was allowed to select eight import players and 16 non-import players with quarterbacks, kickers and punters eligible within their respective import/non-import categories. Ottawa was permitted to select a maximum of two quarterbacks and one kicker/punter, but not select any two of these three players from the same team. The CFL Commissioner was authorized to resolve any dispute related to player eligibility for the Expansion Draft process.[39]\\r\\nThe selections were announced live at cfl.ca on December 16, 2013.[40]\\r\\nOn July 18, 2014, at halftime of the first home game in franchise history, the Redblacks announced that they would be retiring all ten jersey numbers that were previously retired by the Ottawa Rough Riders.[41]\\r\\nRunning backs\\r\\nWide receivers\\r\\nDefensive linemen\\r\\nDefensive backs\\r\\nSpecial teams\\r\\n6-Game injured list\\r\\nPractice squad\\r\\nItalics indicate International player\\r\\nRoster updated 2017-08-27\\r\\nDepth Chart ?

Angel Island (California) is an island in San Francisco Bay. It is currently a State Park administered by California State Parks and a California Historical Landmark. The island was originally a fishing and hunting site for Coastal Miwok Indians, then it was a haven for Spanish explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala. Later, it was developed as a cattle ranch, then, starting with the Civil War, the island served as a U.S. Army post. During the island's Immigration Station period, the island held hundreds of thousands of immigrants, the majority from China, Japan, India and the Philippines. The detention facility was considered ideal because of its isolated location, making it very easy to control immigrants, contain outbreaks of disease, and enforce the new immigration laws.[4] The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the title Angel Island, U.S. Immigration Station, and is a National Historic Landmark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel Island Immigration Station, sometimes known as \\"Ellis Island of the West,\\" began construction in 1905 in an area known as China Cove. The main difference between Ellis Island and Angel Island was that the majority of the immigrants that traveled through Angel Island were from Asian countries, such as China, Japan, and India. The facility was created to monitor the flow of Chinese immigrants entering the country after the implementation of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. The Act only allowed entrance to merchants, clergy, diplomats, teachers, and students, barring laborers.[4] The Act did give the government an idea of how to begin to regulate immigration, and realize the potential effect of immigration on the economy.\\r\\nAt Ellis Island, only between one and three percent of all arriving immigrants were rejected; at Angel Island, the number was about 18 percent.[5] The Chinese were targeted due to the large influx of immigrants that were arriving in the United States. Chinese immigrants were seen as a threat because they occupied low-wage jobs, and after the economic downfall during the 1870s, Americans experienced serious unemployment problems. This resulted in increased discrimination against the Chinese, labeling them as unsuitable Americans due to their appearance and social status. After executing a series of restrictive laws prohibiting the majority of Chinese immigration, the detention center was opened in 1910. Immigrants arrived from 84 different countries, with Chinese immigrants accounting for the largest ethnic group to enter San Francisco until 1915 when Japanese immigrants outnumbered the Chinese for the first time.[4]\\r\\nThe length of time immigrants spent detained varied depending on how long the interrogation process lasted. For some it was only a few days and for others it lasted for months, the longest recorded stay being 22 months.[6] This was significantly different from Ellis Island which had more relaxed regulation, and allowed immigrants to enter the United States within the day they arrived at the Island. Interrogations lasted awhile because many of the immigrants held at the detention center had false paperwork. Chinese immigrants, mostly males, claimed to be sons of Chinese individuals who were American citizens. Since children of citizens are also considered U.S. citizens, regardless of where they are born, it is illegal to deny them entry if they can prove citizenship. Therefore, the concept of \\"paper sons\\" or less commonly \\"paper daughters\\" was constructed- children on paper, but without real familial ties. Chinese-American citizens agreed to this collaboration because they were provided with monetary incentives.[4]\\r\\nAs a result, the interrogation process was established to be very difficult and grueling to weed out the fraudulent individuals. The applicant would be called before a Board of Special Inquiry, composed of two immigrant inspectors, a stenographer, and a translator, if needed. Over the course of a few hours or days, the individual would be drilled with specific questions that only real applicants would know about, for instance, their family history, location of the village, their homes and so on. However, a way around these questions was preparing them months in advance with their sponsors and memorizing the answers. To ensure that the applicant was telling the truth, witnesses from the United States, who were often other family members, were called in to corroborate the applicants story. The \\"family members\\" sometimes lived across the country, which extended the process since their testimony had to be verified before proceeding. If there was any doubt that the applicant was lying then the questioning process was prolonged and if deviation was suspected from the testimony presented by the witnesses, then the applicant and the rest of the family would be in jeopardy of deportation.[7]\\r\\nSome applicants appealed the decision of the Board, resulting in a prolonged stay at the detention center because the process was so long and tedious. Additionally, the length of stay varied depending on what country the individual was coming from. Japanese immigrants often held documentation from government officials that expedited the process of entering the country. This resulted in the majority of detainees being Chinese since they had no other alternatives but to endure the questioning. Since the goal of Angel Island was to deport as many Chinese immigrants as possible, the whole process was much more intrusive and demanding for the Chinese compared to other applicants.[7]\\r\\nThe detention center was in operation for thirty years; however, there were many concerns about the sanitation and safety of the immigrants at Angel Island, which proved to be true in 1940 when the administration building burned down. As a result, all the immigrants were relocated to another facility. Since Congress repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943, the facility was not reopened as an immigration station. Instead, during World War II it served as a prisoner of war processing center by the U.S. military. After the war, Angel Island was abandoned and deteriorated. It wasnt until 1963 that the detention facility was converted to a state park and a museum commemorating the immigrants that passed through. However, the building was set for demolition until someone discovered verses the detainees wrote on the wall. Today, more than 200 poems have been recovered and restored, and all but the detention centers are currently available to the public.[7] It is approximated that one million immigrants were processed at Angel Island Immigration Station, roughly 175,000 were Chinese and 117,000 were Japanese. Between 75-82 percent entered America successfully.[6]\\r\\nThe predominantly Chinese immigrants who were detained at Angel Island were not welcomed in the United States. As recounted by one detained in 1940: \\"When we arrived, they locked us up like criminals in compartments like the cages at the zoo.\\" Held in these \\"cages\\" for weeks, often months, individuals were subjected to rounds of long and stressful interrogations to assess the legitimacy of their immigration applications. Immigrants were made to recall minute details about their home and claimed relationshow many steps led up to your front door? Who lived in the third house in the second row of houses in your village? The interpreters for the proceedings may have not have spoken the particular dialect of the immigrant competently; most Chinese immigrants were from southern China at that time, many spoke Cantonese. It was difficult to pass the interrogations, and cases were appealed many times over before one could leave the island and enter the United States. Often, successful immigrants produced elaborate instruction manuals that coached fellow detainees in passing interrogations; if anyone was caught with these manuals, they would most likely be deported. Those that failed these tests often feared the shame of returning to China, and would commit suicide before leaving, or on the ships back to their homeland.[8]\\r\\nMany of the detainees turned to poetry as expression, spilling their emotions onto the very walls that contained them. Many of these poems were written in pencil and ink, or in brush, and then carved into the wooden walls or floors.[9] Some of the poems are bitter and angry, placid and contemplative, or even hopeful.\\r\\nAmerica has power, but not justice.\\r\\nIn prison, we were victimized as if we were guilty.\\r\\nGiven no opportunity to explain, it was really brutal.\\r\\nI bow my head in reflection but there is nothing I can do.\\r\\nAnother example:\\r\\nI thoroughly hate the barbarians because they do not respect justice.\\r\\nThey continually promulgate harsh laws to show off their prowess.\\r\\nThey oppress the overseas Chinese and also violate treaties.\\r\\nThey examine for hookworms and practice hundreds of despotic acts.\\r\\nA more hopeful example:\\r\\nTwice I have passed through the blue ocean, experienced the wind and dust of journey.\\r\\nConfinement in the wooden building has pained me doubly.\\r\\nWith a weak country, we must all join together in urgent effort.\\r\\nIt depends on all of us together to roll back the wild wave.","input":"What was the difference between angel island and ellis island?"},{"output":"Pretty Little Liars","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPretty Little Liars is a series of young adult novels by Sara Shepard.

The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.[1] Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric  dated to the fifth millennium BC have been found in the Indus Valley Civilization. \\r\\nAlthough cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes or 110 million bales annually, accounting for 2.5% of the world's arable land. China is the world's largest producer of cotton, but most of this is used domestically. The United States has been the largest exporter for many years.[2] In the United States, cotton is usually measured in bales, which measure approximately 0.48 cubic meters (17 cubic feet) and weigh 226.8 kilograms (500 pounds).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four commercially grown species of cotton, all domesticated in antiquity:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two New World cotton species account for the vast majority of modern cotton production, but the two Old World species were widely used before the 1900s. While cotton fibers occur naturally in colors of white, brown, pink and green, fears of contaminating the genetics of white cotton have led many cotton-growing locations to ban the growing of colored cotton varieties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest evidence of cotton use in the Indian subcontinent has been found at the site of Mehrgarh and Rakhigarhi where cotton threads have been found preserved in copper beads; these finds have been dated to the Neolithic (5th millennium BC).[4][5] Cotton cultivation in the region is dated to the Indus Valley Civilization, which covered parts of modern eastern Pakistan and northwestern India between 3300 and 1300 BC.[6] The Indus cotton industry was well-developed and some methods used in cotton spinning and fabrication continued to be used until the industrialization of India.[7] Between 2000 and 1000 BC cotton became widespread across much of India.[8] For example, it has been found at the site of Hallus in Karnataka dating from around 1000 BC.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton bolls discovered in a cave near Tehuacn, Mexico, have at first been\\r\\ndated to as early as 5500 BC, but this date has been challenged.[10] More securely dated is the domestication of Gossypium hirsutum in Mexico between around 3400 and 2300 BC.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Peru, cultivation of the indigenous cotton species Gossypium barbadense has been dated, from a find in Ancon, to c 4200 BC,[12] and was the backbone of the development of coastal cultures such as the Norte Chico, Moche, and Nazca. Cotton was grown upriver, made into nets, and traded with fishing villages along the coast for large supplies of fish. The Spanish who came to Mexico and Peru in the early 16th century found the people growing cotton and wearing clothing made of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greeks and the Arabs were not familiar with cotton until the Wars of Alexander the Great, as his contemporary Megasthenes told Seleucus I Nicator of \\"there being trees on which wool grows\\" in \\"Indica\\".[citation needed] This may be a reference to \\"tree cotton\\", Gossypium arboreum, which is a native of the Indian subcontinent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Columbia Encyclopedia:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton has been spun, woven, and dyed since prehistoric times. It clothed the people of ancient India, Egypt, and China. Hundreds of years before the Christian era, cotton textiles were woven in India with matchless skill, and their use spread to the Mediterranean countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Iran (Persia), the history of cotton dates back to the Achaemenid era (5th century BC); however, there are few sources about the planting of cotton in pre-Islamic Iran. The planting of cotton was common in Merv, Ray and Pars of Iran. In Persian poets' poems, especially Ferdowsi's Shahname, there are references to cotton (\\"panbe\\" in Persian). Marco Polo (13th century) refers to the major products of Persia, including cotton. John Chardin, a French traveler of the 17th century who visited Safavid Persia, spoke approvingly of the vast cotton farms of Persia.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Han dynasty (207 BC - 220 AD), cotton was grown by Chinese peoples in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nEgyptians grew and spun cotton in the first seven centuries of the Christian era.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHandheld roller cotton gins had been used in India since the 6th century, and was then introduced to other countries from there.[16] Between the 12th and 14th centuries, dual-roller gins appeared in India and China. The Indian version of the dual-roller gin was prevalent throughout the Mediterranean cotton trade by the 16th century. This mechanical device was, in some areas, driven by water power.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spinning wheel was invented in India, between 500 and 1000 AD.[18] The earliest clear illustrations of the spinning wheel come from the Islamic world in the eleventh century.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the late medieval period, cotton became known as an imported fiber in northern Europe, without any knowledge of how it was derived, other than that it was a plant. Because Herodotus had written in his Histories, Book III, 106, that in India trees grew in the wild producing wool, it was assumed that the plant was a tree, rather than a shrub. This aspect is retained in the name for cotton in several Germanic languages, such as German Baumwolle, which translates as \\"tree wool\\" (Baum means \\"tree\\"; Wolle means \\"wool\\"). Noting its similarities to wool, people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep. John Mandeville, writing in 1350, stated as fact that \\"There grew there [India] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the endes of its branches. These branches were so pliable that they bent down to allow the lambs to feed when they are hungry.\\" (See Vegetable Lamb of Tartary.) By the end of the 16th century, cotton was cultivated throughout the warmer regions in Asia and the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton manufacture was introduced to Europe during the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula and Sicily. The knowledge of cotton weaving was spread to northern Italy in the 12th century, when Sicily was conquered by the Normans, and consequently to the rest of Europe. The spinning wheel, introduced to Europe circa 1350, improved the speed of cotton spinning.[20] By the 15th century, Venice, Antwerp, and Haarlem were important ports for cotton trade, and the sale and transportation of cotton fabrics had become very profitable.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Mughal Empire, which ruled in the Indian subcontinent from the early 16th century to the early 18th century, Indian cotton production increased, in terms of both raw cotton and cotton textiles. The Mughals introduced agrarian reforms such as a new revenue system that was biased in favour of higher value cash crops such as cotton and indigo, providing state incentives to grow cash crops, in addition to rising market demand.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest manufacturing industry in the Mughal Empire was cotton textile manufacturing, which included the production of piece goods, calicos, and muslins, available unbleached and in a variety of colours. The cotton textile industry was responsible for a large part of the empire's international trade.[23] India had a 25% share of the global textile trade in the early 18th century.[24] Indian cotton textiles were the most important manufactured goods in world trade in the 18th century, consumed across the world from the Americas to Japan.[25] The most important center of cotton production was the Bengal Subah province, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worm gear roller cotton gin, which was invented in India during the early Delhi Sultanate era of the 13thÿ14th centuries, came into use in the Mughal Empire some time around the 16th century,[27] and is still used in India through to the present day.[16] Another innovation, the incorporation of the crank handle in the cotton gin, first appeared in India some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire.[28] The production of cotton, which may have largely been spun in the villages and then taken to towns in the form of yarn to be woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the spinning wheel across India shortly before the Mughal era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase demand for cotton. The diffusion of the spinning wheel, and the incorporation of the worm gear and crank handle into the roller cotton gin, led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production during the Mughal era.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was reported that, with an Indian cotton gin, which is half machine and half tool, one man and one woman could clean 28 pounds of cotton per day. With a modified Forbes version, one man and a boy could produce 250 pounds per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a few people's labour was used to feed them, they could produce as much work as 750 people did formerly.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, a Frenchman named M. Jumel proposed to the great ruler of Egypt, Mohamed Ali Pasha, that he could earn a substantial income by growing an extra-long staple Maho (Gossypium barbadense) cotton, in Lower Egypt, for the French market. Mohamed Ali Pasha accepted the proposition and granted himself the monopoly on the sale and export of cotton in Egypt; and later dictated cotton should be grown in preference to other crops.\\r\\n\\r\\nEgypt under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century had the fifth most productive cotton industry in the world, in terms of the number of spindles per capita.[31] The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as animal power, water wheels, and windmills, which were also the principal energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870.[32] It was under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century that steam engines were introduced to the Egyptian cotton industry.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time of the American Civil war annual exports had reached $16 million (120,000 bales), which rose to $56 million by 1864, primarily due to the loss of the Confederate supply on the world market. Exports continued to grow even after the reintroduction of US cotton, produced now by a paid workforce, and Egyptian exports reached 1.2 million bales a year by 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English East India Company introduced the Britain to cheap calico and chintz cloth on the restoration of the monarchy in the 1660s. Initially imported as a novelty side line, from its spice trading posts in Asia, the cheap colourful cloth proved popular and overtook the EIC's spice trade by value in the late 17th century. The EIC embraced the demand, particularly for calico, by expanding its factories in Asia and producing and importing cloth in bulk, creating competition for domestic woollen and linen textile producers. The impacted weavers, spinners, dyers, shepherds and farmers objected and the calico question became one of the major issues of National politics between the 1680s and the 1730s. Parliament began to see a decline in domestic textile sales, and an increase in imported textiles from places like China and India. Seeing the East India Company and their textile importation as a threat to domestic textile businesses, Parliament passed the 1700 Calico Act, blocking the importation of cotton cloth. As there was no punishment for continuing to sell cotton cloth, smuggling of the popular material became commonplace. In 1721, dissatisfied with the results of the first act, Parliament passed a stricter addition, this time prohibiting the sale of most cottons, imported and domestic (exempting only thread Fustian and raw cotton). The exemption of raw cotton from the prohibition initially saw 2 thousand bales of cotton imported annually, to become the basis of a new indigenous industry, initially producing Fustian for the domestic market, though more importantly triggering the development of a series of mechanised spinning and weaving technologies, to process the material. This mechanised production was concentrated in new cotton mills, which slowly expanded till by the beginning of the 1770s seven thousand bales of cotton were imported annually, and pressure was put on Parliament, by the new mill owners, to remove the prohibition on the production and sale of pure cotton cloth, as they could easily compete with anything the EIC could import.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe acts were repealed in 1774, triggering a wave of investment in mill based cotton spinning and production, doubling the demand for raw cotton within a couple of years, and doubling it again every decade, into the 1840s[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian cotton textiles, particularly those from Bengal, continued to maintain a competitive advantage up until the 19th century. In order to compete with India, Britain invested in labour-saving technical progress, while implementing protectionist policies such as bans and tariffs to restrict Indian imports.[34] At the same time, the East India Company's rule in India contributed to its deindustrialization, opening up a new market for British goods,[34] while the capital amassed from Bengal after its 1757 conquest was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth.[35][36][37] British colonization also forced open the large Indian market to British goods, which could be sold in India without tariffs or duties, compared to local Indian producers who were heavily taxed, while raw cotton was imported from India without tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton, giving Britain a monopoly over India's large market and cotton resources.[38][34][39] India served as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British manufacturers and a large captive market for British manufactured goods.[40] Britain eventually surpassed India as the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia's cotton-processing sector changed during EIC expansion in India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. From focusing on supplying the British market to supplying East Asia with raw cotton. As the Artisan produced textiles were no longer competitive with those produced Industrially, and Europe preferring the cheaper slave produced, long staple American, and Egyptian cottons, for its own materials.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advent of the Industrial Revolution in Britain provided a great boost to cotton manufacture, as textiles emerged as Britain's leading export. In 1738, Lewis Paul and John Wyatt, of Birmingham, England, patented the roller spinning machine, as well as the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds. Later, the invention of the James Hargreaves' spinning jenny in 1764, Richard Arkwright's spinning frame in 1769 and Samuel Crompton's spinning mule in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on, the British city of Manchester acquired the nickname \\"Cottonopolis\\" due to the cotton industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the heart of the global cotton trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction capacity in Britain and the United States was improved by the invention of the modern cotton gin by the American Eli Whitney in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s, a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor,[41] making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796.[41] Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1840s, India was no longer capable of supplying the vast quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories, while shipping bulky, low-price cotton from India to Britain was time-consuming and expensive. This, coupled with the emergence of American cotton as a superior type (due to the longer, stronger fibers of the two domesticated Native American species, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense), encouraged British traders to purchase cotton from plantations in the United States and plantations in the Caribbean. By the mid-19th century, \\"King Cotton\\" had become the backbone of the southern American economy. In the United States, cultivating and harvesting cotton became the leading occupation of slaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the American Civil War, American cotton exports slumped due to a Union blockade on Southern ports, and also because of a strategic decision by the Confederate government to cut exports, hoping to force Britain to recognize the Confederacy or enter the war. This prompted the main purchasers of cotton, Britain and France, to turn to Egyptian cotton. British and French traders invested heavily in cotton plantations. The Egyptian government of Viceroy Isma'il took out substantial loans from European bankers and stock exchanges. After the American Civil War ended in 1865, British and French traders abandoned Egyptian cotton and returned to cheap American exports,[citation needed] sending Egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring bankruptcy in 1876, a key factor behind Egypt's occupation by the British Empire in 1882.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time, cotton cultivation in the British Empire, especially Australia and India, greatly increased to replace the lost production of the American South. Through tariffs and other restrictions, the British government discouraged the production of cotton cloth in India; rather, the raw fiber was sent to England for processing. The Indian Mahatma Gandhi described the process:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, Southern cotton provided capital for the continuing development of the North. The cotton was largely produced through the labor of enslaved African Americans. It enriched both the Southern landowners and the Northern merchants. Much of the Southern cotton was trans-shipped through northern ports. In this era the slogan \\"Cotton is king\\" characterized the attitude of the South toward this monocrop.\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton remained a key crop in the Southern economy after emancipation and the end of the Civil War in 1865. Across the South, sharecropping evolved, in which landless black and white farmers worked land owned by others in return for a share of the profits. Some farmers rented the land and bore the production costs themselves. Until mechanical cotton pickers were developed, cotton farmers needed additional labor to hand-pick cotton. Picking cotton was a source of income for families across the South. Rural and small town school systems had split vacations so children could work in the fields during \\"cotton-picking.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until the 1950s that reliable harvesting machinery was introduced (prior to this, cotton-harvesting machinery had been too clumsy to pick cotton without shredding the fibers).[citation needed] During the first half of the 20th century, employment in the cotton industry fell, as machines began to replace laborers and the South's rural labor force dwindled during the World Wars.\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton remains a major export of the southern United States, and a majority of the world's annual cotton crop is of the long-staple American variety.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuccessful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from 60 to 120?cm (24 to 47?in)[citation needed]. Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests.[44] Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only produced with heavy reliance on irrigation water drawn from the Ogallala Aquifer.\\r\\nSince cotton is somewhat salt and drought tolerant, this makes it an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As water resources get tighter around the world, economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict, as well as potential environmental problems.[45][46][47][48][49] For example, improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan, where cotton is a major export. In the days of the Soviet Union, the Aral Sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation, largely of cotton, and now salination is widespread.[48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton can also be cultivated to have colors other than the yellowish off-white typical of modern commercial cotton fibers. Naturally colored cotton can come in red, green, and several shades of brown.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetically modified (GM) cotton was developed to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to a small fraction of insects, most notably the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, and flies, and harmless to other forms of life.[51][52][53] The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called Bt cotton, to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests, however, such as plant bugs, stink bugs, and aphids; depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides against these. A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds.[54] However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this.[55] They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm. The secondary pests were mostly miridae (plant bugs) whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied. Moreover, the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption. A 2012 Chinese study concluded that Bt cotton halved the use of pesticides and doubled the level of ladybirds, lacewings and spiders.[56][57] The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) said that, worldwide, GM cotton was planted on an area of 25 million hectares in 2011.[58] This was 69% of the worldwide total area planted in cotton.\\r\\n\\r\\nGM cotton acreage in India grew at a rapid rate, increasing from 50,000 hectares in 2002 to 10.6 million hectares in 2011. The total cotton area in India was 12.1 million hectares in 2011, so GM cotton was grown on 88% of the cotton area. This made India the country with the largest area of GM cotton in the world.[58] A long-term study on the economic impacts of Bt cotton in India, published in the Journal PNAS in 2012, showed that Bt cotton has increased yields, profits, and living standards of smallholder farmers.[59] The U.S. GM cotton crop was 4.0 million hectares in 2011 the second largest area in the world, the Chinese GM cotton crop was third largest by area with 3.9 million hectares and Pakistan had the fourth largest GM cotton crop area of 2.6 million hectares in 2011.[58] The initial introduction of GM cotton proved to be a success in Australia?ÿ the yields were equivalent to the non-transgenic varieties and the crop used much less pesticide to produce (85% reduction).[60] The subsequent introduction of a second variety of GM cotton led to increases in GM cotton production until 95% of the Australian cotton crop was GM in 2009[61] making Australia the country with the fifth largest GM cotton crop in the world.[58] Other GM cotton growing countries in 2011 were Argentina, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, South Africa and Costa Rica.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton has been genetically modified for resistance to glyphosate a broad-spectrum herbicide discovered by Monsanto which also sells some of the Bt cotton seeds to farmers. There are also a number of other cotton seed companies selling GM cotton around the world. About 62% of the GM cotton grown from 1996 to 2011 was insect resistant, 24% stacked product and 14% herbicide resistant.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton has gossypol, a toxin that makes it inedible. However, scientists have silenced the gene that produces the toxin, making it a potential food crop.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganic cotton is generally understood as cotton from plants not genetically modified and that is certified to be grown without the use of any synthetic agricultural chemicals, such as fertilizers or pesticides.[63] Its production also promotes and enhances biodiversity and biological cycles.[64] In the United States, organic cotton plantations are required to enforce the National Organic Program (NOP). This institution determines the allowed practices for pest control, growing, fertilizing, and handling of organic crops.[65] As of 2007, 265,517 bales of organic cotton were produced in 24 countries, and worldwide production was growing at a rate of more than 50% per year.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cotton industry relies heavily on chemicals, such as herbicides, fertilizers and insecticides, although a very small number of farmers are moving toward an organic model of production, and organic cotton products are now available for purchase at limited locations. These are popular for baby clothes and diapers. Under most definitions, organic products do not use genetic engineering. All natural cotton products are known to be both sustainable and hypoallergenic.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, in North America, one of the most economically destructive pests in cotton production has been the boll weevil. Due to the US Department of Agriculture's highly successful Boll Weevil Eradication Program (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered Bt cotton (which contains a bacterial gene that codes for a plant-produced protein that is toxic to a number of pests such as cotton bollworm and pink bollworm), has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther significant global pests of cotton include the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella; the chili thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis; the cotton seed bug, Oxycarenus hyalinipennis; the tarnish plant bug, Lygus lineolaris; and the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is harvested mechanically, either by a cotton picker, a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton continues to be picked by hand in developing countries.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe era of manufactured fibers began with the development of rayon in France in the 1890s. Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials. A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades. Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924. Nylon, the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's acrylic in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's hosiery from nylon, but it was not until the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat.[68] The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central American countries, such as Nicaragua, where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides. Cotton production recovered in the 1970s, but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton is used to make a number of textile products. These include terrycloth for highly absorbent bath towels and robes; denim for blue jeans; cambric, popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from which we get the term \\"blue-collar\\"); and corduroy, seersucker, and cotton twill. Socks, underwear, and most T-shirts are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in crochet and knitting. Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with linen as Linen-cotton blends which give benefit of both plant materials which wrinkle resistant, lightweight,  breathable and can keep heat more effectively than only linen. These blends are thinner and lighter, but stronger than only cotton.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the textile industry, cotton is used in fishing nets, coffee filters, tents, explosives manufacture (see nitrocellulose), cotton paper, and in bookbinding. The first Chinese paper was made of cotton fiber.[citation needed] Fire hoses were once made of cotton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cottonseed which remains after the cotton is ginned is used to produce cottonseed oil, which, after refining, can be consumed by humans like any other vegetable oil. The cottonseed meal that is left generally is fed to ruminant livestock; the gossypol remaining in the meal is toxic to monogastric animals. Cottonseed hulls can be added to dairy cattle rations for roughage. During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient, that is, to induce a miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found in all parts of the cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm. Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton linters are fine, silky fibers which adhere to the seeds of the cotton plant after ginning. These curly fibers typically are less than 1?8 inch (3.2?mm) long. The term also may apply to the longer textile fiber staple lint as well as the shorter fuzzy fibers from some upland species. Linters are traditionally used in the manufacture of paper and as a raw material in the manufacture of cellulose. In the UK, linters are referred to as \\"cotton wool\\". This can also be a refined product (absorbent cotton in U.S. usage) which has medical, cosmetic and many other practical uses. The first medical use of cotton wool was by Sampson Gamgee at the Queen's Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, England.\\r\\n\\r\\nShiny cotton is a processed version of the fiber that can be made into cloth resembling satin for shirts and suits.[72] However, it is hydrophobic (does not absorb water easily), which makes it unfit for use in bath and dish towels (although examples of these made from shiny cotton are seen).\\r\\n\\r\\nLong staple (LS cotton) is cotton of a longer fibre length and therefore of higher quality, while Extra-long staple cotton (ELS cotton) has longer fibre length still and of even higher quality. The name \\"Egyptian cotton\\" is broadly associated high quality cottons and is often an LS or (less often) an ELS cotton.[73] The American cotton variety Pima cotton is often compared to Egyptian cotton, as both are used in high quality bed sheets and other cotton products. While Pima cotton is often grown in the American southwest[citation needed], the Pima name is now used by cotton-producing nations such as Peru, Australia and Israel.[74] Not all products bearing the Pima name are made with the finest cotton: American-grown ELS Pima cotton is trademarked as Supima? cotton.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton lisle is a finely-spun, tightly twisted type of cotton that is noted for being strong and durable. Lisle is composed of two strands that have each been twisted an extra twist per inch than ordinary yarns and combined to create a single thread. The yarn is spun so that it is compact and solid. This cotton is used mainly for underwear, stockings, and gloves. Colors applied to this yarn are noted for being more brilliant than colors applied to softer yarn. This type of thread was first made in the city of Lisle, France (now Lille), hence its name.[76][77][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest producers of cotton, currently (2009), are China and India, with annual production of about 34 million bales and 33.4 million bales, respectively; most of this production is consumed by their respective textile industries. The largest exporters of raw cotton are the United States, with sales of $4.9 billion, and Africa, with sales of $2.1 billion. The total international trade is estimated to be $12 billion. Africa's share of the cotton trade has doubled since 1980. Neither area has a significant domestic textile industry, textile manufacturing having moved to developing nations in Eastern and South Asia such as India and China. In Africa, cotton is grown by numerous small holders. Dunavant Enterprises, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the leading cotton broker in Africa, with hundreds of purchasing agents. It operates cotton gins in Uganda, Mozambique, and Zambia. In Zambia, it often offers loans for seed and expenses to the 180,000 small farmers who grow cotton for it, as well as advice on farming methods. Cargill also purchases cotton in Africa for export.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 25,000 cotton growers in the United States are heavily subsidized at the rate of $2 billion per year although China now provides the highest overall level of cotton sector support.[79] The future of these subsidies is uncertain and has led to anticipatory expansion of cotton brokers' operations in Africa. Dunavant expanded in Africa by buying out local operations. This is only possible in former British colonies and Mozambique; former French colonies continue to maintain tight monopolies, inherited from their former colonialist masters, on cotton purchases at low fixed prices.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe five leading exporters of cotton in 2011 are (1) the United States, (2) India, (3) Brazil, (4) Australia, and (5) Uzbekistan. The largest nonproducing importers are Korea, Taiwan, Russia, and Japan.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn India, the states of Maharashtra (26.63%), Gujarat (17.96%) and Andhra Pradesh (13.75%) and also Madhya Pradesh are the leading cotton producing states,[83] these states have a predominantly tropical wet and dry climate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the state of Texas led in total production as of 2004,[84] while the state of California had the highest yield per acre.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton is an enormously important commodity throughout the world. However, many farmers in developing countries receive a low price for their produce, or find it difficult to compete with developed countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has led to an international dispute (see United States?ÿ Brazil cotton dispute):\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 27 September 2002, Brazil requested consultations with the US regarding prohibited and actionable subsidies provided to US producers, users and/or exporters of upland cotton, as well as legislation, regulations, statutory instruments and amendments thereto providing such subsidies (including export credits), grants, and any other assistance to the US producers, users and exporters of upland cotton.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 September 2004, the Panel Report recommended that the United States \\"withdraw\\" export credit guarantees and payments to domestic users and exporters, and \\"take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or withdraw\\" the mandatory price-contingent subsidy measures.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Brazil was fighting the US through the WTO's Dispute Settlement Mechanism against a heavily subsidized cotton industry, a group of four least-developed African countries?ÿ Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali?ÿ also known as \\"Cotton-4\\" have been the leading protagonist for the reduction of US cotton subsidies through negotiations. The four introduced a \\"Sectoral Initiative in Favour of Cotton\\", presented by Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaor during the Trade Negotiations Committee on 10 June 2003.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to concerns over subsidies, the cotton industries of some countries are criticized for employing child labor and damaging workers' health by exposure to pesticides used in production. The Environmental Justice Foundation has campaigned against the prevalent use of forced child and adult labor in cotton production in Uzbekistan, the world's third largest cotton exporter.[89] The international production and trade situation has led to \\"fair trade\\" cotton clothing and footwear, joining a rapidly growing market for organic clothing, fair fashion or \\"ethical fashion\\". The fair trade system was initiated in 2005 with producers from Cameroon, Mali and Senegal.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton is bought and sold by investors and price speculators as a tradable commodity on 2 different commodity exchanges in the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nA temperature range of 25 to 35?C (77 to 95?F) is the optimal range for mold development. At temperatures below 0?C (32?F), rotting of wet cotton stops. Damaged cotton is sometimes stored at these temperatures to prevent further deterioration.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nEgypt has a unique climatic temperature that the soil and the temperature provide an exceptional environment for cotton to grow rapidly. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe chemical composition of cotton is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a public effort to sequence the genome of cotton. It was started in 2007 by a consortium of public researchers.[95]  Their aim is to sequence the genome of cultivated, tetraploid cotton. \\"Tetraploid\\" means that its nucleus has two separate genomes, called A and D. The consortium agreed to first sequence the D-genome wild relative of cultivated cotton (G. raimondii, a Central American species) because it is small and has few repetitive elements. It has nearly one-third of the bases of tetraploid cotton, and each chromosome occurs only once.[clarification needed] Then, the A genome of G. arboreum would be sequenced. Its genome is roughly twice that of G. raimondii. Part of the difference in size is due the amplification of retrotransposons (GORGE). After both diploid genomes are assembled, they would be used as models for sequencing the genomes of tetraploid cultivated species. Without knowing the diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of AD genomes would co-assemble, and their repetitive elements would assemble independently into A and D sequences respectively. There would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids, as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, the companies Monsanto and Illumina completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of G. raimondii about 50x.[96] They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled from all of this raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, but much work remains.","input":"Where is most of the world's cotton grown?"},{"output":"uterus","context":"The female reproductive system is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in reproduction of new offspring. In the human the female reproductive system is immature at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes, and to carry a fetus to full term. The internal sex organs are the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the fetus. The uterus also produces vaginal and uterine secretions which help the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes. The ovaries produce the ova (egg cells). The external sex organs are also known as the genitals and these are the organs of the vulva including the labia, clitoris, and vaginal opening. The vagina is connected to the uterus at the cervix.[1]\\r\\nAt certain intervals, the ovaries release an ovum, which passes through the Fallopian tube into the uterus. If, in this transit, it meets with sperm, a single sperm can enter and merge with the egg, fertilizing it.\\r\\nFertilization usually occurs in the Fallopian tubes and marks the beginning of embryogenesis. The zygote will then divide over enough generations of cells to form a blastocyst, which implants itself in the wall of the uterus. This begins the period of gestation and the embryo will continue to develop until full-term. When the fetus has developed enough to survive outside the uterus, the cervix dilates and contractions of the uterus propel the newborn through the birth canal (the vagina).\\r\\nThe corresponding equivalent among males is the male reproductive system.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthumb|right|External female genital organs\\r\\nThe vulva consists of all of the external parts and tissues and includes the mons pubis, pudendal cleft, labia majora, labia minora, Bartholin's glands, clitoris, and vaginal opening.\\r\\nthumb|right|Sexually aroused vulva\\r\\nThe female internal reproductive organs are the vagina, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries.\\r\\nThe vagina is a fibromuscular (made up of fibrous and muscular tissue) canal leading from the outside of the body to the cervix of the uterus or womb. It is also referred to as the birth canal in the context of pregnancy. The vagina accommodates the male penis during sexual intercourse. Semen containing spermatozoa is ejaculated from the male at orgasm, into the vagina potentially enabling fertilization of the egg cell (ovum) to take place.\\r\\nThe cervix is the neck of the uterus, the lower, narrow portion where it joins with the upper part of the vagina. It is cylindrical or conical in shape and protrudes through the upper anterior vaginal wall. Approximately half its length is visible, the remainder lies above the vagina beyond view. The vagina has a thick layer outside and it is the opening where the fetus emerges during delivery.\\r\\nThe uterus or womb is the major female reproductive organ. The uterus provides mechanical protection, nutritional support, and waste removal for the developing embryo (weeks 1 to 8) and fetus (from week 9 until the delivery). In addition, contractions in the muscular wall of the uterus are important in pushing out the fetus at the time of birth.\\r\\nThe uterus contains three suspensory ligaments that help stabilize the position of the uterus and limits its range of movement. The uterosacral ligaments keep the body from moving inferiorly and anteriorly. The round ligaments restrict posterior movement of the uterus. The cardinal ligaments also prevent the inferior movement of the uterus.\\r\\nThe uterus is a pear-shaped muscular organ. Its major function is to accept a fertilized ovum which becomes implanted into the endometrium, and derives nourishment from blood vessels which develop exclusively for this purpose. The fertilized ovum becomes an embryo, develops into a fetus and gestates until childbirth. If the egg does not embed in the wall of the uterus, a female begins menstruation.\\r\\nThe Fallopian tubes are two tubes leading from the ovaries into the uterus. On maturity of an ovum, the follicle and the ovary's wall rupture, allowing the ovum to escape and enter the Fallopian tube. There it travels toward the uterus, pushed along by movements of cilia on the inner lining of the tubes. This trip takes hours or days. If the ovum is fertilized while in the Fallopian tube, then it normally implants in the endometrium when it reaches the uterus, which signals the beginning of pregnancy.\\r\\nThe ovaries are small, paired organs located near the lateral walls of the pelvic cavity. These organs are responsible for the production of the egg cells (ova) and the secretion of hormones. The process by which the egg cell (ovum) is released is called ovulation. The speed of ovulation is periodic and impacts directly to the length of a menstrual cycle.\\r\\nAfter ovulation, the egg cell is captured by the Fallopian tube, after traveling down the Fallopian tube to the uterus, occasionally being fertilized on its way by an incoming sperm. During fertilization the egg cell plays a role; it releases certain molecules that are essential to guiding the sperm and allows the surface of the egg to attach to the sperm's surface. The egg can then absorb the sperm and fertilization can then begin.[citation needed] The Fallopian tubes are lined with small hairs (cilia) to help the egg cell travel.\\r\\nThe reproductive tract (or genital tract) is the lumen that starts as a single pathway through the vagina, splitting up into two lumens in the uterus, both of which continue through the Fallopian tubes, and ending at the distal ostia that open into the abdominal cavity.\\r\\nIn the absence of fertilization, the ovum will eventually traverse the entire reproductive tract from the fallopian tube until exiting the vagina through menstruation.\\r\\nThe reproductive tract can be used for various transluminal procedures such as fertiloscopy, intrauterine insemination, and transluminal sterilization.\\r\\nChromosome characteristics determine the genetic sex of a fetus at conception. This is specifically based on the 23rd pair of chromosomes that is inherited. Since the mother's egg contains an X chromosome and the father's sperm contains either an X or Y chromosome, it is the male who determines the fetus's sex. If the fetus inherits the X chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a female. In this case, testosterone is not made and the Wolffian duct will degrade thus, the Mllerian duct will develop into female sex organs. The clitoris is the remnants of the Wolffian duct. On the other hand, if the fetus inherits the Y chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a male. The presence of testosterone will stimulate the Wolffian duct which will bring about the development of the male sex organs and the Mllerian duct will degrade.[2]\\r\\nVaginitis is inflammation of the vagina and largely caused by an infection. It is the most common gynaecological condition presented. It is difficult to determine any one organism most responsible for vaginitis because it varies from range of age, sexual activity, and method of microbial identification. Vaginitis is not necessarily caused by a sexually transmitted infection as there are many infectious agents that make use of the close proximity to mucous membranes and secretions. Vaginitis is usually diagnosed based on the presence of vaginal discharge, which can have a certain color, odor, or quality.[3]\\r\\nThis is a vaginal infection in women. It is differs from vaginitis in that there is no inflammation. Bacterial vaginosis is polymicrobial, consisting of many bacteria species. The diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis is made if three of the following four criteria are present: (1) Homogenous, thin discharge, (2) a pH of 4.5 in the vagina, (3) epithelial cells in the vagina with bacteria attached to them, or (4) a fishy odor. It has been associated with an increased risk of other genital tract infections such as endometritis.[3]\\r\\nThis is a common cause of vaginal irritation and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at least 75% of adult women have experienced one at least once in their lifetime. Yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of fungus in the vagina known as Candida. Yeast infections are usually caused by an imbalance of the pH in the vagina, which is usually acidic. Other factors such as pregnancy, diabetes, weakened immune systems, tight fitting clothing, or douching can also be a cause. Symptoms of yeast infections include itching, burning, irritation, and a white cottage-cheese-like discharge from the vagina. Women have also reported that they experience painful intercourse and urination as well. Taking a sample of the vaginal secretions and placing them under a microscope for evidence of yeast can diagnose a yeast infection. Treatment varies from creams that can be applied in or around the vaginal area to oral tablets that stop the growth of fungus.[3]\\r\\nThere are many practices of mutilating female genitalia in different cultures. The most common two types of genital mutilation practiced are clitoridectomy, the circumcision of the clitoris and the excision of the prepuce the skin around the clitoris. They can all involve a range of adverse health consequences such as bleeding, irreparable tissue damage, and sepsis which can sometimes prove fatal.\\r\\nGenitoplasty refers to surgery that is carried out to repair damaged sex organs particularly following cancer and its treatment. There are also elective surgical procedures which change the appearance of the external genitals.\\r\\nThe International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics was founded in 1954 to promote the well-being of women particularly in raising the standards of gynaecological practice and care. As of 2010 there were 124 countries involved.\\r\\nReproductive rights are legal rights related to reproduction and reproductive health. Women have the right to control matters involving their sexuality including their sexual and reproductive health. Violation of these rights include forced pregnancy, forced sterilization, forced abortion and genital mutilation. Female genital mutilation is the complete or partial removal of a female's external genitals.\\r\\nIt is claimed in the Hippocratic writings that both males and females contribute their seed to conception; otherwise, children would not resemble either or both of their parents. Four-hundred years later, Galen \\"identified\\" the source of 'female semen' as the ovaries in female reproductive organs.[4]","input":"What are the primary organs of the female reproductive system?"},{"output":"175 feet (53.34 m) wide","context":"AT&T Stadium, formerly Cowboys Stadium, is a retractable roof stadium in Arlington, Texas, United States. It serves as the home of the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL) and was completed on May 27, 2009. It is also the home of the Cotton Bowl Classic. The facility, owned by the city of Arlington, can also be used for a variety of other activities such as concerts, basketball games, college and high school football contests, soccer matches, and motocross and Spartan races. It replaced the partially covered Texas Stadium, which served as the Cowboys' home from 1971 through the 2008 season.\\r\\nThe stadium is sometimes referred to as \\"Jerry World\\" after Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who originally envisioned it as a large entertainment mecca.[16] The stadium seats 80,000,[5] making it tied as the fifth largest stadium in the NFL by seating capacity with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The maximum capacity of the stadium with standing room is 105,000.[17] The record attendance for an NFL game was set in 2009 with a crowd of 105,121.[18] The Party Pass (open areas) sections are behind seats in each end zone and on a series of six elevated platforms connected by stairways.[17][19] It also has the world's 24th largest high definition video screen, which hangs from 20-yard line to 20-yard line.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally estimated to cost $650 million, the stadium's current construction cost was $1.15 billion,[21] making it one of the most expensive sports venues ever built. To aid Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones in paying the construction costs of the new stadium, Arlington voters approved the increase of the city's sales tax by 0.5%, the hotel occupancy tax by 2%, and car rental tax by 5%. The City of Arlington provided over $325 million (including interest) in bonds as funding,[21][22] and Jones covered any cost overruns. Also, the NFL provided the Cowboys with an additional $150 million loan, following its policy for facilitating financing for the construction of new stadiums.[23]\\r\\nA pair of nearly 300?ft (91?m)-tall arches spans the length of the stadium dome, anchored to the ground at each end. The new stadium also includes \\"more than 3,000 Sony LCD displays throughout the luxury suites, concourses, concession areas and more, offering fans viewing options that extend beyond the action on the field\\".[24] It also houses a center-hung Mitsubishi video display board that was the largest high-definition television screen in the world at the time of their installation.[25] It has since been surpassed in size by the Panasonic \\"Big Hoss\\" video board (218 feet (66 m) wide and 94.6 feet (28.8 m) tall) at Texas Motor Speedway.[26] Glass doors, allowing each end zone to be opened, were designed and constructed by Dallas-based Haley-Greer glass systems.\\r\\nThe retractable roof was designed by structural engineering firm Walter P Moore and the systems were implemented by mechanization consultants Uni-Systems. The electrification of Cowboys Stadium's retractable roof was developed by VAHLE, Inc.[27] These Kinetic Architecture fundamentals will be employed in order to create quick conversions of the facility to accommodate a variety of events. When the design was officially unveiled on December?12, 2006, it showed that, from inside the stadium, the roof (membrane installed by K?Post Company of Dallas)[28] will look very similar to the Texas Stadium roof, with its trademark hole. However, it can be covered by the retractable roof panel to protect against the elements.\\r\\nThe football turf field was built by Hellas Construction. They developed a special SoftTop Convertible Turf System that has 26 interchangable panels to allow the stadium to host a variety of events from concerts, dirt bike and monster truck rallys to college football, basketball, and soccer games.[29]\\r\\nA Dallas Cowboys Hall of Fame is planned for the Hall of Fame level. The drawings also include a site for a large sculpture northeast of the stadium, close to Randol Mill Road.\\r\\nMayor Robert Cluck claimed to use eminent domain as a last resort but most of the properties refused to sell to the city, indicating that the incentive program was not adequate according to Glenn Sodd, an attorney representing some home owners in the area. Attorney Bob Cohen, who is representing some of the property owners, said the city gave many of his clients little incentive to sell. He said he represents the owners of some rental properties who were counting on that monthly revenue for their retirement and said most homeowners cannot afford to re-build or buy in that area with the incentive package.[30]\\r\\nIt is claimed that the stadium uses more electricity than the whole of Liberia.[31]\\r\\nAlthough the stadium had yet to sell naming rights, many fans started referring to the project with various nicknames such as JerryWorld,[38][46][47][48] the \\"Death Star\\",[49] \\"The Palace in Dallas\\" (for which announcer Bob Costas was criticized by the Arlington mayor[50]), \\"Cowboys Cathedral\\",[51] \\"Jerrassic Park\\" and others.[52] There was also a petition by some fans to have the stadium named after longtime Cowboys' coach Tom Landry.\\r\\nOn May 13, 2009, Jerry Jones announced the official name as Cowboys Stadium.[38]\\r\\nOn July 25, 2013, Jerry Jones announced that the Dallas Cowboys had agreed to grant naming rights to AT&T. The name change from Cowboys Stadium to AT&T Stadium took effect immediately.[53] The sponsorship deal was reported to be worth about $17ÿ19 million per year.[54] Facility Solutions Group installed the \\"AT&T Stadium\\" letters on the top of the stadium. Signage includes two sets of letters 43 feet (13?m) tall stretching 385 feet (117?m). The letters are made of lightweight components and aluminum and are insulated and heated to melt ice and snow.[55]\\r\\nThis is AT&T's fourth major sports venue where it holds the naming rights. The others are AT&T Park in San Francisco, AT&T Center in San Antonio, and Jones AT&T Stadium in Lubbock.\\r\\nAT&T Stadium is known as \\"The Death Star\\" by DFW sports fans.\\r\\nGuinness World Records was on hand at the September 28, 2009 game against the Carolina Panthers to award certificates to the Chairman of Mitsubishi Electric and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for the World's Largest High-Definition Video Display.[25] For basketball events played in Cowboys Stadium, such as the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, the video board is actually larger than the court. It has since been surpassed in size by the video boards at EverBank Field.\\r\\nDuring the debut preseason game of Cowboys Stadium on August 21, 2009, a punt by Tennessee Titans punter A. J. Trapasso hit the 175 feet (53.34 m) wide screen above the field. The punt deflected backwards and was ruled in-play until Titans coach Jeff Fisher informed the officials that the punt struck the scoreboard. By rule, the down was replayed. Jerry Jones believes that Trapasso was trying to hit the scoreboard, saying, \\"If you look at how you punt the football, unless you're trying to hit the scoreboard, you punt the ball to get downfield. You certainly want to get some hangtime, but you punt the ball to get downfield, and you sure don't punt the ball down the middle. You punt it off to the side.\\"[56] Whether the screen would affect an opposing team's punting strategy has been debated. For teams with strategies centered on maximizing hang-time, physicist Christopher Moore of Longwood University has shown via computer simulation that well-kicked punts have the potential to hit the screen no matter the field position.[57] Trapasso disputed Jones' suggestion that he was intentionally trying to hit the board, and other NFL punters have suggested that the board may pose a problem for longer hang-time punts. The screen was retrofitted with 16 custom winches using 11,000 feet (3.35 km) of 1.5 inches (3.8?cm) domestic galvanized wire rope from Tway Lifting Products to accomplish the safe, efficient transport of the video board in time to make room for U2's massive set during their 360 Tour, and was moved back down after the concert.[citation needed] The video board is also the primary attachment point for up to 370,000 lb (168 metric tons) of concert and theatrical rigging.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn August 24, 2013, Cowboys punter Chris Jones became the second player to hit the scoreboard. He conceded a touchdown on the re-kick.[58]\\r\\nOn February 14, 2010, the stadium hosted the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. With an announced crowd of 108,713, the game became the highest-attended basketball game in history, setting a new Guinness World Record. The East squad prevailed with a 141ÿ139 victory over the West.[59]\\r\\nAT&T Stadium, then known as Cowboys Stadium, was the site of the 2009 and 2010 Big 12 Championship Games, the last two held prior to the 2010ÿ13 Big 12 Conference realignment. On December 5, 2009, the Texas Longhorns defeated the Nebraska Cornhuskers 13ÿ12 in the 2009 Big 12 Championship Game, the first to be held in the stadium with attendance announced at 76,211.[65] The following year, on December 4, 2010, the Oklahoma Sooners and Nebraska Cornhuskers rekindled their rivalry as the Sooners won 23ÿ20 in the final Big 12 Championship game to date and will return starting with the 2017 season. The stadium was scheduled to host the games through the 2013 season, but the realignment of the Big 12 Conference to 10 teams meant they were not allowed to host a championship game because of NCAA rules requiring conferences to have at least 12 teams divided into two divisions in order to stage a championship game.[66][67]\\r\\nThe Arkansas Razorbacks vs. Texas A&M Aggies football rivalry, which began in 1903, was renewed in 2009 as the Southwest Classic, and was played at Cowboys Stadium from 2009 through 2011. In 2012, Texas A&M joined Arkansas in the Southeastern Conference, and the series reverted to the schools' home fields, Kyle Field in College Station, Texas for the 2012 game and Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville, Arkansas in 2013. The Southwest Classic returned to AT&T Stadium in 2014 and will remain there through at least 2020.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Big 12 Conference game between the Baylor Bears and Texas Tech Red Raiders was held at Cowboys Stadium, the first time in the series the match-up was held on a neutral site. The game was the highest attended in the series' history, with 71,964 in attendance.[73]\\r\\nAfter the 2010 game was held at the Cotton Bowl in Fair Park, Dallas during the State Fair of Texas, the series returned to AT&T Stadium for the 2011 and 2012 games. The series' neutral site contract at AT&T Stadium could continue until 2014.[74]\\r\\nAT&T Stadium has hosted a round of the AMA Supercross Championship since 2010, replacing Texas Stadium which had been host since 1975.[80]\\r\\nOn October 20, 2008, Cowboys owner Jones and New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner announced a joint business venture called Legends Hospitality Management LLC which would operate the concessions and merchandising sales at the new Cowboys stadium in Arlington, Texas, and at the new Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, New York, along with the stadiums of the Yankees' minor league affiliates. Former Pizza Hut President Michael Rawlings will run the company from its new headquarters in Newark, New Jersey. The company was also backed by Wall Street investment firm Goldman Sachs and Dallas private equity firm CIC Partners LP.[90][91][92]\\r\\nThe Jones family commissioned 18 contemporary artists to create site-specific artworks for the stadium.

The term is usually associated with astronomy, with reference to views of celestial bodies such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. The aurora borealis and aurora australis light up the skies of the Arctic and Antarctic circles respectively. Occasionally, a large coronal mass ejection from the Sun or simply high levels of solar wind extend the phenomenon toward the equator.[1]\\r\\nThe night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, farmers have used the state of the night sky as a calendar to determine when to plant crops. Many cultures have drawn constellations between stars in the sky, using them in association with legends and mythology about their deities.\\r\\nThe anciently developed belief of astrology is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The scientific study of the night sky and bodies observed within it, meanwhile, takes place in the science of astronomy.\\r\\nThe visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient lighting. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Special filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for the best seeing both professional and amateur optical astronomers seek viewing sites located far from major urban areas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that the sky is not completely dark at night, even in the absence of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the sky were absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.\\r\\nThe intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day and the primary cause differs as well. During daytime when the sun is above the horizon direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. In twilight, the period of time between sunset and sunrise, the situation is more complicated and a further differentiation is required. Twilight is divided in three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon in segments of 6.\\r\\nAfter sunset the civil twilight sets in, and ends when the sun drops more than 6 below the horizon. This is followed by the nautical twilight, when the sun reaches heights of -6 and -12, after which comes the astronomical twilight defined as the period from -12 to -18. When the sun drops more than 18 below the horizon the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.\\r\\nSeveral sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely airglow, indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial light pollution.\\r\\nDepending on local sky cloud cover, pollution, humidity, and light pollution levels, the stars visible to the unaided naked eye appear as hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of white pinpoints of light in an otherwise near black sky together with some feint nebulae or clouds of light .[5] In ancient times the stars were often assumed to be equidistant on a dome above the earth because they are much too far away for stereopsis to offer any depth cues. Visible stars range in color from blue (hot) to red (cold), but with such small points of feint light, most look white because they stimulate the rod cells without triggering the cone cells. If it is particularly dark and a particularly faint celestial object is of interest, averted vision may be helpful.\\r\\nThe stars of the night sky cannot be counted unaided because they are so numerous and there is no way to track which have been counted and which have not. Further complicating the count, fainter stars may appear and disappear depending on exactly where the observer is looking. The result is an impression of an extraordinarily vast star field.\\r\\nBecause stargazing is best done from a dark place away from city lights, dark adaptation is important to achieve and maintain. It takes several minutes for eyes to adjust to the darkness necessary for seeing the most stars, and surroundings on the ground are hard to discern. A red flashlight (torch) can be used to illuminate star charts, telescope parts, and the like without undoing the dark adaptation. (See Purkinje effect).\\r\\nThere are no markings on the night sky, though there exist many sky maps to aid stargazers in identifying constellations and other celestial objects. Constellations are prominent because their stars tend to be brighter than other nearby stars in the sky. Different cultures have created different groupings of constellations based on differing interpretations of the more-or-less random patterns of dots in the sky. Constellations were identified without regard to distance to each star, but instead as if they were all dots on a dome.\\r\\nOrion is among the most prominent and recognizable constellations.[6] The Big Dipper (which has a wide variety of other names) is helpful for navigation in the northern hemisphere because it points to Polaris, the north star.\\r\\nThe pole stars are special because they are approximately in line with the Earth's axis of rotation so they appear to stay in one place while the other stars rotate around them through the course of a night (or a year).\\r\\nPlanets, named for the Greek word for \\"wanderer,\\" process through the star field a little each day, executing loops with time scales dependent on the length of the planets year or orbital period around solar system. Planets, to the naked eye, appear as points of light in the sky with variable brightness. Planets shine due to sunlight reflecting or scattering from the planets surface or atmosphere. Thus the relative sun planet earth positions determine the planets brightness. With telescope or good binoculars the planets appear as discs demonstrating finite size and also show phases like Earth's moon and also may possess their own orbiting moons which occasionally cast shadow onto the host planet surface . Venus is the most prominent planet, often called the \\"morning star\\" or \\"evening star\\" because it is brighter than the stars and often the only \\"star\\" visible near sunrise or sunset depending on its location in its orbit. Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are also visible to the naked eye.\\r\\nEarth's Moon is a gray disc in the sky with cratering visible to the naked eye. It spans, depending on its exact location, 29-33 arcminutes - which is about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length, and is readily identified. Over 28 days, the moon goes through a full cycle of lunar phases. People can generally identify phases within a few days by looking at the moon. Unlike stars and most planets, the light reflected from the moon is bright enough to be seen during the day. (Venus can sometimes be seen even after sunrise.)\\r\\nSome of the most spectacular moons come during the full moon phase near sunset or sunrise. The moon on the horizon benefits from the moon illusion which makes it appear larger. The light reflected from the moon traveling through the atmosphere also colors the moon orange and/or red.\\r\\nComets come to the night sky only rarely. Comets are illuminated by the sun, and their tails extend away from the sun. A comet with visible tail is quite unusual - a great comet appears about once a decade. They tend to be visible only shortly before sunrise or after sunset because those are the times they are close enough to the sun to show a tail.\\r\\nClouds obscure the view of other objects in the sky, though varying thicknesses of cloudcover have differing effects. A very thin cirrus cloud in front of the moon might produce a rainbow-colored ring around the moon. Stars and planets are too small or dim to take on this effect, and are instead only dimmed (often to the point of invisibility). Thicker cloudcover obscures celestial objects entirely, making the sky black or reflecting city lights back down. Clouds are often close enough to afford some depth perception, though they are hard to see without moonlight or light pollution.\\r\\nOn clear dark nights in unpolluted areas, when the moon is thin or below the horizon, a band of what looks like white dust, the Milky Way, can be seen.\\r\\nShortly after sunset and before sunrise, artificial satellites often look like starssimilar in brightness and sizebut move relatively quickly. Those that fly in low Earth orbit cross the sky in a couple of minutes. Some satellites, including space debris, appear to blink or have a periodic fluctuation in brightness because they are rotating.\\r\\nMeteors (commonly known as shooting stars) streak across the sky very infrequently. During a meteor shower, they may average one a minute at irregular intervals, but otherwise their appearance is a random surprise. The occasional meteor will make a bright, fleeting streak across the sky, and they can be very bright in comparison to the night sky.\\r\\nAircraft are also visible at night, distinguishable at a distance from other objects because their lights blink.","input":"What is the first light in the night sky?"},{"output":"arapaima","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arapaima, pirarucu, or paiche are any large species of bonytongue in the genus Arapaima native to the Amazon and Essequibo basins of South America.  Genus Arapaima is the type genus of the family Arapaimidae.[1][2] They are among the world's largest freshwater fish, reaching as much as 3?m (9.8?ft).[1] They are an important food fish. They have declined in the native range due to overfishing and habitat loss[citation needed]. In contrast, arapaima have been introduced to several tropical regions outside the native range (within South America and elsewhere) where they are sometimes considered invasive species.[3] Its local name, pirarucu, derives from the indigenous words for \\"pira\\" meaning \\"fish\\" and \\"urucum\\" meaning \\"red\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nArapaima was traditionally regarded as a monotypic genus, but later several species were distinguished.[2][4][5] As a consequence of this taxonomic confusion, most earlier studies were done using the name A. gigas, but this species is only known from old museum specimens and the exact native range is unclear. The regularly seen and studied species is A. arapaima,[4][5][6]  although a small number of A. leptosoma also have been recorded in the aquarium trade.[7] The remaining species are virtually unknown: A. agassizii from old detailed drawings (the type specimen itself was lost during World War II bombings) and A. mapae from the type specimen.[2][4][5] A. arapaima is relatively thickset compared to the remaining species.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFishBase recognizes four species in the genus.[1] In addition to these, evidence suggests that a fifth species, A. arapaima, should be recognized (this being the widespread, well-known species, otherwise included in A. gigas).[4][5][6][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese fish are widely dispersed and do not migrate, which leads scientists to suppose that more species are waiting to be discovered among the depths of the Amazon Basin harbors. Sites such as these offer the likelihood of diversity.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nArapaima can reach lengths of more than 2?m (6?ft 7?in), in some exceptional cases even more than 2.5?m (8?ft 2?in) and over 100?kg (220?lb). The maximum recorded weight for the species is 200?kg (440?lb), while the longest recorded length was 4.52?m (15?ft). As a result of overfishing, large arapaima of more than 2?m (6?ft 7?in) are seldom found in the wild.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arapaima is torpedo-shaped with large blackish-green scales and red markings. It is streamlined and sleek, with its dorsal and anal fin set near its tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nArapaima scales have a mineralised, hard, outer layer with a corrugated surface under which lie several layers of collagen fibres in a Bouligand-type arrangement.[11][12] In a structure similar to plywood, the fibres in each successive layer are oriented at large angles to those in the previous layer, increasing toughness. The hard, corrugated surface of the outer layer, and the tough internal collagen layers work synergistically to contribute to their ability to flex and deform while providing strength and protectiona solution that allows the fish to remain mobile while heavily armored.[13] The arapaima has a fundamental dependence on surface air to breathe. In addition to gills, it has a modified and enlarged swim bladder, composed of lung-like tissue, which enables it to extract oxygen from the air.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diet of the arapaima consists of fish, crustaceans and small land animals that walk near the shore.[citation needed] The fish is an air-breather, using its labyrinth organ, which is rich in blood vessels and opens into the fish's mouth,[15] an advantage in oxygen-deprived water that is often found in the Amazon River. This fish is able to survive in oxbow lakes with dissolved oxygen as low as 0.5 ppm. In the wetlands of the Araguaia, one of the most important refuges for this species, it is the top predator in such lakes during the low water season, when the lakes are isolated from the rivers and oxygen levels drop, rendering its prey lethargic and vulnerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nArapaimas may leap out of the water if they feel constrained by their environment or harassed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to its geographic ranges, arapaima's life cycle is greatly affected by seasonal flooding. Various pictures show slightly different coloring owing to colour changes when they reproduce.[16] The arapaima lays its eggs during the months when water levels are low or beginning to rise. They build a nest about 50 centimetres (20?in) wide and 15 centimetres (5.9?in) deep, usually in muddy-bottomed areas. As the water rises, the eggs hatch and the offspring have the flood season during May to August to prosper such that yearly spawning is regulated seasonally.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arapaima male is a mouthbrooder, like his relative, the Osteoglossum, meaning the young are protected in his mouth until they are older. The female arapaima helps to protect the male and the young by circling them and fending off potential predators.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his book Three Singles to Adventure, naturalist Gerald Durrell reported that in British Guiana, female arapaima had been seen secreting a white substance from a gland in the head and that their young were seemingly feeding on the substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nFossils of arapaima or a very similar species have been found in the Miocene Villavieja Formation of Colombia[17] Museum specimens are found in France, England, United States, Brazil, Guyana, Ecuador and Per~.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nArapaima is used in many ways by local human populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is considered an aquarium fish, one that requires substantial space and food.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts tongue is thought to have medicinal qualities in South America. It is dried and combined with guarana bark, which is grated and mixed into water. Doses are given to kill intestinal worms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bony tongue is used to scrape cylinders of dried guarana, an ingredient in some beverages, and the bony scales are used as nail files.\\r\\n\\r\\nArapaima produces boneless steaks and is considered a delicacy. In the Amazon region locals often salt and dry the meat, rolling it into a cigar-style package that is then tied and can be stored without rotting, which is important in a region with little refrigeration. Arapaimas are referred to as the \\"cod of the Amazon\\", and can be prepared in the same way as traditional salted cod.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2009, villagers around Kenyir Lake in Terengganu, Malaysia, reported sighting A. gigas. The \\"Kenyir monster\\", or \\"dragon fish\\" as the locals call it, was claimed to be responsible for the mysterious drowning of two men on 17?June.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nFishing is allowed only in certain remote areas of the Amazon basin, and must either be catch-and-release or subsistence harvesting by native peoples.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome 7000 tons per year were taken from 1918 to 1924, the height of its commercial fishing. Demand led to farming of the fish by the ribeirinhos (people living on riverbanks).[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are harpooned or caught in large nets. Since the arapaima needs to surface to breathe air, traditional arapaima fishermen harpoon them and then club them to death. An individual fish can yield as much as 70 kilograms (150?lb) of meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arapaima was introduced for fishing in Thailand and Malaysia. Fishing in Thailand can be done in several lakes, where specimens over 150 kilograms (330?lb) are often landed and then released.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith catch-and-release after the fish is landed, it must be held for five minutes until it takes a breath. The fish has a large blood vessel running down its spine and lifting the fish clear of the water for trophy shots can rupture this vessel, causing death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 Whole Foods began selling farm-raised arapaima in the United States as a cheaper alternative to halibut or Chilean sea bass.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Thailand there is only one legal breeding farm located in Tambon Phrong Maduea, Amphoe Mueang Nakhon Pathom, Nakhon Pathom Province. This has been approved by both the Department of Fisheries and CITES since early 2018, and has been exported to worldwide as an aquarium fish.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe status of the arapaima population in the Amazon River Basin is unknown, hence it is listed on the IUCN red list as Data Deficient. It is difficult to conduct a population census in so large an area, and it is problematic to monitor catches in a trade that is largely illegal. Commercial arapaima fishing is banned by the Brazilian government due to its commercial extinction.[citation needed] Colombia bans the fishing and consumption of the arapaima between October 1 and March 15 as it's within the seasons that the fish breeds.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2014 study found that the fish was depleted or overexploited at 93% of the sites examined and well-managed or unfished in only 7%; the fish appeared to be extirpated in 19% of these sites.[24][25] Arapaima are particularly vulnerable to overfishing because of their size and because they must surface periodically to breathe.\\r\\n\\r\\nArapaima at the Shedd Aquarium\\r\\n\\r\\nArapaima at the Manila Ocean Park\\r\\n\\r\\nArapaima at the Cologne Zoological Garden\\r\\n\\r\\nArapaima leptosoma at the zoo (sea aquarium) in Sevastopol\\r\\n\\r\\nArapaima depicted on a 1954 postage stamp of British Guiana","input":"What is the largest fish in the amazon?"},{"output":"Greek physician","context":"Luke the Evangelist (Latin: Lcs, Ancient Greek: ??, Louk?s, Hebrew: ??????, Lqs, Aramaic: ???????, Lq) is one of the Four Evangeliststhe four traditionally ascribed authors of the canonical Gospels. The early church fathers ascribed to him authorship of both the Gospel according to Luke and the book of Acts of the Apostles, which would mean Luke contributed over a quarter of the text of the New Testament, more than any other author. Prominent figures in early Christianity such as Jerome and Eusebius later reaffirmed his authorship, although the fragile evidence[citation needed] of the identity of the author of the works has led to discussion in scholarly circles, both secular and religious.\\r\\nThe New Testament mentions Luke briefly a few times, and the Pauline epistle to the Colossians refers to him as a physician (from Greek for 'one who heals'); thus he is thought to have been both a physician and a disciple of Paul. Christians since the faith's early years have regarded him as a saint. He is believed to have been a martyr, reportedly as having been hanged from an olive tree, though some believe otherwise.\\r\\nThe Roman Catholic Church and other major denominations venerate him as Saint Luke the Evangelist and as a patron saint of artists, physicians, bachelors, surgeons, students and butchers; his feast day takes place on 18 October.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany scholars believe that Luke was a Greek physician who lived in the Greek city of Antioch in Ancient Syria, although some other scholars and theologians think Luke was a Hellenic Jew.[2][3] Bart Koet stated that it was widely accepted that the theology of LukeÿActs points to a gentile Christian writing for a gentile audience. Although he concludes that it is more plausible that Luke-Acts is directed to a community made up of both Jewish and gentile Christians, because there is stress on the scriptural roots of the gentile mission (see the use of Isaiah 49,6 in Luke-Acts).[4] [5] Gregory Sterling claims that he was either a Hellenistic Jew or a god-fearer.[3]\\r\\nHis earliest notice is in Paul's Epistle to PhilemonPhilemon 1:24. He is also mentioned in Colossians 4:14 and 2Timothy 4:11, two works commonly ascribed to Paul.[6][7][8][9][10] The next earliest account of Luke is in the Anti-Marcionite Prologue to the Gospel of Luke, a document once thought to date to the 2nd century, but which has more recently been dated to the later 4th century.[citation needed] Helmut Koester, however, claims that the following part, the only part preserved in the original Greek, may have been composed in the late 2nd century:\\r\\nLuke, was born in Antioch, by profession, was a physician.[11] He had become a disciple of the apostle Paul and later followed Paul until his [Paul's] martyrdom. Having served the Lord continuously, unmarried and without children, filled with the Holy Spirit he died at the age of 84 years. (p.?335)\\r\\nEpiphanius states that Luke was one of the Seventy Apostles (Panarion 51.11), and John Chrysostom indicates at one point that the \\"brother\\" Paul mentions in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians 8:18 is either Luke or Barnabas.[citation needed]\\r\\nIf one accepts that Luke was in fact the author of the Gospel bearing his name and also the Acts of the Apostles, certain details of his personal life can be reasonably assumed. While he does exclude himself from those who were eyewitnesses to Jesus' ministry, he repeatedly uses the word \\"we\\" in describing the Pauline missions in Acts of the Apostles, indicating that he was personally there at those times.[12]\\r\\nThere is similar evidence that Luke resided in Troas, the province which included the ruins of ancient Troy, in that he writes in Acts in the third person about Paul and his travels until they get to Troas, where he switches to the first person plural. The \\"we\\" section of Acts continues until the group leaves Philippi, when his writing goes back to the third person. This change happens again when the group returns to Philippi. There are three \\"we sections\\" in Acts, all following this rule. Luke never stated, however, that he lived in Troas, and this is the only evidence that he did.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe composition of the writings, as well as the range of vocabulary used, indicate that the author was an educated man. A quote in the Epistle to the Colossians differentiates between Luke and other colleagues \\"of the circumcision.\\"\\r\\n10 My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. 11 Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me. ... 14 Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings. Colossians 4:10ÿ11, 14.\\r\\nThis comment has traditionally caused commentators to conclude that Luke was a gentile. If this were true, it would make Luke the only writer of the New Testament who can clearly be identified as not being Jewish. However, that is not the only possibility. Although Luke is considered likely to be a gentile Christian, some scholars believe him to be a Hellenized Jew.[2][3][13] The phrase could just as easily be used to differentiate between those Christians who strictly observed the rituals of Judaism and those who did not.[12]\\r\\nLuke's presence in Rome with the Apostle Paul near the end of Paul's life was attested by 2 Timothy 4:11: \\"Only Luke is with me\\". In the last chapter of the Book of Acts, widely attributed to Luke, we find several accounts in the first person also affirming Luke's presence in Rome including Acts 28:16: \\"And when we came to Rome...\\" According to some accounts,[who?] Luke also contributed to the authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews.[14]\\r\\nLuke died at age 84 in Boeotia, according to a \\"fairly early and widespread tradition\\".[15] According to Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos (Ecclesiastical History 14th century AD., Migne P.G. 145, 876) and others, Luke's tomb was located in Thebes, whence his relics were transferred to Constantinople in the year 357.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Gospel of Luke does not name its author.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] The Gospel was not written and does not claim to be written by direct witnesses to the reported events, unlike Acts beginning in the sixteenth chapter.[18][25][26]\\r\\nThe earliest manuscript of the Gospel, dated circa AD?200, ascribes the work to Luke; as did Irenaeus, writing circa AD?180, and the Muratorian fragment from AD?170.[27]\\r\\nThe gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles make up a two-volume work which scholars call LukeÿActs. Together they account for 27.5% of the New Testament, the largest contribution by a single author.[28]\\r\\nMost scholars understand Luke's works (LukeÿActs) in the tradition of Greek historiography.[29] The preface of The Gospel of Luke[30] drawing on historical investigation identified the work to the readers as belonging to the genre of history.[31] There is some disagreement about how best to treat Luke's writings, with some historians regarding Luke as highly accurate, and others taking a more critical approach.\\r\\nBased on his accurate description of towns, cities and islands, as well as correctly naming various official titles, archaeologist Sir William Ramsay wrote that \\"Luke is a historian of the first rank; not merely are his statements of fact trustworthy... [he] should be placed along with the very greatest of historians.\\"[32] Professor of Classics at Auckland University, E.M. Blaiklock, wrote: \\"For accuracy of detail, and for evocation of atmosphere, Luke stands, in fact, with Thucydides. The Acts of the Apostles is not shoddy product of pious imagining, but a trustworthy record... it was the spadework of archaeology which first revealed the truth.\\"[33] New Testament scholar Colin Hemer has made a number of advancements in understanding the historical nature and accuracy of Luke's writings.[34]\\r\\nOn the purpose of Acts, New Testament Scholar Luke Timothy Johnson has noted that \\"Luke's account is selected and shaped to suit his apologetic interests, not in defiance of but in conformity to ancient standards of historiography.\\"[35] Such a position is shared by most commentators such as Richard Heard who sees historical deficiencies as arising from \\"special objects in writing and to the limitations of his sources of information.\\"[36]\\r\\nDuring modern times, Luke's competence as a historian is questioned, depending upon one's a priori view of the supernatural.[37] Since post-Enlightenment historians work with methodological naturalism,[38][39] such historians would see a narrative that relates supernatural, fantastic things like angels, demons etc., as problematic as a historical source. Mark Powell claims that \\"it is doubtful whether the writing of history was ever Luke's intent. Luke wrote to proclaim, to persuade, and to interpret; he did not write to preserve records for posterity. An awareness of this, has been, for many, the final nail in Luke the historians coffin.\\"[37]\\r\\nRobert M. Grant has noted that although Luke saw himself within the historical tradition, his work contains a number of statistical improbabilities such as the sizable crowd addressed by Peter in Acts 4:4. He has also noted chronological difficulties whereby Luke \\"has Gamaliel refer to Theudas and Judas in the wrong order, and Theudas actually rebelled about a decade after Gamaliel spoke (5:36ÿ7)\\"[29]\\r\\nChristian tradition, starting from the 8th century, states that he was the first icon painter. He is said to have painted pictures of the Virgin Mary and Child, in particular the Hodegetria image in Constantinople (now lost). Starting from the 11th century a number of painted images were venerated as his autograph works, including for example, the Black Madonna of Cz?stochowa and Our Lady of Vladimir. He was also said to have painted Saints Peter and Paul, and to have illustrated a gospel book with a full cycle of miniatures.[40][41]\\r\\nLate medieval Guilds of St Luke in the cities of Late Medieval Europe, especially Flanders, or the \\"Accademia di San Luca\\" (Academy of Saint Luke) in Romeimitated in many other European cities during the 16th centurygathered together and protected painters. The tradition that Luke painted icons of Mary and Jesus has been common, particularly in Eastern Orthodoxy. The tradition also has support from the Saint Thomas Christians of India who claim to still have one of the Theotokos icons that Saint Luke painted and which St. Thomas brought to India.[42]\\r\\nIn traditional depictions, such as paintings, evangelist portraits and church mosaics, Saint Luke is often accompanied by an ox or bull, usually having wings. Sometimes only the symbol is shown, especially when in a combination of those of all Four Evangelists.[43][44]\\r\\nDespot George of Serbia bought the relics from the Ottoman sultan Murad II for 30,000 gold coins.[45][46][not in citation given] After the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia, the kingdom's last queen, George's granddaughter Mary, who had brought the relics with her from Serbia as her dowry, sold them to the Venetian Republic.[47]\\r\\nIn 1992, the then Greek Orthodox Metropolitan Ieronymos of Thebes and Levathia (the current Archbishop of Athens and All Greece) requested from Bishop Antonio Mattiazzo of Padua the return of \\"a significant fragment of the relics of St. Luke to be placed on the site where the holy tomb of the Evangelist is located and venerated today\\". This prompted a scientific investigation of the relics in Padua, and by numerous lines of empirical evidence (archeological analyses of the Tomb in Thebes and the Reliquary of Padua, anatomical analyses of the remains, Carbon-14 dating, comparison with the purported skull of the Evangelist located in Prague) confirmed that these were the remains of an individual of Syrian descent who died between 416 BC and AD 72.[48] The Bishop of Padua then delivered to Metropolitan Ieronymos the rib of Saint Luke that was closest to his heart to be kept at his tomb in Thebes, Greece.[45][46]\\r\\nThus, nowadays, the relics of Saint Luke are so divided:\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nSources","input":"What was luke before he became a disciple?"},{"output":"Radio","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio is the debut studio album by American rapper LL Cool J. It was on November 18, 1985, by Def Jam Recordings and was the record label's first full-length album release. Radio was recorded during 1984 to 1985 at Chung King House of Metal in New York City and produced primarily by Rick Rubin, who provided a sparse and minimal production style. The album also features a sound punctuated by DJ scratching, often brief samples, and emphasis of the downbeat. LL Cool J's aggressive b-boy lyrics explored themes of inner city culture, teenage promiscuity, and braggadocio raps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album experienced a significant amount of commercial success and sales for a hip hop record at the time, earning U.S. Billboard chart success and selling over 500,000 copies within its first five months of release. On April 19, 1989, Radio was certified platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), following sales in excess of one million copies in the United States. Initial criticism of the album was generally positive, as LL Cool J's lyricism and Rick Rubin's production were praised by several music critics. It has since been recognized by critics as LL Cool J's greatest work.\\r\\n\\r\\nReflecting the new school and ghettoblaster subculture in the U.S. during the mid-1980s, Radio belongs to a pivotal moment in the history and culture of hip hop. Its success contributed to the displacement of the old school with the new school form and to the genre's mainstream success during the period. Its success also served as a career breakthrough for LL Cool J and Rick Rubin. Radio has been recognized by music writers as one of the first cohesive and commercially successful hip hop albums.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1984, when NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons founded the then-independent Def Jam label, 16?yearÿold St. Albans, Queens native James Todd Smith was creating demo tapes in his grandparents' home.[1] His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $?2,000 worth of stereo equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier.[2] Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that \\"By the time I got that equipment, I was already a rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It's like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish house. I got into it when I was about 9, and since then all I wanted was to make a record and hear it on the radio.\\"[2] By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City, including Simmons' and Rubin's own Def Jam Recordings.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder his new stage name, LL Cool J (an acronym for Ladies Love Cool James),[4] Smith was signed by Def Jam, which led to the release of his first official record, the 12-inch single \\"I Need a Beat\\" (1984).[1] The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes.[1] Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating \\"I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where I found my home.\\"[5] That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating \\"They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing.?...

A Queens native and former trombonist, Philpot met LL at a block party and they began performing together.[11] The audio mastering was handled by engineer Herb Powers at 130 West 42nd Street in the Frankford Wayne Mastering Labs and the album was set for release as Radio in November 1985, containing a dedication in the liner notes from LL Cool J to his mother and his grandparents.[12][unreliable source?][13] The album's release had been anticipated by many rap fans following LL Cool J's appearance in the hip hop movie Krush Groove, which was based on the beginnings of the Def Jam label and featured the single \\"I Can't Live Without My Radio\\" from Radio.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album's production, handled entirely by Rick Rubin with a remix by DJ Jazzy Jay, has been noted by critics and music writers for Rubin's minimalist style and stripped-down aggressiveness.[13][14] Steve Huey of AllMusic described the production for Radio as \\"bare-bones\\" and \\"skeletal\\", while calling the instrumentation \\"basically just a cranked-up beatbox.\\"[14] The sound of Radio is mostly punctuated by DJ scratching and features occasional brief samples, which emphasize a downbeat.[14] In summing up the musical style of Radio, Huey stated \\"The result is rap at its most skeletal, with a hard-hitting, street-level aggression that perfectly matches LL's cocksure teenage energy.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lyrical themes regarding the culture and the way of life of inner city youth that surface in Radio, including the growing and popular b-boy attitude (\\"I Can't Live Without My Radio\\", \\"Rock the Bells\\") and teenage promiscuity (\\"Dear Yvette\\"), along with LL's \\"teenage energy\\", as described by writer Nelson George, helped appeal to a younger music audience and were essential in the album's commercial success.[13] LL Cool J's lyricism on Radio is highlighted by clever disses, playful boasts and braggadocio raps.[14][15] Columnist Stephen Holden of The New York Times described LL Cool J as \\"a brawny young giant with the animal magnetism and amiable self-assurance of the young Muhammad Ali.\\"[2] \\"I Want You\\" and \\"I Can Give You More\\" have been recognized by listeners of hip hop as the first hip-hop ballads, and have been cited likewise by several music writers and critics.[13][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthor of the 1985 book Fresh: Hip Hop Don't Stop, writer Nelson George further elaborated on the appeal of Radio to listeners at the time, describing LL Cool J as a \\"minimalist homeboy who knows his beats\\", and stating \\"You can call it rap, hip hop or street, but it really is a way of hearing musicand partying hardthat expresses the experiences and attitudes of a great many inner city kids. L.L. Cool J is one of the best young talkologists around, because he speaks directly to and about his generation over large beats that recall Run-D.M.C., Trouble Funk, James Brown, and funky little bits of AC/DC and Yes ... This teenage music is built around beats, but not just any old beats. It is all about a beat with style, with personality, and L.L. Cool J has plenty of both.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nReleased November 18, 1985, on Def Jam Recordings in the United States,[24] Radio earned a significant amount of commercial success and sales for a hip hop record at the time. It sold over 500,000 copies in its first five months, eventually selling over 1 million copies by 1988, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.[13][25] Radio peaked at number 6 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and at number 46 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.[26] It entered the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart on December 28, 1985, and remained there for forty-seven weeks, while also entering the Pop Albums chart on January 11, 1986.[26] Radio remained on the chart for thirty-eight weeks.[26] By 1989, the album had earned platinum status from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), after earning a gold certification in the United States on April 14, 1986, with sales exceeding one million copies.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio received positive reviews from both \\"street and dance music\\" aficionados and mainstream music critics,[27] including Robert Christgau from The Village Voice, who described it in a January 1986 article as \\"the most engaging and original rap album of the year\\".[28] LL Cool J's aggressive rapping and Rick Rubin's stripped-down production were praised by critics who also agreed that LL's lyrics set a new standard for MC's at the time.[14] The songs' lyrics were favored by critics who described LL's songwriting as clever and fun.[15] Connie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times said that he is an integral artist of hip hop's \\"second generation\\" because of his \\"razor-sharp wit\\".[29] Rolling Stone magazine's Debby Bull was impressed by his songwriting and how its originality lies in the ballads, even though \\"it's the sassier, dance-worthy songs that make this record such an irresistible party.\\"[30] The critical success of the album would later result in its comparison to other LL Cool J albums, which were not as critically successful as Radio.[14][31] In his review for the Trouser Press, Ira Robbins called the album a \\"primary classic of hip-hop's original commercial surge\\" and went on to write:\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its initial reception, Radio has been viewed by fans and critics as LL Cool J's greatest work, as well as one of hip hop's best albums.[33] In retrospect, some critics and music writers have given more praise to producer Rick Rubin's contributions to Radio, as well as note the importance of his production on the album. Yahoo! Music's Frank Meyer said that the album was \\"one of the earliest records, along with Run-DMC, to combine the vocal approach of rap with the musical arrangements and riffing of rock 'n' roll. 'I Can't Live Without My Radio' is a hip-hop classic and this album set the standard for East Coast rap for a long time.\\"[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio was later ranked at number 2 on ego trip magazine's \\"Hip Hop's 25 Greatest Albums (1980-98)\\", number 69 on Rolling Stone's \\"100 Best LPs of the 80s\\", and number 71 on Blender's \\"100 Greatest American Albums of All Time\\" list.[35] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked the album number 478 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time;[36] it was ranked number 470 in a revised list in 2012.[37] The album was also included in Rolling Stone magazine's 1997 issue of \\"The Essential 200 Rock Records\\".[38] In 1998, Radio was selected as one of The Source magazine's \\"100 Best Rap Albums\\".[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the breakthrough success of his hit single \\"I Need a Beat\\" and the Radio LP, LL Cool J became one of the first hip-hop acts to achieve mainstream success along with Kurtis Blow and Run-D.M.C. Gigs at larger venues were offered to LL as he would join the 1986-'87 Raising Hell tour, opening for Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys.[40] Another milestone of LL's popularity was his appearance on American Bandstand as the first hip hop act on the show.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album's success also helped in contributing to Rick Rubin's credibility and repertoire as a record producer. Radio, along with Raising Hell (1986) and Licensed to Ill (1986), would form a trilogy of New York City-based, Rubin-helmed albums that helped to diversify hip-hop.[10][42] Rubin's production credit on the back cover reads \\"REDUCED BY RICK RUBIN\\", referring to his minimalist production style, which gave the album its stripped-down and gritty sound. This style would serve as one of Rubin's production trademarks and would have a great impact on future hip-hop productions.[43] Rubin's early hip hop production work, before his exit from Def Jam to Los Angeles, helped solidify his legacy as a hip hop pioneer and establish his reputation in the music industry.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio's release coincided with the growing new school scene and subculture, which also marked the beginning of hip-hop's \\"golden age\\" and the replacement of old school hip hop.[16][44] This period of hip hop was marked by the end of the disco rap stylings of old school, which had flourished prior to the mid-80s, and the rise of a new style featuring \\"ghetto blasters\\". Radio served as one of the earliest records, along with Run-D.M.C.'s debut album, to combine the vocal approach of hip hop and rapping with the musical arrangements and riffing sound of rock music, pioneering the rap rock hybrid sound.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emerging new school scene was initially characterized by drum machine-led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock, as well as boasts about rapping delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song, the artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the 1970s P-Funk and disco-influenced outfits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of acts prevalent in 1984, rendering them old school.[46] In contrast to the lengthy, jam-like form predominant throughout early hip hop (\\"King Tim III\\", \\"Rapper's Delight\\", \\"The Breaks\\"), new school artists tended to compose shorter songs that would be more accessible and had potential for radio play, and conceive more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts; the style typified by LL Cool J's Radio.[47] A leading example of the new school sound is the song \\"I Can't Live Without My Radio\\", a loud, defiant declaration of public loyalty to his boom box, which The New York Times described as \\"quintessential rap in its directness, immediacy and assertion of self\\".[2] It was featured in the film Krush Groove (1985), which was based on the rise of Def Jam and new school acts such as Run-D.M.C. and the Fat Boys.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe energy and hardcore delivery and musical style of rapping featured on Radio, as well as other new school recordings by artists such as Run-D.M.C., Schooly D, T La Rock and Steady B, proved to be influential to hip hop acts of the \\"golden age\\" such as Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy.[49] The decline of the old school form of hip hop also led to the closing of Sugar Hill Records, one of the labels that helped contribute to early hip-hop and that, coincidently, rejected LL's demo tape.[31] As the album served as an example of an expansion of hip hop music's artistic possibilities, its commercial success and distinct sound soon led to an increase in multi-racial audiences and listeners, adding to the legacy of the album and hip hop as well.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll tracks written by James Todd Smith and Rick Rubin, except where noted..\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone^shipments figures based on certification alone","input":"What is ll cool j's first album?"},{"output":"Last Vegas","context":"Last Vegas is a 2013 American comedy film directed by Jon Turteltaub, written by Dan Fogelman and starring Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Kline and Mary Steenburgen.[2] The plot surrounds three retirees who travel to Las Vegas to have a bachelor party for their last remaining single friend.\\r\\nThe film was released to theaters on November 1, 2013, by CBS Films.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBilly, Paddy, Archie and Sam are childhood friends from Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York, who are now living in their senior years. Sam and his wife Miriam are living mundane lives in Naples, Florida. Archie, twice-divorced and recovering from a minor stroke, lives with his overprotective son Ezra and his family in Englewood, New Jersey. Paddy lives alone in his Brooklyn apartment, a curmudgeon in grief since the death of his wife, Sophie, over a year ago. Billy is a successful entrepreneur in Malibu, California, who lives with his 31-year-old girlfriend Lisa. Shortly after proposing to Lisa, Billy finds an old bottle of scotch he and his friends stole in their childhood days and calls Sam and Archie, who immediately propose a bachelor party for Billy in Las Vegas before his wedding that weekend. After being given permission by Miriam to cheat on her, Sam collects Archie and Paddy and fly off to rendezvous with Billy in Vegas.\\r\\nArriving in Vegas, Billy and Paddy get into a heated argument about Billy's failure to attend Sophie's funeral. They head to Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel to check in, only to realize that the hotel is closed for renovations. They agree to try the Aria Resort and Casino, where the wedding will be held. Before leaving Binion's they are attracted to the lounge by the singing voice of Diana, who is immediately charmed by their appreciation of her singing. The five share a drink, and they convince Diana to join them at The Aria.\\r\\nWhile waiting to get rooms, Archie goes to a blackjack table and has a brief altercation with a cocky gambler named Dean. Archie buys chips with $15,000 (half of his pension funds), planning to enjoy his escape from medical worries. When Paddy and Sam return, they find that Archie is up to $102,000, and they quickly leave the table in fear of being accused of card counting. Meanwhile, as Billy tours the wedding chapel with Diana, he becomes charmed with her as she explains to him that she moved to Vegas because she was recently laid off as a tax attorney in Atlanta and always wanted to sing despite being a divorced empty nester.\\r\\nThe quartet later become judges of a wild swimsuit competition. They are then confronted by the casino manager, who offers the group his largest penthouse suite for free, in hopes that Archie will stay and spend his winnings at the hotel. They are assigned Lonnie (who is disappointed because the original person staying in the room was going to be 50 cent) is their host/butler. Billy suggests they open the old bottle of scotch to celebrate the gang's reunion, but Paddy confronts him about his absence from Sophies funeral and leaves the suite. That night, the remaining three go to the Aria's popular nightclub, where they accept the bouncer's suggestion that they earn immediate entrance by purchasing $1,800 bottle service, using some of Archie's winnings. There, Billy and Sam talk with the bachelorette and her maid-of-honor from a bachelorette party while Archie goes dancing. Dean comes by and begins groping the bachelorette and is confronted by Archie, Billy and Sam. Dean attempts to throw a punch at Billy but is knocked down by Paddy, who stopped by to give Archie his cell phone due to several missed calls from his son Ezra.\\r\\nThe next day, while the others are hungover and recovering, Paddy visits Diana and tells her that he and Billy were both in love with Sophie when they were younger and she picked Paddy. Diana catches his eye while she tries to convince him to stop grieving and move on with life because Sophie would want it. Afterwards, Paddy joins Billy at their pool cabana and admits he needs to move on from Sophies passing while also showing concern for Billy about marrying a younger woman. The others join in and decide to throw a big bachelor party in their suite that night. Lonnie brings Dean to the cabana to apologize for his behavior, having convinced him that the quartet are mafia members from the East Coast called The Flatbush Four. Dean, fearing for his life, agrees to become their errand boy for the day. With Lonnie and Dean's help, they prepare for the party and invite several people including the bachelorette group from the nightclub, exotic dancers, a band of transvestite entertainers, and cast members of Zarkana.\\r\\nWhile the others prepare his party, Billy visits Diana. She admits that she is fond of him, and asks if he truly loves Lisa. As they walk along The Strip, Billy tells Diana that Paddy gave Sophie an ultimatum to choose either Billy or him and she secretly chose Billy first, but Billy told Sophie that she was meant to be with Paddy.\\r\\nThe bachelor party goes into full force as Paddy gets ready to be social again, finally removing his wedding ring. Sam meets the maid of honor from the night before, who begins flirting with him to his delight. Archie dances with the bachelorette, strippers, transvestites, then gives advice to Dean on how he, too, can meet women properly. Archie is surprised by a worried Ezra, who tracked Archie's cell phone. Archie convinces him to calm down and enjoy this chance for some special father-son time. Sam and the maid of honor head upstairs to be alone, where he encourages and enjoys her seductive ways but eventually turns down sex, realizing that he tells Miriam about all the wonderful things that happen in his life, and telling her about this soon-to-be wonderful moment would devastate her.\\r\\nPaddy tells Billy he invited Diana to the party because he likes her and wants to start anew after Sophies passing, but realizes Billy likes her too. When Diana arrives, Billy pushes Paddy into the decorative pool in the suite and takes Diana upstairs to tell her that Paddy likes her and to give him a chance. She states that she feels like she is being treated like Sophie and gifted by Billy to Paddy, which Paddy overhears. Paddy is devastated to learn about Sophie's choice and throws the old bottle of scotch in the trash as he leaves the party.\\r\\nThe next morning, Paddy confronts Billy at the pool and tells him he does not love Lisa like Paddy loved Sophie and that the wedding must be stopped. As Lisa and her bridesmaids arrive, Paddy pushes Billy into the pool and tells Lisa that Billy is calling off the wedding. Billy and Lisa talk it out and Lisa leaves with her bridesmaids. As the guys pack up to leave, Billy comes to terms with his age and admits his fear of getting old and being alone. They come together as friends again and tell Billy to go see Diana. Billy shows up at the lounge where Diana is singing and reveals his feelings for her. The guys say their goodbyes to Dean and Lonnie and finally decide to crack open the old bottle of scotch for a final toast..\\r\\nA couple months later, Billy and Diana call Archie and Paddy to announce they are getting married. They try to call Sam but he is unable to answer the phone as he is busy in bed with Miriam.\\r\\nEarly in development, Jack Nicholson was attached to the project.[5]\\r\\nPrincipal photography started in November 2012 in Las Vegas.[6] At the end of November, filming moved to the Atlanta, Georgia, area.[7]\\r\\nLast Vegas has received mixed reviews from critics.

Each episode of the quiz features teams of two contestants attempting to find correct but obscure answers to general knowledge questions in order to score as few points as possible, and become eligible to compete for the show's cash jackpot. All questions used on the show are factual in nature, and are asked to a panel of 100 individuals in a pre-conducted public survey. Contestants seek to find correct answers that were given by as few participants as possible; those given by no participants are termed \\"pointless\\" and are the most desirable. Every pointless answer given during the main game increases the jackpot by S250, and one such answer must be given in the final round in order to win it.\\r\\nAlthough it originally debuted on BBC Two on 24 August 2009, its success in its first three series led the BBC to broadcasting it on BBC One from 2011, though on occasions when the channel is to feature live broadcasts of major news and sporting events, the programme is aired on BBC Two as a direct result. To date, the programme has aired 18 series,[1] and has had peak audience figures of over 7 million viewers.[2] The show has spawned a celebrity edition entitled Pointless Celebrities in 2011, which to date has had 10 series, with the format being exported to a number of European countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe object of the game is for contestants to provide answers that are not only correct but also as obscure as possible, with each game consisting of teams of two contestants; previously the programme featured five teams to begin with, but this was later reduced to four teams. Prior to each show, 100 people are given 100 seconds to provide as many answers as they can to a series of general knowledge questions as part of a pre-conducted survey, and in each round, contestants are asked these same questions. Giving a correct answer scores one point for every participant that gave it, though if none of the survey participants gives a correct answer that a contestant provides, the team scores zero points for providing a \\"Pointless\\" answer, while giving an incorrect answer scores 100 points. In all rounds, host Alexander Armstrong provides contestants with the rules they must adhere to, as well as the category and question they will be answering, while his assistant Richard Osman elaborates on what answers they will accept with the current question, provides information on any answers given (whether right or wrong), and showcases a list of all the Pointless answers a contestant has provided/could have used and the top three high-scoring answers for the question.[3]\\r\\nThe format of the show consists of two elimination rounds to begin with, in which teams must achieve as low a score as possible, with those who achieve the highest score in each round being eliminated from the game; if two teams are tied for the highest score in either of these rounds, a sudden-death \\"lockdown\\" round is played, with the higher-scoring team losing. Following these rounds, the two surviving teams compete against each other to find the lowest scoring answer in a series of questions, with the winning team moving on to the final round. Prior to the final round, every Pointless answer given adds S250 to the cash jackpot, and eliminated teams making their first appearance are eligible to appear again in the next consecutive game; teams who have appeared twice or reached the final round cannot return (with the exceptions of the teams that appeared in the 1000th episode). The team that reaches the final round is awarded a Pointless trophy to keep, and then must supply three answers to a question, in which one must be a Pointless answer in order to win the jackpot as it stands for that game, otherwise the money rolls over to the next show.\\r\\nThe cash jackpot begins at S1,000 at the start of its run. Should it not be won at the end of a game, the amount (including any increases from Pointless answers) is rolled over to the next game and increased by S1,000, offering returning and new contestants a chance of winning a bigger cash prize. To date, the highest recorded jackpot won on the show as a result of it rolling over from previous games, was S24,750 on 8 March 2013. Once the jackpot is won, the amount is reset to S1,000. For the celebrity version, the jackpot is set at S2,500, and increases by S250 for each Pointless answer found, while special editions have the jackpot set at S5,000, and increased by S500 for each Pointless answer found; in neither version does the jackpot roll over to another show.\\r\\nDuring an elimination round, teams aim to score as few points as possible, with the team having the highest score at the end of the round being eliminated from the game. Each round consists of a question derived from a subject, with each member of a team required to give an answer during a pass; each round consists of two passes, and teams are required, prior to the question being given, to decide who answers during the first pass, with the other answering during the second pass. The order of play differs; in the first elimination round, it is determined by drawing lots in advance of recording, while in the second, it is determined by the scores in the previous round, though in both, the team nearest to the host answers first, moving on towards the team farthest from them, before going back in reverse order during the second pass. In the event of a tie, the tied teams are allowed to confer and give an extra answer to the question, until one team manages to score more points than the others; if no team can give a correct answer on this pass, the question is thrown out and a new one is asked in its place.\\r\\nFive different formats for the questions are used/have been used during the programme's run for the elimination rounds in each game, and are listed below:\\r\\nThe two teams that survive elimination in the initial rounds, now compete against each other, answering questions with the intention of finding the lowest answers possible. Both teams can now confer, and the winning team of this round moves on to the Final. The format of this round has differed, as listed below:\\r\\nThe winning team that survives both the elimination rounds and the head-to-head receives a Pointless trophy that they are allowed to keep, regardless of what happens in the final round, and now attempt to win the game's jackpot; the host will usually remind viewers of the amount, including if it is a rollover from a previous game(s). In order to win it, the team first chose a category from a list given to them, whereupon they are given a question connected to it, and have 60 seconds to confer amongst themselves on which three answers they will use; contestants may freely end the debating period early, if they have decided on which three to give. If any individual response is a Pointless answer, the team wins the jackpot, otherwise it is rolled over to the next show.\\r\\nOriginally, contestants could choose from one of three categories, with those not chosen remaining in the list for five days or until they were picked. This format was used between the first and fifth series. The number of categories to choose from was then increased to five at the start of the sixth series. By the start of the second half of the ninth series, the format of the round was modified in that the winning team must supply answers within three subcategories connected to their chosen category, though they may elect to go for any or all three subcategories with their answers. In addition, they must state which subcategory each of their answer belongs to; if it is for the wrong one, their answer is considered incorrect.\\r\\nFollowing the success of Pointless and its transfer to BBC One, the BBC commissioned a celebrity edition of the programme, entitled Pointless Celebrities. Like the main show, the celebrity edition featured teams of two celebrities competing against each other to win the jackpot for their chosen charities. While the show used the same format for rounds, the celebrity edition featured notable differences. Unlike the regular show, the celebrity version was reserved for the weekend and placed in a prime-time evening slot for its broadcast. In addition, most episodes usually featured a theme in regards to the celebrity contestants that took part ÿ an example, a celebrity edition aired in December 2015 consisted of celebrities who were made famous on reality television shows like Big Brother and Made in Chelsea.[4]\\r\\nAs the celebrity edition is for charity, celebrity teams compete for a jackpot of S2,500, and can increase the amount by S250 for every Pointless answer they find before the final round. While the jackpot will not roll over to the next celebrity game if it is not won, the programme rewards all teams with S500 for taking part, regardless of how well they performed.\\r\\nThe show's format (originally to be called \\"Obviously\\") was conceived by Tom Blakeson, Simon Craig, David Flynn, Nick Mather, Richard Osman and Shaun Parry, producers at Endemol UK, in 2009. They envisaged it as a \\"reverse Family Fortunes....rewarding obscure knowledge, while allowing people to also give obvious answers....a quiz which could be sort of highbrow and populist simultaneously\\".[5] Osman was not originally intended to be co-presenter, primarily fulfilling the role only as part of a demonstration laid on for the BBC. However the BBC executives asked him to continue when they commissioned the first series.[5] Osman then approached comedian Alexander Armstrong, a peer of Osman's during their university days, to be the main presenter.[5] Armstrong, who the previous year had been lined up to present Channel 4's Countdown only to back out for fear of being pigeon-holed as a presenter,[6] agreed to present what was perceived as a lower-profile show, with the presence of Osman helping to convince him.[5] Laser Crystal Ltd, a manufacturing business based in Poole, Dorset, was contracted to create the trophy awarded to the teams that made it into the final round, creating them from a 120mm tall block of optical quality crystal, and 3D laser-engraved with a stack of 100 Pointless discs and the Pointless logo.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first series aired on the BBC's second channel BBC Two between August and October 2009, with the corporation announcing on the day of the final episode's broadcast that they had commissioned a second series. The series' audience had peaked at 1.69 million viewers, 17.2% of audience share for the timeslot,[3] while averaging around 1 million viewers per episode.[5] The second series saw audiences grow modestly and the format was tweaked prior to the start of series three, reducing the number of rounds and giving more time for banter between the hosts which had previously been edited out.[5] The change saw strong viewer growth with the show subsequently moved to the BBC's main channel BBC One in 2011.[5][7] By 2013, the programme records four episodes in one day,[8] and averaged 3.6 million viewers daily, gaining more viewers than ITV game show The Chase, which also airs in roughly the same time slot.[7]\\r\\nIn February 2014, Pointless was extended for another 204 episodes, giving three more series, taking the total commissioned to 13 in February 2014. A further 24 celebrity episodes were also ordered.[9] For the 1,000th episode, which aired on 16 January 2017, Armstrong and Osman traded host/assistant duties and four previous couples who had distinguished themselves in various ways were invited to compete again. The jackpot for this episode began at S2,500 (the usual starting value for Pointless Celebrities), and every pointless answer during the main game added S1,000 to it. On 23 February 2016, it was announced that the show had been recommissioned by the BBC to make 165 more regular daytime editions along with 45 prime-time celebrity specials, which will see Pointless continue to air on BBC One until at least the end of 2017.[10][11] On 4 September 2017, it was announced that the BBC had commissioned a further 204 episodes which will include 165 regular and 39 celebrity specials.[12]\\r\\nEpisodes of Pointless are shown daily during weekdays, within a tea-time timeslot:\\r\\nEpisodes of celebrity editions are primarily aired on Saturdays, during a prime-time evening timeslot:\\r\\nIn Australia, Pointless has aired on both BBC UKTV (series 10 and 11) and ABC (series 9ÿ11, as at April 2017).[13][14]\\r\\nFollowing a news-themed edition of Pointless Celebrities which aired on 27 October 2014, several fans expressed annoyance at former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie's appearance as a contestant. This was in reference to MacKenzie's infamous \\"The Truth\\" front page report concerning the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Osman responded to this criticism with at least twenty comments on Twitter, stating that he did not know MacKenzie would appear until \\"about an hour before\\" recording and that he had \\"strongly argued against it\\".[18][19][20]\\r\\nOn 26 February 2014, the official Pointless app, Pointless Quiz, was released for iOS,[28] with an iPad, Android and Amazon version released a few months later. The Pointless app features animated versions of Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman and allows the player to tackle questions in a similar format to the TV show.

It is produced by the specialised ependymal cells in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.\\r\\n\\r\\nCSF occupies the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around and inside the brain and spinal cord. It fills the ventricles of the brain, cisterns, and sulci, as well as the central canal of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear via the perilymphatic duct where the perilymph is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sample of CSF can be taken via lumbar puncture. This can reveal the intracranial pressure, as well as indicate diseases including infections of the brain or its surrounding meninges. Although noted by Hippocrates, it was only in the 18th century that Emanuel Swedenborg is credited with its rediscovery, and as late as 1914 that Harvey W. Cushing demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is about 125-150?mL of CSF at any one time.[1] This CSF circulates within the ventricular system of the brain. The ventricles are a series of cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two lateral ventricles. From here, CSF passes through the interventricular foramina to the third ventricle, then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the subarachnoid space through four openings ÿ the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral apertures.[1] CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the sacrum.[1][2] There is a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the perilymph in 93% of people.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSF moves in a single outward direction from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space.[3] Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart.[3] Some authors dispute this, posing that there is no unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSF is derived from blood plasma and is largely similar to it, except that CSF is nearly protein-free compared with plasma and has some different electrolyte levels. Due to the way it is produced, CSF has a higher chloride level than plasma, and an equivalent sodium level.[2][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSF contains approximately 0.3% plasma proteins, or approximately 15 to 40?mg/dL, depending on sampling site.[6] In general, globular proteins and albumin are in lower concentration in ventricular CSF compared to lumbar or cisternal fluid.[7]  This continuous flow into the venous system dilutes the concentration of larger, lipid-insoluble molecules penetrating the brain and CSF.[8] CSF is normally free of red blood cells, and at most contains only a few white blood cells. Any white blood cell count higher than this constitutes pleocytosis.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt around the third week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the notochord. The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue.[10] The neural tube, forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior to the development of the choroid plexuses.[3] The open neuropores of the neural tube close after the first month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the brain develops, by the fourth week of embryological development three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system: the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon.[10] Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day.[3] At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe developing forebrain surrounds the neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within it becomes a ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a choroid plexus develops, producing and releasing CSF.[10] CSF quickly fills the neural canal.[10] Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subcommissural organ secretes SCO-spondin, which forms Reissner's fiber within CSF assisting movement through the cerebral aqueduct. It is present in early intra-uterine life but disappears during early development.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSF serves several purposes:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brain produces roughly 500?mL of cerebrospinal fluid per day,[2] at a rate of about 25?mL an hour.[1] This transcellular fluid is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 125ÿ150?mL is present at any one time.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSF volume is higher on a mL/kg basis in children compared to adults. Infants have a CSF volume of 4 mL/kg, children have a CSF volume of 3 mL/kg, and adults have a CSF volume of 1.5-2 mL/kg. A high CSF volume is why a larger dose of local anesthetic, on a mL/kg basis, is needed in infants. ?Additionally, the larger CSF volume may be one reason as to why children have lower rates of postdural puncture headache.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is produced by the choroid plexus.[1][2] The choroid plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain. It is present throughout the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct, frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, and occipital horn of the lateral ventricle.[16] CSF is also produced by the single layer of column-shaped ependymal cells which line the ventricles; by the lining surrounding the subarachnoid space; and a small amount directly from the tiny spaces surrounding blood vessels around the brain.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSF is produced by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space,[1] with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid.[3] This fluid then needs to pass through the epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into CSF by creating osmotic pressure.[3] Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into CSF.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWater and carbon dioxide from the interstitial fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium.[3] Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen.[2][3] This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into CSF,[2] facilitated by aquaporins.[3] Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality.[2] Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of CSF.[2] As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein.[5] Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into CSF.[3] A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found on the surface of the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.[3][1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOre?kovi? and Klarica hypothesise that CSF is not primarily produced by the choroid plexus, but is being permanently produced inside the entire CSF system, as a consequence of water filtration through the capillary walls into the interstitial fluid of the surrounding brain tissue, regulated by AQP-4.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are circadian variations in CSF secretion, with the mechanisms not fully understood, but potentially relating to differences in the activation of the autonomic nervous system over the course of the day.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nChoroid plexus of the lateral ventricle produces CSF from the arterial blood provided by the choroidal arteries.[18] In the fourth ventricle, CSF is produced from the artierial blood from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (cerebellopontine angle and the adjacent part of the lateral recess), the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (roof and median opening), and the superior cerebellar artery.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSF returns to the vascular system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations.[2] These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage.[2] This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses.[3] CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels,[20] particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known,[1] but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate.[3] CSF turns over at a rate of three to four times a day.[2] CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition and rate of CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF.[3] For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there is less of a pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation.[3] The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it.[3] Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSF pressure, as measured by lumbar puncture, is 10ÿ18 cmH2O (8ÿ15 mmHg or 1.1ÿ2 kPa) with the patient lying on the side and 20ÿ30 cmH2O (16ÿ24 mmHg or 2.1ÿ3.2 kPa) with the patient sitting up.[21] In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4ÿ7.3?mmHg or 0.78ÿ0.98?kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the intracranial pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain.[22] Hydrocephalus can occur because of obstruction of the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality.[22][23] Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur.[22] Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking.[23] In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as the bones of the skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness.[23] A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions,[22][23] and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure.[24] Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid to another part of the body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension is a condition of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc.[22] It can occur in association with the use of Vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women.[22] Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSF can leak from the dura as a result of different causes such as physical trauma or a lumbar puncture, or from no known cause when it is termed a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak.[25] It is usually associated with intracranial hypotension: low CSF pressure.[24] It can cause headaches, made worse by standing, moving and coughing,[24] as the low CSF pressure causes the brain to \\"sag\\" downwards and put pressure on its lower structures.[24] If a leak is identified, a beta-2 transferrin test of the leaking fluid, when positive, is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for CSF leakage.[25] Medical imaging such as CT scans and MRI scans can be used to investigate for a presumed CSF leak when no obvious leak is found but low CSF pressure is identified.[26] Caffeine, given either orally or intravenously, often offers symptomatic relief.[26] Treatment of an identified leak may include injection of a person's blood into the epidural space (an epidural blood patch), spinal surgery, or fibrin glue.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSF can be tested for the diagnosis of a variety of neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture.[27] Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested.[25] About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture,[25] and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nTesting often including observing the colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying white and red blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid.[25][27] The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels.[27] A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection,[25] or PCR may be used to identify a viral cause.[27] Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis;[1] and specific antibodies such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions.[1] A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nLumbar puncture can also be performed to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because it can lead to fatal brain herniation.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome anaesthetics and chemotherapy are injected intrathecally into the subarachnoid space, where they spread around CSF, meaning substances that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier can still be active throughout the central nervous system.[28][29] Baricity refers to the density of a substance compared to the density of human cerebrospinal fluid and is used in general anesthesia to determine the manner in which a particular drug will spread in the intrathecal space.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious comments by ancient physicians have been read as referring to CSF. Hippocrates discussed \\"water\\" surrounding the brain when describing congenital hydrocephalus, and Galen referred to \\"excremental liquid\\" in the ventricles of the brain, which he believed was purged into the nose. But for some 16 intervening centuries of ongoing anatomical study, CSF remained unmentioned in the literature. This is perhaps because of the prevailing autopsy technique, which involved cutting off the head, thereby removing evidence of CSF before the brain was examined.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern rediscovery of CSF is now credited to Emanuel Swedenborg. In a manuscript written between 1741 and 1744, unpublished in his lifetime, Swedenborg referred to CSF as \\"spirituous lymph\\" secreted from the roof of the fourth ventricle down to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. This manuscript was eventually published in translation in 1887.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbrecht von Haller, a Swiss physician and physiologist, made note in his 1747 book on physiology that the \\"water\\" in the brain was secreted into the ventricles and absorbed in the veins, and when secreted in excess, could lead to hydrocephalus.[30] Francois Magendie studied the properties of CSF by vivisection. He discovered the foramen Magendie, the opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle, but mistakenly believed that CSF was secreted by the pia mater.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Willis (noted as the discoverer of the circle of Willis) made note of the fact that the consistency of CSF is altered in meningitis.[30] In 1869 Gustav Schwalbe proposed that CSF drainage could occur via lymphatic vessels.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1891, W. Essex Wynter began treating tubercular meningitis by tapping the subarachnoid space, and Heinrich Quincke began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.[30] In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the first accurate description of the chemical composition of CSF.[30] In 1914, Harvey W. Cushing published conclusive evidence that CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring phylogenesis, CSF is present within the neuraxis before it circulates.[3] The CSF of Teleostei fish is contained within the ventricles of the brains, but not in a nonexistent subarachnoid space.[3] In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, CSF is present in it.[3] Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amount of cerebrospinal fluid varies by size and species.[31] In humans and other mammals, cerebrospinal fluid, produced, circulating, and reabsorbed in a similar manner to humans, and with a similar function, turns over at a rate of 3ÿ5 times a day.[31] Problems with CSF circulation leading to hydrocephalus occur in other animals.[31]","input":"What is the liquid in the brain called?"},{"output":"professional tennis player","context":"","input":"What does serena williams do for a living?"},{"output":"an itchy rash","context":"Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death.[4][5] It typically causes more than one of the following: an itchy rash, throat or tongue swelling, shortness of breath, vomiting, lightheadedness, and low blood pressure.[1] These symptoms typically come on over minutes to hours.[1]\\r\\nCommon causes include insect bites and stings, foods, and medications.[1] Other causes include latex exposure and exercise.[1] Additionally cases may occur without an obvious reason.[1] The mechanism involves the release of mediators from certain types of white blood cells triggered by either immunologic or non-immunologic mechanisms.[6] Diagnosis is based on the presenting symptoms and signs after exposure to a potential allergen.[1]\\r\\nThe primary treatment of anaphylaxis is epinephrine injection into a muscle, intravenous fluids, and positioning the person flat.[1][7] Additional doses of epinephrine may be required.[1] Other measures, such as antihistamines and steroids, are complementary.[1] Carrying an epinephrine autoinjector and identification regarding the condition is recommended in people with a history of anaphylaxis.[1]\\r\\nWorldwide, 0.05ÿ2% of the population is estimated to experience anaphylaxis at some point in life.[3] Rates appear to be increasing.[3] It occurs most often in young people and females.[7][8] Of people who go to a hospital with anaphylaxis in the United States about 0.3% die.[9] The term comes from the Ancient Greek: ??, translit.?ana, lit.?'against', and the Ancient Greek: ?ϫ?, translit.?phylaxis, lit.?'protection'.[10]\\r\\nAnaphylaxis typically presents many different symptoms over minutes or hours[7][11] with an average onset of 5 to 30?minutes if exposure is intravenous and 2?hours if from eating food.[12] The most common areas affected include: skin (80ÿ90%), respiratory (70%), gastrointestinal (30ÿ45%), heart and vasculature (10ÿ45%), and central nervous system (10ÿ15%)[13] with usually two or more being involved.[3]\\r\\nSymptoms typically include generalized hives, itchiness, flushing, or swelling (angioedema) of the afflicted tissues.[4] Those with angioedema may describe a burning sensation of the skin rather than itchiness.[12] Swelling of the tongue or throat occurs in up to about 20% of cases.[14] Other features may include a runny nose and swelling of the conjunctiva.[15] The skin may also be blue tinged because of lack of oxygen.[15]\\r\\nRespiratory symptoms and signs that may be present include shortness of breath, wheezes, or stridor.[4] The wheezing is typically caused by spasms of the bronchial muscles[16] while stridor is related to upper airway obstruction secondary to swelling.[15] Hoarseness, pain with swallowing, or a cough may also occur.[12]\\r\\nWhile a fast heart rate caused by low blood pressure is more common,[15] a BezoldÿJarisch reflex has been described in 10% of people, where a slow heart rate is associated with low blood pressure.[8] A drop in blood pressure or shock (either distributive or cardiogenic) may cause the feeling of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.[16] Rarely very low blood pressure may be the only sign of anaphylaxis.[14]\\r\\nCoronary artery spasm may occur with subsequent myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, or cardiac arrest.[3][13] Those with underlying coronary disease are at greater risk of cardiac effects from anaphylaxis.[16] The coronary spasm is related to the presence of histamine-releasing cells in the heart.[16]\\r\\nGastrointestinal symptoms may include crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.[4] There may be confusion, a loss of bladder control or pelvic pain similar to that of uterine cramps.[4][15] Dilation of blood vessels around the brain may cause headaches.[12] A feeling of anxiety or of \\"impending doom\\" has also been described.[3]\\r\\nAnaphylaxis can occur in response to almost any foreign substance.[17] Common triggers include venom from insect bites or stings, foods, and medication.[8][18] Foods are the most common trigger in children and young adults while medications and insect bites and stings are more common in older adults.[3] Less common causes include: physical factors, biological agents such as semen, latex, hormonal changes, food additives such as monosodium glutamate and food colors, and topical medications.[15] Physical factors such as exercise (known as exercise-induced anaphylaxis) or temperature (either hot or cold) may also act as triggers through their direct effects on mast cells.[3][19] Events caused by exercise are frequently associated with the ingestion of certain foods.[12] During anesthesia, neuromuscular blocking agents, antibiotics, and latex are the most common causes.[20] The cause remains unknown in 32ÿ50% of cases, referred to as \\"idiopathic anaphylaxis.\\"[21] Six vaccines (MMR, varicella, influenza, hepatitis B, tetanus, meningococcal) are recognized as a cause for anaphylaxis, and HPV may cause anaphylaxis as well.[22] Physical exercise is an uncommon cause of anaphylaxis;[23] in about a third of such cases there is a co-factor like taking an NSAID or eating a specific food prior to exercising.[24]\\r\\nMany foods can trigger anaphylaxis; this may occur upon the first known ingestion.[8] Common triggering foods vary around the world. In Western cultures, ingestion of or exposure to peanuts, wheat, nuts, certain types of seafood like shellfish, milk, and eggs are the most prevalent causes.[3][13] Sesame is common in the Middle East, while rice and chickpeas are frequently encountered as sources of anaphylaxis in Asia.[3] Severe cases are usually caused by ingesting the allergen,[8] but some people experience a severe reaction upon contact. Children can outgrow their allergies. By age 16, 80% of children with anaphylaxis to milk or eggs and 20% who experience isolated anaphylaxis to peanuts can tolerate these foods.[17]\\r\\nAny medication may potentially trigger anaphylaxis. The most common are -lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin) followed by aspirin and NSAIDs.[13][25] Other antibiotics are implicated less frequently.[25] Anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs are either agent specific or occur among those that are structurally similar meaning that those who are allergic to one NSAID can typically tolerate a different one or different group of NSAIDs.[26] Other relatively common causes include chemotherapy, vaccines, protamine and herbal preparations.[3] Some medications (vancomycin, morphine, x-ray contrast among others) cause anaphylaxis by directly triggering mast cell degranulation.[8]\\r\\nThe frequency of a reaction to an agent partly depends on the frequency of its use and partly on its intrinsic properties.[27] Anaphylaxis to penicillin or cephalosporins occurs only after it binds to proteins inside the body with some agents binding more easily than others.[12] Anaphylaxis to penicillin occurs once in every 2,000 to 10,000 courses of treatment, with death occurring in fewer than one in every 50,000 courses of treatment.[12] Anaphylaxis to aspirin and NSAIDs occurs in about one in every 50,000 persons.[12] If someone has a reaction to penicillins, his or her risk of a reaction to cephalosporins is greater but still less than one in 1,000.[12] The old radiocontrast agents caused reactions in 1% of cases, while the newer lower osmolar agents cause reactions in 0.04% of cases.[27]\\r\\nVenom from stinging or biting insects such as Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps) or Triatominae (kissing bugs) may cause anaphylaxis in susceptible people.[7][28][29] Previous reactions, that are anything more than a local reaction around the site of the sting, are a risk factor for future anaphylaxis;[30][31] however, half of fatalities have had no previous systemic reaction.[32]\\r\\nPeople with atopic diseases such as asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis are at high risk of anaphylaxis from food, latex, and radiocontrast agents but not from injectable medications or stings.[3][8] One study in children found that 60% had a history of previous atopic diseases, and of children who die from anaphylaxis, more than 90% have asthma.[8] Those with mastocytosis or of a higher socioeconomic status are at increased risk.[3][8] The longer the time since the last exposure to the agent in question, the lower the risk.[12]\\r\\nAnaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction of rapid onset affecting many body systems.[5][6] It is due to the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines from mast cells and basophils, typically due to an immunologic reaction but sometimes non-immunologic mechanism.[6]\\r\\nIn the immunologic mechanism, immunoglobulin E (IgE) binds to the antigen (the foreign material that provokes the allergic reaction). Antigen-bound IgE then activates FcRI receptors on mast cells and basophils. This leads to the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. These mediators subsequently increase the contraction of bronchial smooth muscles, trigger vasodilation, increase the leakage of fluid from blood vessels, and cause heart muscle depression.[6][12] There is also an immunologic mechanism that does not rely on IgE, but it is not known if this occurs in humans.[6]\\r\\nNon-immunologic mechanisms involve substances that directly cause the degranulation of mast cells and basophils. These include agents such as contrast medium, opioids, temperature (hot or cold), and vibration.[6][19] Sulfites may cause reactions by both immunologic and non-immunologic mechanisms.[33]\\r\\nAnaphylaxis is diagnosed on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms.[3] When any one of the following three occurs within minutes or hours of exposure to an allergen there is a high likelihood of anaphylaxis:[3]\\r\\nSkin involvement may include: hives, itchiness or a swollen tongue among others. Respiratory difficulties may include: shortness of breath, stridor, or low oxygen levels among others. Low blood pressure is defined as a greater than 30% decrease from a person's usual blood pressure. In adults a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg is often used.[3]\\r\\nDuring an attack, blood tests for tryptase or histamine (released from mast cells) might be useful in diagnosing anaphylaxis due to insect stings or medications. However these tests are of limited use if the cause is food or if the person has a normal blood pressure,[3] and they are not specific for the diagnosis.[17]\\r\\nThere are three main classifications of anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic shock is associated with systemic vasodilation that causes low blood pressure which is by definition 30% lower than the person's baseline or below standard values.[14] Biphasic anaphylaxis is the recurrence of symptoms within 1ÿ72 hours with no further exposure to the allergen.[3] Reports of incidence vary, with some studies claiming as many as 20% of cases.[34] The recurrence typically occurs within 8 hours.[8] It is managed in the same manner as anaphylaxis.[7] Pseudoanaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions are a type of anaphylaxis that does not involve an allergic reaction but is due to direct mast cell degranulation.[8][35] Non-immune anaphylaxis is the current term used by the World Allergy Organization[35] with some recommending that the old terminology no longer be used.[8]\\r\\nAllergy testing may help in determining the trigger. Skin allergy testing is available for certain foods and venoms.[17] Blood testing for specific IgE can be useful to confirm milk, egg, peanut, tree nut and fish allergies.[17]\\r\\nSkin testing is available to confirm penicillin allergies, but is not available for other medications.[17] Non-immune forms of anaphylaxis can only be determined by history or exposure to the allergen in question, and not by skin or blood testing.[35]\\r\\nIt can sometimes be difficult to distinguish anaphylaxis from asthma, syncope, and panic attacks.[3] Asthma however typically does not entail itching or gastrointestinal symptoms, syncope presents with pallor rather than a rash, and a panic attack may have flushing but does not have hives.[3] Other conditions that may present similarly include: scrombroidosis and anisakiasis.[8]\\r\\nIn a person who died from anaphylaxis, autopsy may show an \\"empty heart\\" attributed to reduced venous return from vasodilation and redistribution of intravascular volume from the central to the peripheral compartment.[36] Other signs are laryngeal edema, eosinophilia in lungs, heart and tissues, and evidence of myocardial hypoperfusion.[37] Laboratory findings could detect increased levels of serum tryptase, increase in total and specific IgE serum levels.[37]\\r\\nAvoidance of the trigger of anaphylaxis is recommended. In cases where this may not be possible, desensitization may be an option. Immunotherapy with Hymenoptera venoms is effective at desensitizing 80ÿ90% of adults and 98% of children against allergies to bees, wasps, hornets, yellowjackets, and fire ants. Oral immunotherapy may be effective at desensitizing some people to certain food including milk, eggs, nuts and peanuts; however, adverse effects are common.[3] For example, many people develop an itchy throat, cough, or lip swelling during immunotherapy.[38] Desensitization is also possible for many medications, however it is advised that most people simply avoid the agent in question. In those who react to latex it may be important to avoid cross-reactive foods such as avocados, bananas, and potatoes among others.[3]\\r\\nAnaphylaxis is a medical emergency that may require resuscitation measures such as airway management, supplemental oxygen, large volumes of intravenous fluids, and close monitoring.[7] Administration of epinephrine is the treatment of choice with antihistamines and steroids (for example, dexamethasone) often used as adjuncts.[7] A period of in-hospital observation for between 2 and 24 hours is recommended for people once they have returned to normal due to concerns of biphasic anaphylaxis.[8][12][34][39]\\r\\nEpinephrine (adrenaline) is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis with no absolute contraindication to its use.[7] It is recommended that an epinephrine solution be given intramuscularly into the mid anterolateral thigh as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. The injection may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes if there is insufficient response.[7] A second dose is needed in 16-35% of episodes with more than two doses rarely required.[7] The intramuscular route is preferred over subcutaneous administration because the latter may have delayed absorption.[7][40] Minor adverse effects from epinephrine include tremors, anxiety, headaches, and palpitations.[3]\\r\\nPeople on -blockers may be resistant to the effects of epinephrine.[8] In this situation if epinephrine is not effective intravenous glucagon can be administered which has a mechanism of action independent of -receptors.[8]\\r\\nIf necessary, it can also be given intravenously using a dilute epinephrine solution. Intravenous epinephrine, however, has been associated both with dysrhythmia and myocardial infarction.[7] Epinephrine autoinjectors used for self-administration typically come in two doses, one for adults or children who weigh more than 25?kg and one for children who weigh 10 to 25?kg.[41]\\r\\nAntihistamines (both H1 and H2), while commonly used and assumed effective based on theoretical reasoning, are poorly supported by evidence.[42][43] A 2007 Cochrane review did not find any good-quality studies upon which to base recommendations[43] and they are not believed to have an effect on airway edema or spasm.[8] Corticosteroids are unlikely to make a difference in the current episode of anaphylaxis, but may be used in the hope of decreasing the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis. Their prophylactic effectiveness in these situations is uncertain.[34] Nebulized salbutamol may be effective for bronchospasm that does not resolve with epinephrine.[8] Methylene blue has been used in those not responsive to other measures due to its presumed effect of relaxing smooth muscle.[8]\\r\\nPeople prone to anaphylaxis are advised to have an \\"allergy action plan.\\" Parents are advised to inform schools of their children's allergies and what to do in case of an anaphylactic emergency. The action plan usually includes use of epinephrine autoinjectors, the recommendation to wear a medical alert bracelet, and counseling on avoidance of triggers.[44] Immunotherapy is available for certain triggers to prevent future episodes of anaphylaxis. A multi-year course of subcutaneous desensitization has been found effective against stinging insects, while oral desensitization is effective for many foods.[13]\\r\\nIn those in whom the cause is known and prompt treatment is available, the prognosis is good.[45] Even if the cause is unknown, if appropriate preventative medication is available, the prognosis is generally good.[12] If death occurs, it is usually due to either respiratory (typically asphyxia) or cardiovascular causes (shock),[6][8] with 0.7ÿ20% of cases causing death.[12][16] There have been cases of death occurring within minutes.[3] Outcomes in those with exercise-induced anaphylaxis are typically good, with fewer and less severe episodes as people get older.[21]\\r\\nThe number of people who get anaphylaxis is 4ÿ100 per 100,000 persons per year,[8][46] with a lifetime risk of 0.05ÿ2%.[47] About 30% of people get more than one attack.[46] Exercise-induced anaphylaxis affects about 1 in 2000 young people.[24]\\r\\nRates appear to be increasing: with the numbers in the 1980s being approximately 20 per 100,000 per year, while in the 1990s it was 50 per 100,000 per year.[13] The increase appears to be primarily for food-induced anaphylaxis.[48] The risk is greatest in young people and females.[7][8]\\r\\nAnaphylaxis leads to as many as 500ÿ1,000 deaths per year (2.7 per million) in the United States, 20 deaths per year in the United Kingdom (0.33 per million), and 15 deaths per year in Australia (0.64 per million).[8] Another estimate from the United States puts the death rate at 0.7 per million.[49] Mortality rates have decreased between the 1970s and 2000s.[50] In Australia, death from food-induced anaphylaxis occur primarily in women while deaths due to insect bites primarily occur in males.[8] Death from anaphylaxis is most commonly triggered by medications.[8]\\r\\nThe term aphylaxis was coined by Charles Richet in 1902 and later changed to anaphylaxis due to its nicer quality of speech.[17] In his experiments, Richet injected a dog with sea anemone (Actinia) toxin in an attempt to protect it. Although the dog had previously tolerated the toxin, on re-exposure, three weeks later with the same dose, it developed fatal anaphylaxis. Thus instead of inducing tolerance (prophylaxis), when lethal responses resulted from previously tolerated doses, he coined the word a (without) phylaxis (protection). He was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on anaphylaxis in 1913.[12] The phenomenon itself, however, has been described since ancient times.[35] The term comes from the Greek words ??, ana, meaning \\"against\\", and ?ϫ?, phylaxis, meaning \\"protection\\".[51]\\r\\nThere are ongoing efforts to develop sublingual epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis.[8] Subcutaneous injection of the anti-IgE antibody omalizumab is being studied as a method of preventing recurrence, but it is not yet recommended.[3][52]","input":"What are the symptoms of a systemic anaphylactic reaction?"},{"output":"infectious mononucleosis, also known as 'glandular fever', 'mono' and 'Pfeiffer's disease'","context":"There are several forms of EpsteinÿBarr virus infection. Infectious mononucleosis, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma can all be caused by the EpsteinÿBarr virus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEpsteinÿBarr can cause infectious mononucleosis, also known as 'glandular fever', 'mono' and 'Pfeiffer's disease'. Infectious mononucleosis is caused when a person is first exposed to the virus during or after adolescence. It is predominantly found in the developing world, and most children in the developing world are found to have already been infected by around 18 months of age. Infection of children can occur when adults mouth feed or pre-chew food before giving it to the child.[1] EBV antibody tests turn up almost universally positive. In the United States roughly half of five-year-olds have been infected.[2]\\r\\nThe strongest evidence linking EBV and cancer formation is found in Burkitt's lymphoma[3] and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Additionally, it has been postulated to be a trigger for a subset of chronic fatigue syndrome patients[4] as well as multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.[5]\\r\\nBurkitt's lymphoma is a type of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is most common in equatorial Africa and is co-existent with the presence of malaria.[6] Malaria infection causes reduced immune surveillance of B cells immortalized by EBV, resulting in an excessive number of B cells and an increased likelihood of an unchecked mutation. Repeated mutations can lead to loss of cell-cycle control, causing excessive proliferation observed as Burkitt's lymphoma. Burkitt's lymphoma commonly affects the jaw bone, forming a huge tumor mass. It responds quickly to chemotherapy treatment, namely cyclophosphamide, but recurrence is common.\\r\\nOther B cell lymphomas arise in immunocompromised patients such as those with AIDS or who have undergone organ transplantation with associated immunosuppression (Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLPD)). Smooth muscle tumors are also associated with the virus in malignant patients.[7]\\r\\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma is a cancer found in the upper respiratory tract, most commonly in the nasopharynx, and is linked to the EBV virus. It is found predominantly in Southern China and Africa, due to both genetic and environmental factors. It is much more common in people of Chinese ancestry (genetic), but is also linked to the Chinese diet of a high amount of smoked fish, which contain nitrosamines, well known carcinogens (environmental).[8]\\r\\nSymptoms of infectious mononucleosis are fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands. Sometimes, a swollen spleen or liver involvement may develop. Heart problems or involvement of the central nervous system occurs only rarely, and infectious mononucleosis is almost never fatal. There are no known associations between active EBV infection and problems during pregnancy, such as miscarriages or birth defects.[9][10] Although the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis usually resolve in 1 or 2 months, EBV remains dormant or latent in a few cells in the throat and blood for the rest of the person's life. Periodically, the virus can reactivate and is commonly found in the saliva of infected persons. Reactivated and post-latent virus may pass the placental barrier in (also seropositive) pregnant women via macrophages and therefore can infect the fetus. Also re-infection of prior seropositive individuals may occur. In contrast, reactivation in adults usually occurs without symptoms of illness.\\r\\nEBV also establishes a lifelong dormant infection in some cells of the body's immune system. A late event in a very few carriers of this virus is the emergence of Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, two rare cancers. EBV appears to play an important role in these malignancies, but is probably not the sole cause of disease.\\r\\nMost individuals exposed to people with infectious mononucleosis have previously been infected with EBV and are not at risk for infectious mononucleosis. In addition, transmission of EBV requires intimate contact with the saliva (found in the mouth) of an infected person. Transmission of this virus through the air or blood does not normally occur. The incubation period, or the time from infection to appearance of symptoms, ranges from 4 to 6 weeks. Persons with infectious mononucleosis may be able to spread the infection to others for a period of weeks. However, no special precautions or isolation procedures are recommended, since the virus is also found frequently in the saliva of healthy people. In fact, many healthy people can carry and spread the virus intermittently for life. These people are usually the primary reservoir for person-to-person transmission. For this reason, transmission of the virus is almost impossible to prevent.\\r\\nThe clinical diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is suggested on the basis of the symptoms of fever, sore throat, swollen lymph glands, and the age of the patient. Usually, laboratory tests are needed for confirmation. Serologic results for persons with infectious mononucleosis include an elevated white blood cell count, an increased percentage of certain atypical white blood cells, and a positive reaction to a \\"mono spot\\" test.\\r\\nThere is no specific treatment for infectious mononucleosis, other than treating the symptoms. In severe cases, steroids such as corticosteroids may be used to control the swelling of the throat and tonsils. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines available.\\r\\nIt is important to note that symptoms related to infectious mononucleosis caused by EBV infection seldom last for more than 4 months. When such an illness lasts more than 6 months, it is frequently called chronic EBV infection. However, valid laboratory evidence for continued active EBV infection is seldom found in these patients. The illness should be investigated further to determine if it meets the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome, or CFS. This process includes ruling out other causes of chronic illness or fatigue.","input":"What is the acute infection caused by the epstein-barr virus?"},{"output":"310 feet from home plate","context":"The Green Monster is a popular nickname for the 37.2 feet (11.3?m) high left field wall at Fenway Park, home to the Boston Red Sox baseball team. The wall is 310 feet from home plate and is a popular target for right-handed hitters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wall was part of the original ballpark construction of 1912, along Fenway's north side facing Lansdowne Street.  It is made of wood and was covered in tin and concrete in 1934.  It was then covered with hard plastic in 1976. A manual scoreboard is set into the wall, which has been there, in one form or another, at least as far back as 1914 (see photo at right). Despite the name, the Green Monster was not painted green until 1947; before that, it was covered with advertisements. The Monster designation is relatively new. For most of its history it was simply called \\"The Wall.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Green Monster is the highest among the walls in current Major League Baseball fields, and is the second highest among all professional baseball fields (including minor leagues), falling approximately 6 inches short of the left field wall at the PeoplesBank Park in York, Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nBallparks occupied by professional baseball teams have often featured high fences to hide the field from external viewers, particularly behind open areas of the outfield where bleacher seating is low-lying or non-existent. The wall might also reduce the number of \\"cheap\\" home runs due to the barrier's relatively close distance to home plate. Fenway's wall serves both purposes. Past ballparks of Fenway's era or even later which featured high fences in-play included Baker Bowl, Washington Park, Ebbets Field, League Park, Griffith Stadium, Shibe Park, and more recently, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Fenway is the last of the exceptionally high-walled major league ballparks. Relatively high walls in modern ballparks have been constructed for their novelty rather than by necessity, as Fenway's wall had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Green Monster is famous for preventing home runs on many line drives that would clear the walls of other ballparks. A side effect of this is to increase the prevalence of doubles, since this is the most common result when the ball is hit off the wall (often referred to as a \\"wallball double\\"). Some left fielders, predominantly those with vast Fenway experience, have become adept at fielding caroms off the wall to throw runners out at second base or hold the batter to a single. Compared with other current major league parks, the wall's placement creates a comparatively shallow left field; the wall falls approximately 304ÿ310 feet (93ÿ94?m) from the plate along the left-field foul line. With this short distance, many deep fly balls that could be caught by the fielder in a deeper park rebound off the wall for base hits. And while the wall turns many would-be line-drive homers into doubles it also allows some high yet shallow fly balls to clear the field of play for a home run.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 2001 and 2002, the Green Monster's height record was temporarily beaten by the center field wall at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio.  During the construction of Great American Ball Park, located right next to Riverfront Stadium, a large section of seats was removed from the center field area to make room and a 40-foot (12?m) black wall was erected as a temporary batter's eye. The entire wall was in play. This new wall was often called \\"The Black Monster.\\" When Riverfront Stadium was demolished in 2002, the Green Monster reclaimed the record. In honor of the famed wall, the Red Sox mascot is a furry green monster named Wally the Green Monster.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1912 to 1933, a 10-foot-high (3.0?m) mound formed an incline in front of the Green Monster,[1] extending from the left-field foul pole to the center field flag pole. This earthwork formed a \\"terrace\\", a common feature of ballparks of the day, whose purpose was to make up the difference in grade between street level and field level, as with Cincinnati's Crosley Field. It also served to double as a seating area to handle overflow crowds, another common practice of that era.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the terrace, when overflow crowds weren't seated atop it, a left fielder in Fenway Park had to play the territory running uphill. Boston's first star left fielder, Duffy Lewis, mastered the skill so well that the area became known as \\"Duffy's Cliff\\".[1] In contrast, rotund outfielder Bob Fothergill, known by the indelicate nicknames of \\"Fats\\" or \\"Fatty\\", reportedly once chased a ball up the terrace, slipped and fell, and rolled downhill.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1934, Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey arranged to flatten the ground in left field so that Duffy's Cliff no longer existed, and it became part of the lore of Fenway Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scoreboard was added in 1934. It forms the lower half of the Green Monster and is still updated by hand from behind the wall throughout the game. The American League scores are also updated from behind the wall.  The National League scores need to be updated from the front of the wall between innings.[2]  There is also a board which shows the current American League East standings.  There are 127 slots in the wall and a team of three score keepers move around two-pound, 13-by-16-inch plates to represent the score. Yellow numbers are used to represent in-inning scores and white numbers are used to represent final inning tallies. The numbers of the current pitchers weigh three pounds and measure 16 by 16 inches.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlton Fisk's \\"body English\\" when he hit his game-winning home run in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, \\"waving\\" the ball fair, was captured on a TV camera stationed in the scoreboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Morse Code that appears from top to bottom in the white lines of the American League scoreboard are the initials of former owners Thomas A. Yawkey and Jean R. Yawkey.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFenway's left-field distortion is offset by the odd shape and generous size of right field, which is 302 feet (92?m) (although its actual distance has been disputed over the years) along the line (almost the same as in left), but 380 feet (120?m) at its deepest.  The bullpen was added along the right field wall in 1940 to shorten the distance for left-handed slugger Ted Williams' home runs to clear the fence.  For years afterward, the bullpens were known as \\"Williamsburg\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1936, the Red Sox installed a 23-foot (7.0?m) net above the Monster in order to protect the storefronts on adjoining Lansdowne Street from home run balls. The net remained until the 2002ÿ03 offseason, when the team's new ownership constructed a new seating section atop the wall to accommodate 274 fans. Wildly popular, these \\"Monster seats\\" were part of a larger expansion plan for Fenway Park seating. The Red Sox later added a smaller seating section in 2005, dubbed the \\"Nation's Nest,\\" located between the main seating section and the center field scoreboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nComprising yet another quirk, a ladder is attached to the Green Monster, extending from near the upper-left portion of the scoreboard, 13 feet (4.0?m) above ground, to the top of the wall. Previously, members of the grounds crew would use the ladder to retrieve home run balls from the netting hung above the wall. After the net was removed for the addition of the Monster seats, the ladder ceased to have any real function, yet it still remains in place as a historic relic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe placement of the ladder is noteworthy given the fact that it is in fair territory; it is the only such ladder in the major leagues. On many occasions, a batted ball has struck the ladder during game play, at least twice leading to an inside-the-park home run.[5]  During a 1950s game, Red Sox outfielders Ted Williams and Jimmy Piersall both tracked a fly ball in left center, but the ball struck the ladder and caromed into center field, giving batter Jim Lemon enough time to round the bases.  Later, in 1963, the slow-footed Dick Stuart hit a high fly that ricocheted first off the ladder, and then the head of outfielder Vic Davalillo, before rolling far enough away to allow Stuart to score.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the wall was painted green in 1947, advertisements did not appear on the wall until 1999, when the All-Star Game at Fenway was being promoted. Various ads have appeared above the scoreboard since then, such as the Jimmy Fund, W.B. Mason, and Granite City Electric. The Coke Bottles on the left light tower were a target for power-hitters when they were placed in 1997. These 3D advertisements were taken down before the 2008 season, when an LED sign was built above the new left-field upper deck seats. As a lead up to his 500th career home run, Manny Ramirez's home run count was tallied on the bottom of the light tower. Ads beside the manual scoreboard were added when the scoreboard was expanded. Above the manual scoreboard, where a Jimmy Fund advertisement had remained for many years, the logo for Foxwoods Resort Casino is now a prominent aspect of Fenway Park. Outside of Fenway in Kenmore Square, but able to be seen in the view above the left-field wall, is the Boston Citgo sign.","input":"How far is it to the green monster?"},{"output":"New Orleans","context":"American Horror Story: Coven is the third season of the FX horror anthology television series American Horror Story.

The season garnered seventeen Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Miniseries and five acting nominations for Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, Angela Bassett, Frances Conroy, and Kathy Bates, with Lange and Bates winning their respective acting categories. In addition, Coven was nominated for Best Miniseries or TV Film at the Golden Globe Awards.\\r\\nIn the series' fifth cycle, Hotel, Gabourey Sidibe reprised her role as Queenie in the eleventh episode of the season.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third season follows a Coven of Salem descendants who reside within Miss Robichaux's Academy in New Orleans. Zoe Benson (Taissa Farmiga) is sent to the Academy after discovering her dark power: she can magically induce brain hemorrhaging in any man by having sex with him. Upon arrival, she meets Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts), a telekinetic and a recovering drug abuser who was once a child film star; Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe), a descendant of Tituba with the power to inflict wounds on others by harming herself, without feeling any pain; and Nan (Jamie Brewer), an enigmatic clairvoyant who can hear the thoughts of others.\\r\\nThe Academy is run by headmistress Cordelia Foxx (Sarah Paulson), who has always lived in the shadow of her mother, Fiona Goode (Jessica Lange). Fiona is the Coven's \\"Supreme\\", a witch born every generation who embodies specific gifts and magical abilities known as the Seven Wonders of Witchcraft. The Academy is looked after by Spalding (Denis O'Hare), a mute butler who has a mysterious relationship with Fiona. The Coven is assessed by the Council of Witchcraft, which includes Fiona's old rival and Cordelia's mother figure, Myrtle Snow (Frances Conroy).\\r\\nAt a party, Zoe meets fraternity president Kyle Spencer (Evan Peters), who takes a liking to her. Madison is gang-raped by Kyle's frat brothers and, as revenge, uses her power to flip their bus, killing Kyle and six others. Two of the boys survive and are placed in critical care. Zoe goes to the hospital and kills the remaining rapist with her power. To repay Zoe, Madison revives a dismembered Kyle by attaching his frat brothers' severed limbs to his head and casting a resurrection spell, but he returns frightened and simple-minded. It is revealed that Kyle's mother sexually abused him, making it hard for him to be trusting of physical touch. His revived corpse attracts Misty Day (Lily Rabe), a witch who resurrected herself after being burned at the stake.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Fiona is cursed with an untreatable cancer due to a new Supreme rising. She tries, in vain, to regain her youth and cure herself. Voodoo priestess and the Salem witches' rival, Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett), has gained immortality by dealing with a voodoo spirit, Papa Legba (Lance Reddick). Fiona frees Marie's immortal prisoner, 19th-century slave killer Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates), who becomes the Academy's maid. She struggles to adjust to the modern world due to her inherent racism. Fiona believes Madison is the next Supreme and slits her throat; Spalding helps cover it up. Zoe discovers Spalding's secrets and kills him, turning him into a ghost that haunts the Academy. Cordelia is blinded in an acid attack by witch hunters, one of whom is her husband. Myrtle is framed by Fiona, with Queenie's help, and is burned at the stake.\\r\\nIn 1919, witches of the Academy killed the notorious serial killer the Axeman (Danny Huston), whose spirit has since been confined inside the Academy's walls. He is freed when Zoe tries to contact the ghost of Madison via ouija board. He then begins a twisted romance with Fiona. Misty revives Myrtle and Madison, both of whom return with vengeful notions; Madison seduces Kyle behind Zoe's back, and Myrtle slaughters the Council of Witchcraft.

Queenie returns with a reattached Delphine. Marie, Fiona, and the Axeman slaughter the witch hunters. Spalding's ghost helps Delphine dissect Marie. Madison attempts to eliminate Supreme competition by entombing Misty, but she is brought back by Queenie and Cordelia. Queenie kills Delphine after making a deal with Legba to return her mortality. Marie and Delphine are banished to hell for eternity due to their actions in life. Fiona makes the Axeman believe he has murdered her, and the witches kill him in return.\\r\\nThe Coven sets out to find the next Supreme with the test of Seven Wonders. Misty and Zoe die while attempting different tests. Queenie is disqualified when she is unable to revive Zoe. Madison can but refuses, and angrily leaves after she fails a test. Kyle then kills her for not saving Zoe. Cordelia enters the competition and successfully brings Zoe back. She becomes the new Supreme, regains her sight, and reveals the Coven to the world. Myrtle is burned once again for murdering the Council. Zoe and Queenie are appointed seats on the Council, and Kyle becomes the new butler. Fiona returns to the Coven alive but withered from cancer. She makes amends with Cordelia, before dying in her arms. Fiona is then banished to hell with the Axeman. Cordelia, Zoe, Queenie, and Kyle open the doors to the Academy, welcoming the new recruitment of witches.\\r\\nIn January 2013, series co-creator Ryan Murphy hinted that a clue about the third season would be hidden in the tenth episode of the second season.[14] In a later interview discussing that episode, he stated, \\"I sorta feel like for the third version I want to do something that's a little bit more 'evil glamour.' Just something that's a little bit more...one of the things that I missed this season was I really loved having that Romeo and Juliet youth story with Violet and Tate [from the first season]. I want something like that again and we're doing something like that in the third season. And we're contemplating shooting the show in a different place. We're contemplating shooting it in a place in the country where true horror has been.\\"[15] In another interview, Murphy added that the season would be set in the modern day.[16]\\r\\nExecutive producer Tim Minear has stated that, while this season's tone might be lighter with more humor, the global themes of it will be \\"oppression of minorities of all kinds, and within that idea, minority groups going after each other and doing the work of the larger culture.\\" He added, \\"While there is a strong feminist theme that runs throughout Coven, there are themes of race and themes of oppression, and themes of family ÿ especially mothers and daughters.\\"[17]\\r\\nIn October 2016, Murphy stated that a future season of the show will feature a return/continuation of Coven. However, that season is to be determined. He stated that this is not the theme for season 7, but a later season. He also confirmed that Lady Gaga's character from Roanoke is the first Supreme.[18] Later that month, Murphy announced that the season would be a Coven and Murder House crossover continuation. Merging stories, themes and characters. He also stated that he had begun reaching out to actors from both seasons to reprise their respective roles.[19]\\r\\nSeries executive producers and co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk stated that, as with the second season, \\"many actors\\" would return for the third season in different roles.[20] Jessica Lange, Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson all confirmed their returns. Murphy added that Lange would portray a \\"real glamour-cat lady\\",[16] whose name was later revealed to be Fiona Goode.[21] Paulson said in an interview that her character would \\"definitely [be] different [to her season two character].\\" She added, \\"Basically, she's going to look different, and my relationship to Lange is going to be quite different this time. At the beginning of last season, no one knew that Lana would be the hero, so it's possible I could end up the evil one this year. As of right now, there will be some of Lana Winters' qualities in my character, but I don't know for sure.\\"[22] Taissa Farmiga, who played a lead role in the first season, starred as Zoe Benson, a character involved in a prominent romance with Peters' character.[23] Lily Rabe and Frances Conroy portrayed series regulars Misty Day and Myrtle Snow, respectively.[23][24] Kathy Bates co-starred as Delphine LaLaurie, an evil woman from the past who tortures her slaves.[25] Murphy stated that Bates' character would be \\"five times worse than [her] Misery character\\" and is also inspired by a \\"true event\\".[26] It was reported on May 22, 2013 that Emma Roberts would co-star as Madison Montgomery, a difficult Hollywood starlet.[27]\\r\\nIn May 2013, Murphy announced via Twitter that Angela Bassett and Patti LuPone had joined the cast.[28] Bassett later confirmed she would be playing voodoo priestess, Marie Laveau. In an interview, LuPone said that her character, Joan Ramsey, would not be a witch but \\"the personification of the religious right, 'like Piper Laurie in Carrie.'\\"[29] Gabourey Sidibe appeared in 12 episodes of the season portraying Queenie, a young witch, whose prominent ability allows her to become a human voodoo doll.[30] First season actress Jamie Brewer recurred as Nan, a young witch who is clairvoyant.\\r\\nIn July and August 2013, Murphy announced through Twitter that first season alums Denis O'Hare and Alexandra Breckenridge had joined the cast in unknown roles, later known as Spalding and Kaylee, respectively.[31][32] Also in August, Murphy announced that Christine Ebersole would be playing a \\"Glinda the Good Witch-type of gal\\", who is Fiona's predecessor.[33] In an interview, Jessica Lange revealed that Mare Winningham had joined the cast as Peters' character's mother, Alicia Spencer.[34] Leslie Jordan announced that he had joined the cast as Quentin Fleming, a high-ranking witch.[35] In September 2013, Alexander Dreymon was cast in the role of Luke Ramsey. Described as \\"the handsome young man who moves in next door to the Academy\\".[36] Danny Huston, Josh Hamilton, and Lance Reddick all recurred throughout the season as the Axeman, Hank Foxx, and Papa Legba, respectively. Murphy also invited singer Stevie Nicks to be a part of the season. She appeared in two episodes, \\"The Magical Delights of Stevie Nicks\\" and \\"The Seven Wonders\\".\\r\\nPrincipal photography for the season began on July 23, 2013,[37] in New Orleans, Louisiana.[38] The casting call reads, \\"After two seasons shooting in Los Angeles, the series moves to [New Orleans] for its third season. Filming begins July 23, 2013 in New Orleans, Louisiana and [will be] completed on January 17, 2014.\\"[39] Despite Ryan Murphy stating that the third season would take place in multiple cities,[16] New Orleans is the primary setting of the third installment.[17]\\r\\nWitches are humans gifted with the power to affect change by supernatural or paranormal means, a practice known as \\"witchcraft\\". Witches are generally female, though there are a few male witches, referred to as \\"warlocks\\". Because of their unnatural abilities and supposed connections with dark forces, witches have historically been feared, persecuted, and hunted. Many escaped the Salem witch trials and sought refuge in New Orleans.[40] Among the population of witches, there is always one witch per generation who possesses a class of seven powers considered to be advanced acts of magic. This witch is known as the \\"Supreme\\". As the witches settled in their new territory, a rivalry between them and the native Voodoo practitioners arose. The feud is still ongoing in present day New Orleans.[41] A group of witches are the focus of Coven, in which magic is a genetic heredity that connects a person to the elements and forces of nature in order to practice witchcraft.\\r\\nIt has been attested that the witches of Salem received their power from the Voodoo slave girl Tituba, though evidently, their abilities stem from a genetic affliction that is passed down through bloodlines.[42] During the Salem witch trials in 1692, witches faced persecution and decided to flee south in the midst of the hysteria. However, their ailing Supreme, Prudence Mather, was unable to make the journey and decided to take her own life in a ritual known as the Sacred Taking.[43] This selfless act allowed a new Supreme to take power and lead the Coven to safety, where they eventually settled in New Orleans. The generations of witches to follow would become known as the \\"Salem descendants\\".\\r\\nThe governing body of the witches and warlocks, depicted as elders and known as the \\"Council of Wichcraft\\", are very old fashioned as they still use typewriters in modern times. They are responsible for policing witch crimes, the concealment of witchcraft to the uninitiated, and for the welcoming of potential students to Miss Robichaux's Academy.[42] The council only visits the Coven on very important cases, such as the death of another witch.[44]\\r\\nThe Supreme Witch, known more colloquially as the Supreme, is a worldwide recognized status among the witches descending from the Salem witch trials. While most witches possess only a handful of gifts, the Supreme is said to embody multiple, if not all, gifts. Historically, there is said to be only one Supreme per generation (approximately 30ÿ50 years). Part of being a Supreme means no ailments or diseases would harm them.[45] The Supreme role comes with the responsibility of the entire Coven as a leader of the new generation. One of the most important tasks of the Supreme is to identify her successor, a task that wasn't accomplished by former Supreme Fiona Goode, and, as a consequence, multiple girls were tested and one of them died trying to perform the Seven Wonders.\\r\\nAs a new Supreme flowers, the life force of the current regnant gradually fades, which manifests as multiple organ failures, disease, and cancer due to the crippled immune system. In the cases where a new Supreme must rise before the natural death of the incumbent, a ritual known as \\"The Sacred Taking\\" is employed; it is a stylized suicide blessed by Coven members. It was developed when the ailing Prudence Mather was not able to make the journey to relocate the Coven to New Orleans during the Salem Witch Trials, and allowed a potential to ascend to Supremacy. Fiona inherited her powers earlier than most Supremes (she was in her late teens to early twenties at the time) because she killed her generation's Supreme and self-ascended. Fiona lived for a while after Cordelia became the Supreme, but had already become very weak and sickly.\\r\\nAccording to Ryan Murphy, the original Supreme is Scthach, from Roanoke.[46] Scthach is an immortal English woman descending from the Druids and their Roman conqueror, and is a practitioner of prehistoric Celtic religion and a worshipper of the Old Gods. She was a stowaway on a British voyage destined for the colonies, but the ship's occupants all died. The colonists discovered her upon landfall and blamed her presence for enraging the sea gods. She was subsequently imprisoned and sentenced to be burned at the stake for witchcraft. Using her darker powers, she massacred the soldiers. This was later blamed on Natives, and Scthach escaped into the wild. Prudence Mather was the Supreme of Salem. Marion Warton, the purchaser of Miss Robichaux's Academy and the predecessor of Mimi DeLongpre, was followed by Anna-Leigh Leighton, Fiona Goode and the current Supreme, Cordelia Foxx.\\r\\nA number of magical powers and abilities have been showcased in Coven. Some abilities are inherent or reflexive to certain witches, that is they do not need to focus or concentrate. It is not rare for a witch to manifest more than three powers, though a Supreme is required to have at least seven (the Seven Wonders), though not necessarily all possible powers. It is said that the reason that a Supreme is so powerful is because she is the physical embodiment of many and or all powers. Witches are shown to be able to use their powers collectively.[47] Certain abilities can also be triggered by certain events and substances. Voodoo and witchcraft practitioners share certain powers.\\r\\nAll Supremes are assumed to have demonstrated these abilities during their ascension to Supremacy, despite not necessarily being depicted. The explicit depictions of the seven gifts are:\\r\\nSimilar to the prior seasons, FX published mini teaser trailers for Coven on the show's Facebook page.[48]\\r\\nAmerican Horror Story: Coven has received positive reviews.

The lands of the settlement were located in central New England in what is now Massachusetts, with initial settlements situated on two natural harbors and surrounding land, about 15.4 miles (24.8?km) apart[1]the areas around the present-day cities of Salem and Boston.\\r\\nThe territory nominally administered by the colony included much of present-day central New England, including portions of the U.S. states of Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. Territory claimed but never administered by the colonial government extended as far west as the Pacific Ocean. The earlier Dutch colony of New Netherlands disputed many of these claims, arguing that they held rights to lands beyond Rhode Island up to the western side of Cape Cod and the Plymouth Bay Colony.\\r\\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony was founded by the owners of the Massachusetts Bay Company, which included investors in the failed Dorchester Company that had established a short-lived settlement on Cape Ann in 1623. The colony began in 1628 and was the company's second attempt at colonization. It was successful, with about 20,000 people migrating to New England in the 1630s. The population was strongly Puritan, and its governance was dominated by a small group of leaders who were strongly influenced by Puritan religious leaders. Its governors were elected, and the electorate were limited to freemen who had been examined for their religious views and formally admitted to the local church. As a consequence, the colonial leadership exhibited intolerance to other religious views, including Anglican, Quaker, and Baptist theologies.\\r\\nThe colonists initially had good relationships with the local Indian populations, but frictions developed that ultimately led to the Pequot War (1636ÿ38) and then to King Philip's War (1675ÿ78), after which most of the Indians in southern New England made peace treaties with the colonists (apart from the Pequot tribe, whose survivors largely merged with the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes after the Pequot War).\\r\\nThe colony was economically successful, engaging in trade with England and the West Indies. A shortage of hard currency in the colony prompted it to establish a mint in 1652. Political differences with England after the English Restoration led to the revocation of the colonial charter in 1684. King James II established the Dominion of New England in 1686 to bring all of the New England colonies under firmer crown control. The dominion collapsed after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 deposed James, and the colony reverted to rule under the revoked charter until the charter for the Province of Massachusetts Bay was issued in 1691, which combined the Massachusetts Bay territories with those of the Plymouth Colony and proprietary holdings on Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. Sir William Phips arrived in 1692 bearing the charter and formally took charge of the new province. The political and economic dominance of New England by the modern state of Massachusetts was made possible in part by the early dominance in these spheres by the Massachusetts Bay colonists.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans on the eastern shore of New England, the area around Massachusetts Bay was the territory of several Algonquian-speaking tribes, including the Massachusett, Nauset, and Wampanoag. The Pennacooks occupied the Merrimack River valley to the north, and the Nipmuc, Pocumtuc, and Mahican occupied the western lands of present-day Massachusetts, although some of those tribes were under tribute to the Mohawks, who were expanding aggressively from present-day upstate New York.[2] The total Indian population in 1620 has been estimated to be 7,000[3] with the population of New England at 15ÿ18,000.[4] This number was significantly larger as late as 1616; in later years, contemporary chroniclers interviewed Indians who described a major pestilence that killed between one- and two-thirds of the population. The land-use patterns of the natives included plots cleared for agricultural purposes, and woodland territories for the hunting of game. Land divisions between the tribes were well understood.[3]\\r\\nDuring the early 17th century, several European explorers charted the area, including Samuel de Champlain and John Smith.[5] Plans began in 1606 for the first permanent British settlements on the east coast of North America. On April 10, 1606, King James I of England (James VI of Scotland) granted a charter forming two joint-stock companies. Neither of these corporations was given a name by this charter, but the territories were named as the \\"first Colony\\" (fourth paragraph of charter) and \\"second Colony\\" (fifth paragraph of charter), over which they were respectively authorized to settle and to govern. Under this charter, the \\"first Colony\\" and the \\"second Colony\\" were to be ruled by a \\"Council\\" composed of 13 individuals in each colony. The charter provided for an additional council of 13 persons to have overarching responsibility for the combined enterprise. No name was given to either the company or council governing the respective colonies; the council governing the whole was named \\"Council of Virginia.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe \\"first Colony\\" ranged from the 34th- to 41st-degree latitude north; the \\"second Colony\\" ranged from the 38th- to 45th-degree latitude. (Note that the \\"first Colony\\" and the \\"second Colony\\" overlapped. The 1629 charter of Charles I asserted that the second Colony ranged from 40th to 48th degrees north latitude, which reduces the overlap.) The investors appointed to govern over any settlements in the \\"first Colony\\" were from London; the investors appointed to govern over any settlements in the \\"second Colony\\" were from the \\"Town of Plimouth in the County of Devon.\\"[citation needed] The London Company proceeded to establish Jamestown.[7] The Plymouth Company under the guidance of Sir Ferdinando Gorges covered the more northern area, including present-day New England, and established the Sagadahoc Colony in 1607 in present-day Maine.[8] The experience proved exceptionally difficult for the 120 settlers, however, and the surviving colonists abandoned the colony after only one year.[9] Gorges noted that \\"there was no more speech of settling plantations in those parts\\" for a number of years.[10] English ships continued to come to the New England area for fishing and trade with the Indians.[11]\\r\\nIn December 1620, a group of Pilgrims established Plymouth Colony just to the south of Massachusetts Bay, seeking to preserve their cultural identity and attain religious independence.[12] Plymouth's colonists faced great hardships and earned few profits for their investors, who sold their interests to the settlers in 1627.[13] Edward Winslow and William Bradford, two of its leaders, were likely authors of a work published in England in 1622 called Mourt's Relation. This book in some ways resembles a promotional tract intended to encourage further migration.[14] There were other short-lived colonial settlements in 1623 and 1624 at present-day Weymouth, Massachusetts; the Wessagusset Colony of Thomas Weston and an effort by Robert Gorges to establish an overarching colonial structure both failed.[15][16]\\r\\nIn 1623, the Plymouth Council for New England (successor to the Plymouth Company) established a small fishing village at Cape Ann under the supervision of the Dorchester Company, with Thomas Gardner as its overseer. This company was originally organized through the efforts of Puritan minister John White (1575ÿ1648) of Dorchester, in the English county of Dorset. White has been called \\"the father of the Massachusetts Colony\\" because of his influence in establishing this settlement and despite the fact that he never emigrated.[17] The Cape Ann settlement was not profitable, and the financial backers of the Dorchester Company terminated their support by the end of 1625. Their settlement was abandoned at present-day Gloucester, but a few settlers remained in the area, including Roger Conant, establishing a settlement a little further south, near the village of the Naumkeag tribe.[18]\\r\\nArchbishop William Laud was a favorite advisor of King Charles I and a dedicated Anglican, and he sought to suppress the religious practices of Puritans and other nonconforming beliefs in England. The persecution of many Puritans in the 1620s led them to believe that religious reform would not be possible while Charles was king, and many decided to seek a new life in the New World.[19]\\r\\nJohn White continued to seek funding for a colony. On 19 March 1627/8,[20] the Council for New England issued a land grant to a new group of investors that included a few holdovers from the Dorchester Company. The land grant was for territory between the Charles and Merrimack Rivers, including a three-mile (4.8?km) buffer to the north of the Merrimack and to the south of the Charles, that extended from \\"the Atlantick and westerne sea and ocean on the east parte, to the South sea on the west parte.\\"[21] The company to whom the grant was sold was styled \\"The New England Company for a Plantation in Massachusetts Bay\\".[22] The company elected Matthew Cradock as its first governor, and immediately began organizing provisions and recruiting settlers.\\r\\nThe company sent approximately 100 new settlers with provisions to join Conant in 1628, led by Governor's Assistant John Endecott, one of the grantees.[23] The next year, Naumkeag was renamed Salem and fortified by another 300 settlers, led by Rev. Francis Higginson, one of the first ministers of the settlement.[24] The first winters were difficult, with colonists struggling against starvation and disease, resulting in numerous deaths.[25][26]\\r\\nThe company leaders sought a Royal Charter for the colony because they were concerned about the legality of conflicting land claims given to several companies (including the New England Company) for the little-known territories of the New World, and because of the increasing number of Puritans who wanted to join the company. Charles granted the new charter on 4 March 1628/9,[27] superseding the land grant and establishing a legal basis for the new English colony at Massachusetts. It was not apparent whether Charles knew that the Company was meant to support the Puritan emigration, and he was likely left to assume that it was purely for business purposes, as was the custom. The charter omitted a significant clause: the location for the annual stockholders' meeting. Charles dissolved Parliament in 1629, whereupon the company's directors met to consider the possibility of moving the company's seat of governance to the colony. This was followed by the Cambridge Agreement later that year, in which a group of investors agreed to emigrate and work to buy out others who would not emigrate.\\r\\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony became the first English chartered colony whose board of governors did not reside in England. This independence helped the settlers to maintain their Puritan religious practices without interference from the king, Archbishop Laud, or the Anglican Church. The charter remained in force for 55 years; Charles II revoked it in 1684.[28] Parliament had passed legislation collectively called the Navigation Acts which attempted to prevent the colonists from trading with any nation other than England. Colonial resistance to those acts led King Charles to revoke the Massachusetts charter and consolidate all the colonies in New England, New York, and New Jersey into the Dominion of New England.\\r\\nA flotilla of ships sailed from England beginning in April 1630, sometimes known as the Winthrop Fleet. The fleet began arriving at Salem in June and carried more than 700 colonists, Governor John Winthrop, and the colonial charter.[29] Winthrop delivered his famous \\"City upon a Hill\\" sermon either before or during the voyage.[30]\\r\\nFor the next ten years, there was a steady exodus of Puritans from England, with about 20,000 people emigrating to Massachusetts and the neighboring colonies during the Great Migration.[31] Many ministers reacted to the repressive religious policies of England, making the trip with their congregations, among whom were John Cotton, Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and others. Religious divisions and the need for additional land prompted a number of new settlements that resulted in Connecticut Colony (by Hooker) and the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (by Williams and others). Minister John Wheelwright was banished in the wake of the Antinomian Controversy (like Anne Hutchinson), and he moved north to found Exeter, New Hampshire.\\r\\nThe advent of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in 1639 brought a halt to major migration, and a significant number of men returned to England to fight in the war. Massachusetts authorities were sympathetic to the Parliamentary cause and had generally positive relationships with the governments of the English Commonwealth and the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. The colony's economy began to diversify in the 1640s, as the fur trading, lumber, and fishing industries found markets in Europe and the West Indies, and the colony's shipbuilding industry developed. The growth of a generation of people who were born in the colony and the rise of a merchant class began to slowly change the political and cultural landscape of the colony, even though its governance continued to be dominated by relatively conservative Puritans.\\r\\nColonial support for the Commonwealth created tension after the throne was restored to Charles II in 1660. Charles sought to extend royal influence over the colonies, which Massachusetts resisted along with the other colonies. For example, the Massachusetts Bay colony repeatedly refused requests by Charles and his agents to allow the Church of England to become established, and the New England colonies in general resisted the Navigation Acts, laws that restricted colonial trade to England alone.\\r\\nAll of the New England colonies were ravaged by King Philip's War (1675ÿ76), when the Indians of southern New England rose up against the colonists and were decisively defeated, although at great cost in life to all concerned. The Massachusetts frontier was particularly hard hit, with several communities being abandoned in the Connecticut and Swift River valleys. By the end of the war, most of the Indian population of southern New England made peace treaties with the colonists.\\r\\nFollowing the English Restoration in 1660, matters of colonial administration drew the king's attention. Massachusetts in particular was reluctant to agree that the king had any sort of authority to control its governance.[32] This led to crises in the 1660s and late 1670s in which steps were first planned, and then executed in England to vacate the colonial charter. The Lords of Trade had decided for a variety of reasons to consolidate the New England colonies; they issued quo warranto writs in 1681 for the charters of several North American colonies, including Massachusetts.[33] The Massachusetts writ was never served for technical reasons, and the charter was not formally vacated until the chancery court issued a scire facias writ formally annulling the charter on June 18, 1684.[34] The proceedings were arranged so that the time had expired for the colonial authorities to defend the charter, before they even learned of the event.[35]\\r\\nFrom 1686, the colony's territory was administratively unified by James II of England with the other New England colonies in the Dominion of New England. The dominion was governed by Sir Edmund Andros without any local representation beyond hand-picked councillors, and was extremely unpopular in New England. Massachusetts authorities conspired to have Andros arrested in April 1689 after the 1688 Glorious Revolution in England, and they reestablished government under the forms of the vacated charter. However, dissenters from the Puritan rule argued that the government lacked a proper constitutional foundation, and some of its actions were resisted on that basis. The years from 1689 to 1692 were also difficult ones, since the colony was at the forefront of King William's War, and its frontier communities were ravaged by attacks organized in New France and conducted by French and Indian raiding parties.\\r\\nKing William III issued a charter in 1691, despite efforts by Massachusetts agents to revive the old colonial charter. It was chiefly negotiated by Increase Mather in his role as the colony's ambassador-extraordinary,[36] unifying Massachusetts Bay with Plymouth Colony, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and territories that roughly encompass present-day Maine, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay. This new charter additionally extended voting rights to non-Puritans, an outcome that Mather had tried to avoid.[37]\\r\\nLife could be quite difficult in the early years of the colony. Many colonists lived in fairly crude structures, including dugouts, wigwams, and dirt-floor huts made using wattle and daub construction. Construction improved in later years, and houses began to be sheathed in clapboard, with thatch or plank roofs and wooden chimneys.[38] Wealthier individuals would extend their house by adding a leanto on the back, which allowed a larger kitchen (possibly with a brick or stone chimney including an oven), additional rooms, and a sleeping loft. These houses were the precursors to what is now called the saltbox style of architecture.[39] Interiors became more elaborate in later years, with plaster walls, wainscoting, and potentially expensive turned woodwork in the most expensive homes.[40]\\r\\nColonists arriving after the first wave found that the early towns did not have room for them. Seeking land of their own, groups of families would petition the government for land on which to establish a new town; the government would typically allow the group's leaders to select the land. These grants were typically about 40 square miles (10,000?ha), and were located sufficiently near other towns to facilitate defense and social support. The group leaders would also be responsible for acquiring native title to the lands that they selected.[41] By this means, the colony expanded into the interior, spawning settlements in adjacent territories as well.[42]\\r\\nThe land within a town would be divided by communal agreement, usually allocating by methods that originated in England. Outside a town center, land would be allocated for farming, some of which might be held communally. Farmers with large plots of land might build a house near their properties on the outskirts of the town.[43] A town center that was well laid out would be fairly compact, with a tavern, school, possibly some small shops, and a meeting house that was used for civic and religious functions.[40] The meeting house would be the center of the town's political and religious life. Church services might be held for several hours on Wednesday and all day Sunday. Puritans did not observe annual holidays, especially Christmas, which they said had pagan roots. Annual town meetings would be held at the meeting house, generally in May, to elect the town's representatives to the general court and to transact other community business. Towns often had a village green, used for outdoor celebrations and activities such as military exercises of the town's trainband or militia.\\r\\nMany of the early colonists who migrated from England came with some or all of their family.[44] It was expected that individuals would marry fairly young and begin producing offspring. Infant mortality rates were comparatively low, as were instances of childhood death.[45] Men who lost their wives often remarried fairly quickly, especially if they had children needing care. Older widows would also sometimes marry for financial security. It was also normal for older widowed parents to live with one of their children. Due to the Puritan perception of marriage as a civil union, divorce did sometimes occur and could be pursued by both genders.[46]\\r\\nSexual activity was expected to be confined to marriage. Sex outside of marriage was considered fornication if neither partner was married, and adultery if one or both were married to someone else. Fornication was generally punished by fines and pressure to marry; a woman who gave birth to an illegitimate child could also be fined. Adultery and rape were more serious crimes, and both were punishable by death. Rape, however, required more than one witness, and was therefore rarely prosecuted. Sexual activity between men was called sodomy, and was also punishable by death.[47]\\r\\nWithin the marriage, the husband was typically responsible for supplying the family's financial needs, although it was not uncommon for women to work in the fields and to perform some sort of home labor (for example, spinning thread or weaving cloth) to supplement the family income. Women were almost exclusively responsible for seeing to the welfare of the children.\\r\\nChildren were baptized at the local meeting house within a week of being born. The mother was usually not present because she was still recovering from the birth, and the child's name was usually chosen by the father. Names were propagated within the family, and names would be reused when infants died. If an adult died without issue, his (or her) name could be carried on when the siblings of the deceased named children in his memory.\\r\\nMost children received some form of schooling, something which the colony's founders believed to be important for forming a proper relationship with God. Towns were obligated to provide education for their children, which was usually satisfied by hiring a teacher of some sort. The quality of these instructors varied, from minimally educated local people to Harvard-educated ministers.\\r\\nThe structure of the colonial government changed over the lifetime of the charter. The colonial charter was designed for the management of a corporation, and the needs of the colonial government did not always fit well into this model. The result was that the government began with a corporate organization that included a governor and deputy governor, a general court of its shareholders (known as \\"freemen\\"), and a council of assistants similar to a board of directors.[48] It ended with a governor and deputy governor, a bicameral legislature that included a representative lower house, and a body of freemen, a subset of the colony's adult inhabitants who were authorized to vote in elections. The council of assistants sat as the upper house of the legislature and served as the judicial court of last appeal.\\r\\nThe charter granted the general court the authority to elect officers and to make laws for the colony. Its first meeting in America was held in October 1630, but it was attended by only eight freemen.[48] They formed the first council of assistants, and voted (contrary to the terms of the charter) that the governor and deputy should be elected by them, from their number.[49] This was modified in the next session of the general court, in which the governor and deputy were to be elected by the general court.[50]\\r\\nAn additional 116 settlers were admitted to the general court as freemen in 1631, but most of the governing power, as well as the judicial power, remained with the council of assistants.[51] They also enacted a law specifying that only those men who \\"are members of some of the churches\\" in the colony were eligible to become freemen and gain the vote.[49] This restriction on the franchise was not liberalized until after the English Restoration.[50] The process by which individuals became members of one of the colony's churches involved a detailed questioning by the church elders of their beliefs and religious experiences; as a result, only individuals whose religious views accorded with those of the church leadership were likely to become members and gain the ability to vote in the colony.[52] After a protest over the imposition of taxes by a meeting of the council of assistants, the general court ordered each town to send two representatives, known as deputies, to meet with the court to discuss matters of taxation.[53]\\r\\nQuestions of governance and representation arose again in 1634, when several deputies demanded to see the charter, which the assistants had kept hidden from public view. The deputies learned of the provisions that the general court should make all laws, and that all freemen should be members of the general court. They then demanded that the charter be enforced to the letter, which Governor Winthrop pointed out was impractical given the growing number of freemen. The parties reached a compromise, and agreed that the general court would be made up of two deputies elected by each town.[53] The 1634 election resulted in the election of Dudley as governor, and the general court proceeded to reserve for itself a large number of powers, including those of taxation, distribution of land, and the admission of freemen.[54]\\r\\nThe transformation was complete: a trading company had become a (somewhat) representative democracy. A legal case in 1642 brought about the separation of the council of assistants into an upper house of the general court. The case involved a widow's lost pig and had been overturned by the general court; but the assistants had sat in judicial decision on the case and voted as a body to veto the general court's act.[55] The consequence of the ensuing debate was that the general court voted in 1644 that the council of assistants would sit and deliberate separately from the general court (they had sat together until then), the concurrence of both bodies being required for the passage of legislation. Judicial appeals were to be decided by a joint session, since otherwise the assistants would be in the position to veto attempts to overturn their own decisions.[56] A group of emigrants had bought all the Massachusetts Bay Company's stock and brought the Charter to America in 1630; neither the English king nor Parliament nor an English company exerted any influence in Massachusetts Bay Colony.[57] So it was in effect a self-ruling republic for some decades, also practicing separation of powers.\\r\\nIn 1641, the colony formally adopted its first code of laws, the Massachusetts Body of Liberties,[58] written or compiled by Nathaniel Ward.[59] This document consisted of 100 civil and criminal laws based upon the social sanctions recorded in the Bible.[60] These laws formed the nucleus of colonial legislation until independence, and contained some provisions that were later incorporated into the United States Constitution, such as the ideas of equal protection and double jeopardy.[59]\\r\\nOn the other hand, Massachusetts Bay was the first colony to legalize slavery with provision 91 of the Massachusetts Body of Liberties, which developed protections for people who were unable to perform public service.[61] Another law was developed to protect married women, children, and people with mental disabilities from making financial decisions.[61] Colonial law differentiated among types of mental disabilities, classifying them as \\"distracted persons,\\" \\"idiots,\\" and \\"lunaticks\\".[61] In 1693, poor laws enabled communities to use the estates of people with disabilities to defer the cost of community support of those individuals.[61][62][63] Many of these laws remained until the American Revolution.[61]\\r\\nMany behaviors were frowned upon culturally that modern sensibilities might consider relatively trivial actions, and some led to criminal prosecution. These included sleeping during church services, playing cards, and engaging in any number of activities on the Sabbath. Conversely, there were laws concerning behaviors that are still endorsed by popular sensibilities in 21st century America, such as smoking tobacco, abusing one's mother-in-law, profane dancing, and pulling hair.[64] Children, newcomers, and people with disabilities were exempt from punishment for such infractions.[61]\\r\\nThe colony's council of assistants sat as the final court of appeal and as the principal court for criminal issues of \\"life, limb, or banishment\\" and civil issues where the damages exceeded S100.[60] Lesser offenses were heard in county courts or by commissioners appointed for hearing minor disputes. The lower courts were also responsible for issuing licenses and for matters such as probate. Juries were authorized to decide questions of both fact and law, although the court was able to decide in the event that a jury failed to reach a decision.[65] Sentences for offenses included fines and corporal punishments such as whipping and sitting in the stocks, with the punishments of banishment from the colony and death by hanging being reserved for the most serious offenses.[66] Evidence was sometimes based on hearsay and superstition. For example, the \\"ordeal of touch\\" was used in 1646, in which someone accused of murder is forced to touch the dead body; if blood appears, the accused is deemed guilty. This was used to convict and execute a woman accused of murdering her newborn child.[67] Bodies of individuals hanged for piracy were sometimes gibbeted (publicly displayed) on harbor islands visible to seagoing vessels.[68]\\r\\nOne of the first people to be executed in the colony was Dorothy Talbye, who was apparently delusional. She was hanged in 1638 for murdering her daughter, as the common law of Massachusetts made no distinction at the time between insanity (or mental illness) and criminal behavior.[69] Midwife Margaret Jones was convicted of being a witch and hanged in 1648 after the condition of patients allegedly worsened in her care.[70]\\r\\nThe colonial leadership was the most active in New England in the persecution of Quakers. In 1660, one of the most notable instances was English Quaker Mary Dyer who was hanged in Boston for repeatedly defying a law banning Quakers from the colony.[71] Dyer was one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs. Executions ceased in 1661 when King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism.[72]\\r\\nIn 1643, Massachusetts Bay joined Plymouth Colony, Connecticut Colony, and New Haven Colony in the New England Confederation, a loose coalition organized primarily to coordinate military and administrative matters among the Puritan colonies.[73] It was most active in the 1670s during King Philip's War.[74] (New Hampshire had not yet been organized as a separate province, and both it and Rhode Island were excluded because they were not Puritan.)[75]\\r\\nIn the early years, the colony was highly dependent on the import of staples from England and was supported by the investments of a number of wealthy immigrants. Certain businesses were quick to thrive, notably shipbuilding, fisheries, and the fur and lumber trades. As early as 1632, ships built in the colony began trading with other colonies, England, and foreign ports in Europe. By 1660, the colony's merchant fleet was estimated at 200 ships and, by the end of the century, its shipyards were estimated to turn out several hundred ships annually.[76] In the early years, the fleet principally carried fish to destinations from the West Indies to Europe.[77] It was common for a merchant to ship dried fish to Portugal or Spain, pick up wine and oil for transport to England, and then carry finished goods from England or elsewhere back to the colony.[78] This and other patterns of trade became illegal following the introduction of the Navigation Acts in 1651, turning colonial merchants who continued these trading patterns into de facto smugglers. Many colonial authorities were merchants or were politically dependent on them, and they opposed being required by the crown to collect duties imposed by those acts.[79]\\r\\nThe fur trade only played a modest role in the colony's economy because its rivers did not connect its centers well with the Indians who engaged in fur trapping. Timber began to take on an increasingly important role in the economy, especially for naval purposes, after conflicts between England and the Dutch depleted England's supplies of ship masts.[80]\\r\\nThe colony's economy depended on the success of its trade, in part because its land was not as suitable for agriculture as that of other colonies such as Virginia, where large plantations could be established. The fishery was important enough that those involved in it were exempted from taxation and military service.[81] Larger communities supported craftsmen skilled in providing many of the necessities of 17th century life. Some income-producing activities took place in the home, such as carding, spinning, and weaving of wool and other fibers.[82]\\r\\nGoods were transported to local markets over roads that were sometimes little more than widened Indian trails.[83] Towns were required to maintain their roads, on penalty of fines, and the colony required special town commissions to lay out roads in a more sensible manner in 1639. Bridges were fairly uncommon, since they were expensive to maintain, and fines were imposed on their owners for the loss of life or goods if they failed. Consequently, most river crossings were made by ferry. Notable exceptions were a bridge across the Mystic River constructed in 1638, and another over the Saugus River, whose upkeep costs were subsidized by the colony.[84]\\r\\nThe colonial government attempted to regulate the economy in a number of ways. On several occasions, it passed laws regulating wages and prices of economically important goods and services, but most of these initiatives did not last very long.[85] The trades of shoe-making and coopering (barrel-making) were authorized to form guilds, making it possible to set price, quality, and expertise levels for their work. The colony set standards governing the use of weights and measures. For example, mill operators were required to weigh grain before and after milling, to ensure that the customer received back what he delivered (minus the miller's percentage).[86]\\r\\nThe Puritan dislike of ostentation led the colony to also regulate expenditures on what it perceived as luxury items. Items of personal adornment were frowned upon, such as lace and costly silk outerwear in particular. Attempts to ban these items failed, and the colony resorted to laws restricting their display to those who could demonstrate S200 in assets.[87]\\r\\nMost of the people who arrived during the first 12 years emigrated from two regions of England. Many of the colonists came from the county of Lincolnshire and East Anglia, northeast of London, and a large group also came from Devon, Somerset, and Dorset in the southwest of England. These areas provided the bulk of the migration, although colonists also came from other regions of England.[88] The pattern of migration often centered around specific Nonconformist clergy who sought to leave England under threat from Archbishop Laud, who encouraged their flock to accompany them.[89] One characteristic unique to the New England colonies (as distinguished from some of the other English colonies) was that most of the immigrants were emigrating for religious and political reasons, rather than economic ones.[90]\\r\\nThe preponderance of the immigrants were well-to-do gentry and skilled craftsmen. They brought with them apprentices and servants, the latter of whom were sometimes in indentured servitude.[91] Few titled nobility emigrated, even though some supported the emigration politically and financially and also acquired land holdings in Massachusetts and other colonies.[92] Merchants also represented a significant proportion of the migrants, often the children of the gentry, and they played an important role in establishing the economy of the colony.[91]\\r\\nWith the start of the English Civil War in 1642, emigration came to a comparative standstill, and some colonists even returned to England to fight for the Parliamentary cause. In the following years, most of the immigrants came for economic reasons; they were merchants, seamen, and skilled craftsmen. Following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the colony also saw in an influx of French Protestant Huguenots. During the period of the charter colony, small numbers of Scots immigrated, but these were assimilated into the colony.[93] The population of Massachusetts remained largely English in character until the 1840s.[94]\\r\\nSlavery existed but was not widespread within the colony. Some Indians captured in the Pequot War were enslaved, with those posing the greatest threat being transported to the West Indies and exchanged for goods and slaves.[95] Governor John Winthrop owned a few Indian slaves,[96] and Governor Simon Bradstreet owned two black slaves.[97] The Body of Liberties enacted in 1641 included rules governing the treatment and handling of slaves.[98] Bradstreet reported in 1680 that the colony had 100 to 120 slaves, but historian Hugh Thomas documents evidence suggesting that there may have been a somewhat larger number.[99]\\r\\nThe Massachusetts colony was dominated by its rivers and coastline. Major rivers included the Charles and Merrimack, as well as a portion of the Connecticut River, which has been used to transport furs and timbers to Long Island Sound. Cape Ann juts into the Gulf of Maine, providing harbors for fishermen plying the fishing banks to the east, and Boston's harbor provided secure anchorage for seagoing commercial vessels. Development in Maine was restricted to coastal areas, and large inland areas remained under native control until after King Philip's War, particularly the uplands in what is now Worcester County.\\r\\nThe colonial charter specified that the boundaries were to be from three miles (4.8?km) north of the Merrimack River to three miles south of the southernmost point of the Charles River and thence westward to the \\"South Sea\\" (i.e., the Pacific Ocean).[21] At the time, the course of neither of the rivers was known for any significant length, which eventually led to boundary disputes with the colony's neighbors.[100] The colony's claims were large, but the practicalities of the time meant that they never actually controlled any land further west than the Connecticut River valley. The colony also claimed additional lands by conquest and purchase, further extending the territory that it administered.\\r\\nThe southeastern boundary with the Plymouth Colony was first surveyed in 1639 and accepted by both colonies in 1640.[101] It is known in Massachusetts as the \\"Old Colony Line\\", and is still visible as the boundary between Norfolk County to the north and Bristol and Plymouth Counties to the south.[102]\\r\\nThe northern boundary was originally thought to be roughly parallel to the latitude of the mouth of the Merrimack River, since the river was assumed to flow primarily west. This was found not to be the case and, in 1652, Governor Endicott sent a survey party to locate the northernmost point on the Merrimack. At the point where the Pemigewasset River, the Merrimack's principal tributary, meets the Winnipesaukee River local Indians guided the party to the outlet of Lake Winnipesaukee, incorrectly claiming that as the Merrimack's source. The survey party carved lettering into a rock there (now called Endicott Rock), and its latitude was taken to be the colony's northern boundary. When extended eastward, this line was found to meet the Atlantic near Casco Bay in present-day Maine.\\r\\nFollowing this discovery, the colonial magistrates began proceedings to bring existing settlements under their authority in southern New Hampshire and Maine.[103] This extension of the colonial claim conflicted with several proprietary grants owned by the heirs of John Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges.[104] The Mason heirs pursued their claims in England, and the result was the formation of the Province of New Hampshire in 1679.[105] The current boundary between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was not fixed until 1741. In 1678, the colony purchased the claims of the Gorges heirs, gaining control over the territory between the Piscataqua and Kennebec Rivers.[106] The colony and later the province and state retained control of Maine until it was granted statehood in 1820.[107]\\r\\nThe colony performed a survey in 1642 to determine its southern boundary west to the Connecticut River.[108] This line, south of the present boundary, was protested by Connecticut, but stood until the 1690s, when Connecticut performed its own survey.[109] Most of today's Massachusetts boundaries with its neighbors were fixed in the 18th century.[110] The most significant exception was the eastern boundary with Rhode Island, which required extensive litigation, including Supreme Court rulings, before it was finally resolved in 1862.[111]\\r\\nLands which had previously belonged to the Pequots to the southwest were divided after the Pequot War in present-day Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut. Claims were disputed in this area for many years, particularly between Connecticut and Rhode Island.[112][113] Massachusetts administered Block Island and the area around present-day Stonington, Connecticut as part of these spoils of war,[114][115] and was one of several claimants to land in what was known as Narragansett Country (roughly Washington County, Rhode Island). Massachusetts lost all of these territories in the 1660s, when Connecticut and Rhode Island received their royal charters.[116][117]","input":"Who was banished from the massachusetts bay colony?"},{"output":"about 580 species and hybrids","context":"This is a list of the species of the genus Aloe. As of November?2016[update], the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepts about 580 species and hybrids.[1]","input":"How many species of aloe vera are there?"},{"output":"80,000 words","context":"A great number of words of French origin have entered the English language to the extent that many Latin words have come to the English language. According to different sources, 45% of all English words have a French origin.[1] This suggests that 80,000 words should appear in this list; this list, however, only includes words imported directly from French, such as both joy and joyous, and does not include derivatives formed in English of words borrowed from French, including joyful, joyfulness, partisanship, and parenthood. It also excludes both combinations of words of French origin with words whose origin is a language other than French??e. g.: ice cream, sunray, jellyfish, killjoy, lifeguard, and passageway?and English-made combinations of words of French origin??e. g.: grapefruit (grape + fruit), layperson (lay + person), mailorder, magpie, marketplace, surrender, petticoat, and straitjacket. This list also excludes words that come from French but were introduced into the English language via a language other than French, which include commodore, domineer, filibuster, ketone, loggia, lotto, mariachi, monsignor, oboe, paella, panzer, picayune, ranch, vendue, and veneer.\\r\\nAlthough French is mainly from Latin (which accounts for about 60% of English vocabulary either directly or via a Romance language), it also includes words from Gaulish and Germanic languages (especially Old Frankish). Since English is of Germanic origin, words that have entered English from the Germanic elements in French might not strike the eye as distinctively from French. Conversely, as Latin gave many derivatives to both the English and the French languages, ascertaining that a given Latinate derivative did not come to the English language via French can be difficult in a few cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the French vocabulary now appearing in English was imported over the centuries following the Norman Conquest of 1066, when England came under the administration of Norman-speaking peoples. William the Conqueror invaded the island of Britain, distributing lands and property to the Normans. As a result, French became the language of culture and the administration. The majority of the population of England continued to use their Anglo-Saxon language, but it was influenced by the language of the ruling elite, resulting in doublets. Consider for example the words for the meats eaten by the Anglo-Norman nobility and the corresponding animals raised by the Anglo-Saxon peasants: beef / ox, mutton / sheep, veal / calf, pork / pig, or pairs of words pertaining to different registers of language: commence / start, continue / go on, disengage / withdraw, encounter / meet, vend / sell, purchase / buy, commerce / trade. Words of French origin often refer to more abstract or elaborate notions than their Anglo-Saxon equivalents (e.g. liberty / freedom, justice / fairness), and are therefore of less frequent use in everyday language. This may not, however, be the case for all English words of French origin. Consider, for example: able, car, chair, city, country, fine, fruit, journey, juice, just, part, people, real, stay, table, travel, use, very, and wait.\\r\\nAfter the rise of Henry Plantagenet to the throne of England, other forms of dialectal French may have gained in influence to the detriment of Norman French (notably the variants of Anjou where the House of Plantagenet came from, and possibly Poitevin, the tongue of Eleanor of Aquitaine). With the English claim to the throne of France, the influence of the language in use at the royal court of France in Paris increased. The cultural influence of France remained strong in the following centuries and from the Renaissance onward borrowings were mainly made from Parisian French, which became the de facto standard language of France.\\r\\nNorman rule of England had a lasting impact on British society. Words from Anglo-Norman or Old French include terms related to Chivalry (homage, liege, peasant, government, seigniorage, suzerain, vassal, villain) and other institutions (bailiff, chancellor, council, government, mayor, minister, parliament), the organisation of religion (abbey, clergy, cloister, diocese, friar, mass, parish, prayer, preach, priest, sacristy, vestment, vestry, vicar), the nobility (baron, count, dame, duke, marquis, prince, sir), and the art of war (armour, baldric, dungeon, hauberk, mail, portcullis, rampart, surcoat). Many of these words related to the feudal system or medieval warfare have a Germanic origin (mainly through Old Frankish) (see also French words of Germanic origin).\\r\\nThe Norman origin of the British monarchy is still visible in expressions like Prince Regent, heir apparent, Princess Royal where the adjective is placed after the noun, like in French.\\r\\nThe vocabulary of heraldry has been heavily influenced by French (blazon, or, argent, sable, gules, passant), for more details see tinctures, attitudes, and charges of heraldry.\\r\\nSometimes used in heraldry, some mythological beasts (cockatrice, dragon, griffin, hippogriff, phoenix) or exotic animals (lion, leopard, antelope, gazelle, giraffe, camel, zebu, elephant, baboon, macaque, mouflon, dolphin, ocelot, ostrich, chameleon) draw their name from French. It is also the case of some animals native of Europe (via Anglo-Norman: eagle, buzzard, falcon, squirrel, coney, rabbit, leveret, lizard, marten, ferret, salmon, viper).\\r\\nThe vocabulary of warfare and the military include many words of French origin (battalion, dragoon, soldier, marine, grenadier, guard, officer, infantry, cavalry, army, artillery, corvette, musketeer, carabineer, pistol, fusilier, squad, squadron, platoon, brigade, corps, sortie, reconnaissance/reconnoitre, surrender, surveillance, rendezvous, espionage, volley, siege, terrain, troop, camouflage, logistics, matriel, accoutrements, bivouac, latrine, aide-de-camp, legionnaire, morale, esprit de corps, cordon sanitaire. See also military ranks: corporal, sergeant, lieutenant, captain, colonel, general, admiral. Many fencing terms are also from French.\\r\\nThe political/economic lexicon include many words of French origin like money, treasury, exchequer, commerce, finance, tax, liberalism, capitalism, materialism, nationalism, plebiscite, coup d'tat, regime, sovereignty, state, administration, federal, bureaucracy, constitution, jurisdiction, district.\\r\\nThe judicial lexicon has also been heavily influenced by French (justice, judge, jury, attorney, court, case).

It is also the case of some place names such as Canada, Arkansas, Michigan, Illinois, Maine, Vermont, Des Moines, Detroit, Chicago and Baton Rouge.\\r\\nSome words from Old French have been imported again from Middle French or Modern French, but have generally taken a more restrictive or specialised meaning the second time. Consider for instance?: chief / chef, luminary / luminaire, liquor / liqueur, castle / chateau, hostel / hotel, mask / masque, necessary / ncessaire, petty / petit, ticket / etiquette, troop / troupe, vanguard / avant-garde. Note that the word in French has kept the general meaning: e.g. chateau in French means castle and chef means chief. Even when not imported several times in different forms, loanwords from French generally have a more restrictive or specialised meaning than in French: e.g. legume (in Fr. lgume means vegetable), gateau (in Fr. gateau means cake).\\r\\nIn some cases, the English language has been more conservative than the French one with Old French words, at least in spelling if not in pronunciation: e.g. apostle (O.Fr. apostle / M.Fr. ap?tre), castle (O.Fr. castel or chastel / M.Fr. chateau), forest (O.Fr. forest / M.Fr. fort), vessel (O.Fr. vaissel / M.Fr. vaisseau). Other Old French words have even disappeared from Modern French: dandelion.\\r\\nOn the other hand, a move to restore the classical roots (Latin or Ancient Greek) occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Thus words from Old French saw their spelling re-Latinized. Although in most cases this did not affect their pronunciation (e.g. debt, doubt, indict, mayor), in some cases it did (e.g. abnormal, adventure, benefit). The ph transcription of words of Greek etymology was restored instead of the f. Thus fantosme became phantom, fesan became pheasant. This move occurred also in French, although less systematically (Old French farmacie became pharmacie (\\"pharmacy\\"), fenix became phnix (\\"phoenix\\"), but fantosme became fant?me (\\"phantom, ghost\\") and fesan became faisan (\\"pheasant\\").\\r\\nBeside re-Latinization that blurred the French origin of some words (e.g. peradventure), other modifications in spelling have included folk etymology alterations (see belfry, crayfish, gillyflower, gingerbread, penthouse, pickaxe).\\r\\nFurthermore, the spelling of some words was changed to keep the pronunciation as close to the original as possible (e.g. leaven), whereas in other cases the French spelling was kept and resulted in totally different pronunciation than French (e.g. leopard, levee). Terms that most recently entered the English language have kept French pronunciation and spelling (ambiance, aplomb, arbitrage, armoire, barrage, bonhomie, bourgeoisie, brochure, bureau, caf, camaraderie, catalogue, collage, critique, debris, dcor, dossier, lite, entourage, ennui, entrepreneur, espionage, expertise, expos, financier, garage, genre, glacier, intrigue, liaison, lingerie, machine, mirage, montage, panache, penchant, plaque, promenade, repertoire, sabotage, souvenir, terrain, tranche), though this may change with time (e.g. the initial h in hotel is not silent anymore, consider also the evolving pronunciation of herb, or garage). Expressions like femme fatale, bte noire and enfant terrible are still recognisably French.\\r\\nBorrowings are not a one-way process (See Reborrowing), some words of French origin ultimately come from Old English (Anglo-Saxon words)?: e.g.?: bateau, chiffon, gourmet. While conversely English words of French origin made their way \\"back\\" into Modern French?: budget, challenge, design, discount, fuel, gay, gin, humour, interview, jury, management, mess, pedigree, record, reporter, spleen, sport, squat, standard, suspense, tennis, ticket, toast, toboggan, tunnel, vintage.","input":"How many french words are there in the english language?"},{"output":"American English","context":"","input":"What is the most spoken language in the us?"},{"output":"Mont Blanc","context":"This page contains a table listing by elevation all 537 mountains of the Alps that exceed 3000 m and have a topographic prominence of at least 300 m. The list is continued down to 2500 m elevation on this page and down to 2000 m elevation on this page. All of these mountains are located in France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany or Slovenia. The list includes all 44 ultra-prominent peaks of the Alps, with 19 ultras over 3000m on this page.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme defines a summit in the Alps as independent, if the connecting ridge between it and a higher summit drops at least 30 m (a prominence/drop of 30 m, with the lowest point referred to as the \\"key col\\"). There are over 3300 such summits exceeding 2500 m in Switzerland alone.[1] In order for a peak to qualify as an independent mountain, traditionally a prominence of at least 300 m, or 10 times the aforementioned criterion value, has been used. Inclusion based on prominence is expedient for its objectivity and verifiability, but has its drawbacks. For example, an impressive mountain peak dominating a valley may be connected via long high ridges to a barely higher hidden summit. Among the better-known peaks absent from this list are Aiguille du Dru (due to Aiguille Verte), Dent du Gant (Grandes Jorasses), Mont Blanc de Cheilon (Ruinette), Nadelhorn and T?schhorn (Dom), Piz d'Err (Piz Calderas), Piz Badile (Piz Cengalo), Piz Pal (Piz Zupo), Similaun (Hintere Schwarze), Crozzon di Brenta (Cima Tosa), and Cimon della Pala (Cima Vezzana).\\r\\nAll mountain heights and prominences on the list are from the largest-scale maps available.[2] However, heights often conflict on different topographic maps, even when created by the same cartographic institution. For example, the Fletschhorn is indicated to be 3993, 3982, and 3984.5 m high on the 1:100,000, 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 Swisstopo map, respectively. The (rounded) elevation of the latter map is used in this table. Also, the deepest points in connecting ridges are not always survey points with spot elevations, where heights have to be estimated from contour lines. For example, maps often provide heights for the place where a route passes over a ridge rather than for the lowest point of that pass.\\r\\nFinally, many height indications on these maps are from quite old measurements, while glacier and firn melt has decreased the height of both peaks and key cols, sometimes quite dramatically. For example, in 1930, glacier-capped Cima Tosa was the highest mountain of the Brenta Dolomites at 3,173 m, but now is around 3,140 m high and some 10 m lower than its rocky neighbor Cima Brenta (3,151 m). Most maps and guides still report Cima Tosa's old height.[3] On the other hand, in the 1930s, when the current Italian 1:25.000 topographic map of the region was created, the Passo del Vannino, northwest of the Ofenhorn, was covered by the Lebendun glacier and was measured to be 2,754 m, while the much more recent Swisstopo map shows it to be bare and 2,717 m high. This is the key col for Corno di Ban (3,028 m), which, thanks to the retreat of the glacier, now appears on the list with a prominence of 311 m.\\r\\nGiven the inaccuracies, the list includes (unranked) summits with estimated prominences down to 7 meter below the cut-off (293 m), many of which may very well have a real prominence exceeding 300 m.\\r\\nThe lists contain 1599 mountains higher than 2000 m.[Note 1] The summits are distributed over 7 countries as follows:\\r\\n175 of the summits are on international borders. A number of mountains (e.g. Rocciamelone (IT), Aiguille de Tr la Tte (IT), Monte Rosa (CH), Piz Bernina (CH), and Hochgall (IT)) straddle borders as well, but have their summit on one side. In the list, only the exact location of the culminating point of the mountain is considered.\\r\\nThe 1092 mountains over 2500 m are found in 44 different administrative regions (cantons, departments, provinces, states). The administrative regions with the most mountains over 2500 m are Tyrol (161), Graubnden (148), Valais (103), South Tyrol (91), Sondrio (73), Aosta Valley (69), Savoy (67), Hautes-Alpes (66), Salzburg (57), Belluno (56) and Trentino (50).\\r\\nThe table below shows the distribution of mountains by height and prominence.

Thousands of cultivars have been registered by local and international Hemerocallis societies.[3] Hemerocallis is now placed in family Asphodelaceae, subfamily Hemerocallidoideae, but used to be part of Liliaceae (which includes true lilies).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDaylilies are perennial plants, whose name alludes to the flowers which typically last no more than 24 hours (about a day or so). The flowers of most species open in early morning and wither during the following night, possibly replaced by another one on the same scape (flower stalk) the next day. Some species are night-blooming. Daylilies are not commonly used as cut flowers for formal flower arranging, yet they make good cut flowers otherwise as new flowers continue to open on cut stems over several days.\\r\\nHemerocallis is native to Asia, primarily eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. This genus is popular worldwide because of the showy flowers and hardiness of many kinds. There are over 80,000 registered cultivars. Hundreds of cultivars have fragrant flowers, and more scented cultivars are appearing more frequently in northern hybridization programs. Some earlier blooming cultivars rebloom later in the season, particularly if their capsules, in which seeds are developing, are removed.\\r\\nMost kinds of daylilies occur as clumps, each of which has leaves, a crown, flowers, and roots. The long, linear lanceolate leaves are grouped into opposite fans with arching leaves. The crown is the small white portion between the leaves and the roots. Along the scape of some kinds of daylilies, small leafy \\"proliferations\\" form at nodes or in bracts. A proliferation forms roots when planted and is often an exact clone of its parent plant. Many kinds of daylilies have thickened roots in which they store food and water.\\r\\nA normal, single daylily flower has three petals and three sepals, collectively called tepals, each with a midrib in either the same basic color or a different color. The centermost part of the flower, called the throat, usually is of a different color than the more distal areas of the tepals. Each flower usually has six stamens, each with a two-lobed anther. After successful pollination, a flower forms a botanical capsule (often erroneously called a pod since botanical pods are found in Fabaceae, not Hemerocallis).\\r\\nThe Tawny or Fulvous Daylily (Hemerocallis fulva) is invasive in some parts of the United States, such as in Wisconsin (Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources).[4] People[who?] sometimes plant the Fulvous Daylily and other stoloniferous daylilies, which have underground runners. These kinds can overrun one's garden and can take an appreciable amount of time and effort to confine or remove.\\r\\nThe name Hemerocallis comes from the Greek words ??ϫ (hmera) \\"day\\" and ϫ?? (kalos) \\"beautiful\\".\\r\\nIn the Victorian language of flowers, the day lily symbolizes coquetry.[5]\\r\\nThe World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes 19 species as of September 2014[update]:[1]\\r\\nTwo hybrids are recognized:[1]\\r\\nA number of hybrid names appear in the horticultural literature but are not recognized as valid by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. These include:[1]\\r\\nThe daylily is often called[by whom?] \\"the perfect perennial\\", due to its brilliant colors, ability to tolerate drought and frost and to thrive in many different climate zones, and generally low maintenance. It is a vigorous perennial that lasts for many years in a garden, with very little care and adapts to many different soil and light conditions.[6] Daylilies have a relatively short blooming period, depending on the type. Some will bloom in early spring while others wait until the summer or even autumn. Most daylily plants bloom for 1 through 5 weeks, although some bloom twice in one season (\\"rebloomers)\\".[7]\\r\\nThe Tawny Daylily (Hemerocallis fulva), and the sweet-scented Lemon-lily (H. lilioasphodelus; H. flava, old name) were early imports from England to 17th-century American gardens and soon escaped from gardens. The introduced Tawny Daylily is now common in many natural areas, and some[who?] consider it a wildflower. Its nonscientific names include Railroad Daylily, Roadside Daylily, Ditch Lily, Outhouse Lily, Tiger Lily, and Wash-house Lily (although it is not a true lily). Some people[who?] have planted this species near outhouses and wash houses, hence two of its nonscientific names. Hemerocallis lilioasphodelus gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[8]\\r\\nThere are more than 80,000 daylily cultivars.[6] Depending on the species and cultivar, daylilies grow in USDA plant hardiness zones 1 through 11, making daylilies some of the more adaptable landscape plants. Hybridizers have developed the vast majority of cultivars within the last 100 years. The large-flowered, bright yellow Hemerocallis 'Hyperion', introduced in the 1920s, heralded a return to gardens of the once-dismissed daylily, and is still widely available in the nursery trade. Daylily breeding has been a specialty in the United States, where daylily heat- and drought-resistance made them garden standbys since the 1950s. New cultivars have sold for thousands of dollars, but many sturdy and prolific cultivars sell at reasonable prices of US$20 or less.\\r\\nHemerocallis is one of the very highly hybridized plant genera. Hybridizers register hundreds of new cultivars yearly. Hybridizers have extended the genus' color range from the yellow, orange, and pale pink of the species, through vibrant reds, purples, lavenders, greenish tones, near-black, near-white, and more. However, hybridizers have not yet been able to produce a daylily with primarily blue flowers in forms of blue such as azure blue, cobalt blue, and sky blue. Flowers of some cultivars have small areas of cobalt blue.\\r\\nOther flower traits that hybridizers developed include height, scent, ruffled edges, contrasting \\"eyes\\" in the center of a bloom, and an illusion of glitter which is called \\"diamond dust.\\" Sought-after improvements include foliage color and variegation and plant disease resistance and the ability to form large, neat clumps. Hybridizers also seek to make less-hardy plants hardier in Canada and the Northern United States by crossing evergreen and semi-evergreen plants with those that become dormant and by using other methods. Many kinds of daylilies form clumps of crowded shoots. People[who?] dig up such kinds every 3 or so years, separate shoots, and replant only some of the shoots to reduce crowding. This process increases the flowering of many cultivars.\\r\\nIn the last several decades, many hybridizers have focused on breeding tetraploid plants, which tend to have sturdier scapes and tepals than diploids and some flower-color traits that are not found in diploids. Until this trend took root, nearly all daylilies were diploid. \\"Tets,\\" as they are called by aficionados, have 44 chromosomes, while triploids have 33 chromosomes and diploids have 22 chromosomes per individual plant.[9] Hemerocallis fulva 'Europa', H. fulva 'Kwanso', H. fulva 'Kwanso Variegata', H. fulva 'Kwanso Kaempfer', H. fulva var. maculata, H. fulva var. angustifolia, and H. fulva 'Flore Pleno' are all triplods that almost never produce seeds and reproduce almost solely by underground runners (stolons) and dividing groups by gardeners. A polymerous daylily flower is one with more than three sepals and more than three petals. Although some people[who?] synonymize \\"polymerous\\" with \\"double,\\" some polymerous flowers have over five times the normal number of petals.\\r\\nFormerly daylilies were only available in yellow, pink, fulvous (bronzed), and rosy-fulvous colors, now they come in an assortment of many more color shades and tints thanks to intensive hybridization. They can now be found in nearly every color except pure blue and pure white. Those with yellow, pink, and other pastel flowers may require full sun to bring out all of their colors; darker varieties, including many of those with red and purple flowers are not colorfast in bright sun.\\r\\nThe highest award a cultivar can receive is the Stout Silver Medal, given in memory of Dr. Arlow Burdette Stout, who is considered to be the father of modern daylily breeding in North America.\\r\\nThis annual awardas voted by American Hemerocallis Society Garden judgescan be given only to a cultivar that has first received the Award of Merit not less than two years previously. The 2014 winner of the Stout Silver Medal is 'Webster's Pink Wonder', hybridized by Richard Webster and introduced by R. Cobb. A complete list of Stout Silver Medal winners can be seen on the AHS website.[10] The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's 2012 Award of Garden Merit:[11]\\r\\n'All American Chief'\\r\\n'Always Afternoon'\\r\\n'Arctic Snow'\\r\\n'Asterisk'\\r\\n'August Frost'\\r\\n'Beauty to Behold'\\r\\n'Burning Daylight'\\r\\n'Cat Dancer'\\r\\n'Cayenne'\\r\\n'Cherry Eyed Pumpkin'\\r\\ncitrina\\r\\n'Condilla'\\r\\n'Curly'\\r\\n'Cinnamon Windmill'\\r\\n'Custard Candy'\\r\\n'Eggplant Escapade'\\r\\n'Elegant Candy'\\r\\n'Fooled Me'\\r\\n'Grey Witch'\\r\\n'Holly Dancer'\\r\\n'Jamaican Me Crazy'\\r\\n'Jellyfish Jealousy'\\r\\n'Julie Newmar'\\r\\n'Karen's Curls'\\r\\n'Killer'\\r\\n'Lady Neva'\\r\\n'Lime Frost'\\r\\n'Mahogany Magic'\\r\\n'Mary's Gold'\\r\\n'Moonlit Masquerade'\\r\\n'North Wind Dancer'\\r\\n'Old Tangiers'\\r\\n'Performance Anxiety'\\r\\n'Primal Scream'\\r\\n'Radiant Moonbeam'\\r\\n'Ruby Spider'\\r\\n'Running Late'\\r\\n'Russian Rhapsody'\\r\\n'Selma Longlegs'\\r\\n'Serena Sunburst'\\r\\n'Sir Modred'\\r\\n'Spider Man'\\r\\n'Stafford'\\r\\n'Strawberry Candy'\\r\\nThe flowers of Hemerocallis citrina are edible and are used in Chinese cuisine.[12] They are sold (fresh or dried) in Asian markets as gum jum or golden needles (ߜ\` in Chinese; pinyin: jؐn zhn) or yellow flower vegetables (?S in Chinese; pinyin: hung hu ci).

Other Greek cities set up democracies, most following the Athenian model, but none are as well documented as Athens'.\\r\\nIt was a system of direct democracy, in which participating citizens voted directly on legislation and executive bills. Participation was not open to all residents: to vote one had to be an adult, male citizen i.e. neither a foreign resident, slave or a woman and the number of these \\"varied between 30,000 and 50,000 out of a total population of around 250,000 to 300,000\\" or \\"no more than 30 percent of the total adult population.\\"[1]\\r\\nThe longest-lasting democratic leader was Pericles. After his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolutions towards the end of the Peloponnesian War. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides; the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-century modification rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to a real democracy is debatable. Solon (594 BC), Cleisthenes (508/7 BC), and Ephialtes (462 BC) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy. Cleisthenes broke up the power of the nobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived rather than on their wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"democracy\\" (Greek: Ѵϫ?ϫ) combines the elements dmos (Ѵ??, which means \\"people\\", \\"neighbourhood\\", \\"district\\") and krtos (??, which means \\"force\\" or \\"power\\"), and thus means literally \\"people power\\". In the words \\"monarchy\\" and \\"oligarchy\\", the second element comes from arch (??), meaning \\"beginning (that which comes first)\\", and hence also \\"first place or power\\", \\"sovereignty\\". One might expect the term \\"demarchy\\" to have been adopted, by analogy, for the new form of government introduced by Athenian democrats. However, the word \\"demarchy\\" (Ѵϫ?ϫ) had already been taken and meant \\"mayoralty\\", the office or rank of a high municipal magistrate. (In present-day use, the term \\"demarchy\\" has acquired a new meaning.)\\r\\nWe are not certain that the word \\"democracy\\" was in existence when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted. The word is attested in Herodotus (Histories 6.43), who wrote some of the earliest surviving Greek prose, but this might not have been before 440 or 430 BC. Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name of 'Democrates',[2] a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty; the name can also be found in Aeolian Temnus.[3]\\r\\nAthens was not the only polis in Ancient Greece that instituted a democratic regime. Aristotle cites many other cities as well. \\"Yet, it is only with reference to Athens that we can attempt to trace some of specific sixth century events that led to the institution of democracy at the end of the century.\\"[4]\\r\\nBefore the first attempt at democratic government, Athens was ruled by a series of archons or chief magistrates, and the Areopagus, made up of ex-archons. The members of these institutions were generally aristocrats, who ruled the polis for their own advantage. In 621 BC Draco codified a set of \\"notoriously harsh\\" laws that were \\"a clear expression of the power of the aristocracy over everybody else.\\" This did not stop the aristocratic families feuding amongst themselves to obtain as much power as possible.[5]\\r\\nTherefore, by the 6th century BC, the majority of Athenians \\"had been 'enslaved' to the rich\\", and they called upon Plato's ancestor Solon, premier archon at the time, to liberate them and halt the feuding of the aristocracy. However, the \\"enfranchisement of the local laboring classes was succeeded by the development of chattel slavery, the enslavement of, in large part, foreigners.\\"[6]\\r\\nSolon, the mediator, reshaped the city \\"by absorbing the traditional aristocracy in a definition of citizenship which allotted a political function to every free resident of Attica. Athenians were not slaves but citizens, with the right, at the very least, to participate in the meetings of the assembly.\\" Under these reforms, the position of archon \\"was opened to all with certain property qualifications, and a Boule, a rival council of 400, was set up. The Areopagus, nevertheless, retained 'guardianship of the laws'\\".[7] A major contribution to democracy was Solon's setting up of an Ecclesia or Assembly, which was open to all male citizens. However, \\"one must bear in mind that its agenda was apparently set entirely by the Council of 400\\", \\"consisting of 100 members from each of the four tribes\\", that had taken \\"over many of the powers which the Areopagos had previously exercised.\\"[5]\\r\\nNot long afterwards, the nascent democracy was overthrown by the tyrant Peisistratos, but was reinstated after the expulsion of his son, Hippias, in 510. This sort of aristocratic takeover \\"was ended by the appeal by one contender, Cleisthenes, for the support of the populace.\\" The reforms of Cleisthenes in 508/7 undermined the domination of the aristocratic families and connected every Athenian to the city's rule. \\"Cleisthenes fixed the boundaries of the polis as a political rather than a geographical entity ÿ boundaries which Solon had left permeable ÿ by formally identifying the free inhabitants of Attica at that time as Athenian citizens.\\"[8] He did this by making the traditional tribes politically irrelevant and instituting ten new tribes, each made up of about three trytties, each consisting of several demes. \\"Every male citizen on reaching the age of 18 was now to be registered in his deme. It was this registration which confirmed his citizenship.\\"[9]\\r\\nA third set of reforms was instigated by Ephialtes in 462/1. While his opponents were away attempting to assist the Spartans, Ephialtes persuaded the Assembly to reduce the powers of the Areopagus: \\"in effect stripping it of all its controlling and supervisory powers and leaving it only as a court for cases of homicide and certain offences of sacrilege.\\" At the same time or soon afterwards, the membership of the Areopagus was extended to the lower level of the propertied citizenship.[10]\\r\\nIn the wake of Athens' disastrous defeat in the Sicilian campaign in 413 BCE, a group of citizens took steps to limit the radical democracy they thought was leading the city to ruin. Their efforts, initially conducted through constitutional channels, culminated in the establishment of an oligarchy, the Council of 400, in the Athenian coup of 411 BCE. The oligarchy endured for only four months before it was replaced by a more democratic government. Democratic regimes governed until Athens surrendered to Sparta in 404 BCE, when government was placed in the hands of the so-called Thirty Tyrants, pro-Spartan oligarchs.[11] After a year pro-democracy elements regained control, and democratic forms persisted until the Macedonian army of Phillip II conquered Athens in 338 BC.[12]\\r\\nAlexander the Great had led a coalition of the Greek states to war with Persia in 336 BC, but his Greek soldiers were hostages for the behavior of their states as much as allies. His relations with Athens were already strained when he returned to Babylon in 324 BC; after his death, Athens and Sparta led several Greek states to war with Macedon and lost.[13]\\r\\nThis led to the Hellenistic control of Athens, when the Macedonian king appointed a local agent as political governor in Athens. However, the governors, like Demetrius of Phalerum, appointed by Cassander, kept some of the traditional institutions in formal existence, although the Athenian public would consider them to be nothing more than Macedonian puppet dictators. Once Demetrius Poliorcetes ended Cassander's rule over Athens, Demetrius of Phalerum went into exile and the democracy was restored in 307 BC. However, by now Athens had become \\"politically impotent\\".[14] An example of this was that, in 307, in order to curry favour with Macedonia and Egypt, three new tribes were created, two in honour of the Macedonian king and his son, and the other in honour of the Egyptian king.\\r\\nHowever, when Rome fought Macedonia in 200, the Athenians abolished the first two new tribes and created a twelfth tribe in honour of the Pergamene king. The Athenians declared for Rome, and in 146 BC Athens became an autonomous civitas foederata. \\"Her independence was however little more than municipal, and, though the forms of the democracy survived, Rome?... strengthened the aristocratic elements in the constitution.\\"[15]\\r\\nUnder Roman rule, the archons ranked as the highest officials. They were elected, and even foreigners such as Domitian and Hadrian held the office as a mark of honour. Four presided over the judicial administration. The Council (whose numbers varied at different times from three hundred to seven hundred and fifty) was appointed by lot. It was superseded in importance by the Areopagus, which, recruited from the elected archons, had an aristocratic character and was entrusted with wide powers. From the time of Hadrian an imperial curator superintended the finances. The shadow of the old constitution lingered on and Archons and Areopagus survived the fall of the Roman Empire.[15]\\r\\nIn 88 BC, there was a revolution under the philosopher Athenion, who, as tyrant, forced the Assembly to agree to elect whomever he might ask to office. Athenion allied with Mithridates of Pontus, and went to war with Rome; he was killed during the war, and was replaced by Aristion. The victorious Roman general, Publius Cornelius Sulla, left the Athenians their lives and did not sell them into slavery; he also restored the previous government, in 86 BC.[16]\\r\\nAfter Rome became an Empire under Augustus, the nominal independence of Athens dissolved and its government converged to the normal type for a Roman municipality, with a Senate of decuriones.[17]\\r\\nEstimates of the population of ancient Athens vary. During the 4th century BC, there might well have been some 250,000ÿ300,000 people in Attica. Citizen families could have amounted to 100,000 people and out of these some 30,000 would have been the adult male citizens entitled to vote in the assembly. In the mid-5th century the number of adult male citizens was perhaps as high as 60,000, but this number fell precipitously during the Peloponnesian War.[18] This slump was permanent, due to the introduction of a stricter definition of citizen described below. From a modern perspective these figures may seem small, but among Greek city-states Athens was huge: most of the thousand or so Greek cities could only muster 1000ÿ1500 adult male citizens each; and Corinth, a major power, had at most 15,000.[19]\\r\\nThe non-citizen component of the population was made up of resident foreigners (metics) and slaves, with the latter perhaps somewhat more numerous. Around 338 BC the orator Hyperides (fragment 13) claimed that there were 150,000 slaves in Attica, but this figure is probably no more than an impression: slaves outnumbered those of citizen stock but did not swamp them.[20]\\r\\nOnly adult male Athenian citizens who had completed their military training as ephebes had the right to vote in Athens. The percentage of the population that actually participated in the government was 10% to 20% of the total number of inhabitants, but this varied from the fifth to the fourth century BC.[18] This excluded a majority of the population: slaves, freed slaves, children, women and metics (foreigners resident in Athens).[21] The women had limited rights and privileges, had restricted movement in public, and were very segregated from the men.[22]\\r\\nAlso excluded from voting were citizens whose rights were under suspension (typically for failure to pay a debt to the city: see atimia); for some Athenians this amounted to permanent (and in fact inheritable) disqualification. Given the exclusive and ancestral concept of citizenship held by Greek city-states, a relatively large portion of the population took part in the government of Athens and of other radical democracies like it, compared to oligarchies and aristocracies.[18]\\r\\nSome Athenian citizens were far more active than others, but the vast numbers required for the system to work testify to a breadth of direct participation among those eligible that greatly surpassed any present-day democracy.[18] Athenian citizens had to be descended from citizensafter the reforms of Pericles and Cimon in 450 BC, they \\"would be confined to those whose parents were both Athenian\\".[23] Although the legislation was not retrospective, five years later, when a free gift of grain had arrived from the Egyptian king, to be distributed among all citizens, \\"many 'illegitimates' were discovered\\" and removed from the registers.[24]\\r\\nCitizenship, \\"commonly applied not only to the individuals themselves but to their descendants as well\\", could be granted by the assembly, and was sometimes given to large groups (e.g. Plateans in 427 BC and Samians in 405 BC) but, by the 4th century, only to individuals and by a special vote with a quorum of 6000. This was generally done as a reward for some service to the state. In the course of a century, the number of citizenships so granted was in the hundreds rather than thousands.[25]\\r\\nThere were three political bodies where citizens gathered in numbers running into the hundreds or thousands. These are the assembly (in some cases with a quorum of 6000), the council of 500 (boule) and the courts (a minimum of 200 people, on some occasions up to 6000). Of these three bodies was is the assembly and the courts that were the true sites of power ÿ although courts, unlike the assembly, were never simply called the demos (the People) as they were manned by a subset of the citizen body, those over thirty. But crucially citizens voting in both were not subject to review and prosecution as were council members and all other officeholders.\\r\\nIn the 5th century BC we often hear of the assembly sitting as a court of judgment itself for trials of political importance and it is not a coincidence that 6000 is the number both for the full quorum for the assembly and for the annual pool from which jurors were picked for particular trials. By the mid-4th century however the assembly's judicial functions were largely curtailed, though it always kept a role in the initiation of various kinds of political trial.\\r\\nThe central events of the Athenian democracy were the meetings of the assembly (?ٰҿ?ϫ, ekklsia). Unlike a parliament, the assembly's members were not elected, but attended by right when they chose. Greek democracy created at Athens was direct, rather than representative: any adult male citizen over the age of 20 could take part,[26] and it was a duty to do so. The officials of the democracy were in part elected by the Assembly and in large part chosen by lottery in a process called sortition.\\r\\nThe assembly had four main functions: it made executive pronouncements (decrees, such as deciding to go to war or granting citizenship to a foreigner); it elected some officials; it legislated; and it tried political crimes. As the system evolved, the last function was shifted to the law courts. The standard format was that of speakers making speeches for and against a position followed by a general vote (usually by show of hands) of yes or no.\\r\\nThough there might be blocs of opinion, sometimes enduring, on important matters, there were no political parties and likewise no government or opposition (as in the Westminster system). Voting was by simple majority. In the 5th century at least there were scarcely any limits on the power exercised by the assembly. If the assembly broke the law, the only thing that might happen is that it would punish those who had made the proposal that it had agreed to. If a mistake had been made, from the assembly's viewpoint it could only be because it had been misled.[27]\\r\\nAs usual in ancient democracies, one had to physically attend a gathering in order to vote. Military service or simple distance prevented the exercise of citizenship. Voting was usually by show of hands (?ϫ, kheirotonia, \\"arm stretching\\") with officials judging the outcome by sight. This could cause problems when it became too dark to see properly. However, \\"any member of the Assembly could demand a recount\\".[28] For a small category of votes a quorum of 6000 was required, principally grants of citizenship, and here small coloured stones were used, white for yes and black for no. At the end of the session, each voter tossed one of these into a large clay jar which was afterwards cracked open for the counting of the ballots. Ostracism required the voters to scratch names onto pieces of broken pottery (?ϫϫ, ostraka), though this did not occur within the assembly as such.\\r\\nIn the 5th century BC, there were 10 fixed assembly meetings per year, one in each of the ten state months, with other meetings called as needed. In the following century the meetings were set to forty a year, with four in each state month. One of these was now called the main meeting, kyria ekklesia. Additional meetings might still be called, especially as up until 355 BC there were still political trials that were conducted in the assembly rather than in court. The assembly meetings did not occur at fixed intervals, as they had to avoid clashing with the annual festivals that followed the lunar calendar. There was also a tendency for the four meetings to be aggregated toward the end of each state month.[29]\\r\\nAttendance at the assembly was not always voluntary. In the 5th century public slaves forming a cordon with a red-stained rope herded citizens from the agora into the assembly meeting place (Pnyx), with a fine being imposed on those who got the red on their clothes.[30] After the restoration of the democracy in 403 BC, pay for assembly attendance was introduced. This promoted a new enthusiasm for assembly meetings. Only the first 6000 to arrive were admitted and paid, with the red rope now used to keep latecomers at bay.[31]\\r\\nIn 594 BC Solon is said to have created a boule of 400 to guide the work of the assembly.[32] After the reforms of Cleisthenes, the Athenian Boule was expanded to 500, and was elected by lot every year. Each of Cleisthenes's 10 tribes provided 50 councillors who were at least 30 years old.\\r\\nThe most important task of the Athenian Boule was to draft the deliberations (probouleumata) for discussion and approval in the Ecclesia. The Boule also directed finances, controlled the maintenance of the fleet and of the cavalry, judged the fitness of the magistrates-elect, received foreign ambassadors, advised the stratgoi (generals) in military matters, and could be given special powers by the Ecclesia in an emergency.[33]\\r\\nAccording to John Thorley, its membership was very carefully vetted. Cleisthenes restricted its membership, \\"to those of zeugitai status and above, probably arguing that these classes had a financial interest in good government\\". A member had to be approved by his deme, \\"and one can well imagine that demes were careful to select only those of known good sense who also had experience of local politics, and who were actually available to do the time-consuming job which demanded frequent attendance in Athens; and they probably favoured those who were well past 30\\".[34]\\r\\nThe members from each of the ten tribes in the Boule took it in turns to act as a standing committee (the prytaneis) of the Boule for a period of thirty-six days. All fifty members of the prytaneis on duty were housed and fed in the tholos of the Prytaneion, a building adjacent to the bouleuterion, where the boule met. \\"Each day one of their number was chosen by lot as chairman, and he was required to stay in the tholos for the twenty-four-hour period of his office. The chairman for the day presided over any meeting of the Boule held that day, and if there was a meeting of the Assembly that day?... he also presided over that\\".[35]\\r\\nThe boule also served as an executive committee for the assembly, and oversaw the activities of certain other magistrates. The boule coordinated the activities of the various boards and magistrates that carried out the administrative functions of Athens and provided from its own membership randomly selected boards of ten responsible for areas ranging from naval affairs to religious observances.[36] Altogether, the boule was responsible for a great portion of the administration of the state, but was granted relatively little latitude for initiative; the boule's control over policy was executed in its probouleutic, rather than its executive function; in the former, it prepared measures for deliberation by the assembly, in the latter, it merely executed the wishes of the assembly.[37]\\r\\nAthens had an elaborate legal system centered on full citizen rights (see atimia). The age limit of 30 or older, the same as that for office holders but ten years older than that required for participation in the assembly, gave the courts a certain standing in relation to the assembly. Jurors were required to be under oath, which was not required for attendance at the assembly. The authority exercised by the courts had the same basis as that of the assembly: both were regarded as expressing the direct will of the people. Unlike office holders (magistrates), who could be impeached and prosecuted for misconduct, the jurors could not be censured, for they, in effect, were the people and no authority could be higher than that. A corollary of this was that, at least acclaimed by defendants, if a court had made an unjust decision, it must have been because it had been misled by a litigant.[38]\\r\\nEssentially there were two grades of suit, a smaller kind known as dike (Ѵ?ٻ) or private suit, and a larger kind known as graphe or public suit. For private suits the minimum jury size was 200 (increased to 401 if a sum of over 1000 drachmas was at issue), for public suits 501. Under Cleisthenes' reforms, juries were selected by lot from a panel of 600 jurors, there being 600 jurors from each of the ten tribes of Athens, making a jury pool of 6000 in total.[39] For particularly important public suits the jury could be increased by adding in extra allotments of 500. 1000 and 1500 are regularly encountered as jury sizes and on at least one occasion, the first time a new kind of case was brought to court (see graph paran܇mn), all 6,000 members of the jury pool may have attended to one case.[40]\\r\\nThe cases were put by the litigants themselves in the form of an exchange of single speeches timed by a water clock or clepsydra, first prosecutor then defendant. In a public suit the litigants each had three hours to speak, much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). Decisions were made by voting without any time set aside for deliberation. Jurors did talk informally amongst themselves during the voting procedure and juries could be rowdy, shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants. This may have had some role in building a consensus. The jury could only cast a 'yes' or 'no' vote as to the guilt and sentence of the defendant. For private suits only the victims or their families could prosecute, while for public suits anyone (ho boulomenos, 'whoever wants to' i.e. any citizen with full citizen rights) could bring a case since the issues in these major suits were regarded as affecting the community as a whole.\\r\\nJustice was rapid: a case could last no longer than one day and \\"completed by sunset\\".[41] Some convictions triggered an automatic penalty, but where this was not the case the two litigants each proposed a penalty for the convicted defendant and the jury chose between them in a further vote.[42] No appeal was possible. There was however a mechanism for prosecuting the witnesses of a successful prosecutor, which it appears could lead to the undoing of the earlier verdict.\\r\\nPayment for jurors was introduced around 462 BC and is ascribed to Pericles, a feature described by Aristotle as fundamental to radical democracy (Politics 1294a37). Pay was raised from 2 to 3 obols by Cleon early in the Peloponnesian war and there it stayed; the original amount is not known. Notably, this was introduced more than fifty years before payment for attendance at assembly meetings. Running the courts was one of the major expenses of the Athenian state and there were moments of financial crisis in the 4th century when the courts, at least for private suits, had to be suspended.[43]\\r\\nThe system showed a marked anti-professionalism. No judges presided over the courts nor did anyone give legal direction to the jurors; magistrates had only an administrative function and were laymen. Most of the annual magistracies at Athens could only be held once in a lifetime. There were no lawyers as such; litigants acted solely in their capacity as citizens. Whatever professionalism there was tended to disguise itself; it was possible to pay for the services of a speechwriter or logographer (logographos), but this may not have been advertised in court. Probably jurors would be more impressed if it seemed as though the litigant were speaking for themselves.[44]\\r\\nAs the system evolved, the courts (that is, citizens under another guise) intruded upon the power of the assembly. From 355 BC political trials were no longer held in the assembly, but only in a court. In 416 BC the graph paran܇mn (\\"indictment against measures contrary to the laws\\") was introduced. Under this, anything passed by the assembly or even proposed but not yet voted on, could be put on hold for review before a jury ÿ which might annul it and perhaps punish the proposer as well.\\r\\nRemarkably, it seems that a measure blocked before the assembly voted on it did not need to go back to the assembly if it survived the court challenge: the court was enough to validate it. Once again it is important to bear in mind the lack of 'neutral' state intervention. To give a schematic scenario by way of illustration: two men have clashed in the assembly about a proposal put by one of them; it passed, and now the two of them go to court with the loser in the assembly prosecuting both the law and its proposer. The quantity of these suits was enormous: in effect the courts became a kind of upper house.\\r\\nIn the 5th century there was in effect no procedural difference between an executive decree and a law: they were both simply passed by the assembly. But from 403 BC they were set sharply apart. Henceforth laws were made not in the assembly, but by special panels of citizens drawn from the annual jury pool of 6000. They were known as the nomothetai (Ĳ?ϫ), the lawmakers.[45]\\r\\nThe institutions sketched above ÿ assembly, officeholders, council, courts ÿ are incomplete without the figure that drove the whole system, Ho boulomenos, he who wishes, or anyone who wishes. This expression encapsulated the right of citizens to take the initiative: to stand to speak in the assembly, to initiate a public lawsuit (that is, one held to affect the political community as a whole), to propose a law before the lawmakers or to approach the council with suggestions. Unlike officeholders, the citizen initiator was not voted before taking up office or automatically reviewed after stepping down  it had after all no set tenure and might be an action lasting only a moment. But any stepping forward into the democratic limelight was risky and if someone chose (another citizen initiator) they could be called to account for their actions and punished. There were also other terms used for \\"the persons who pleaded in public actions and those who had initiated private suits. Although the expression ho diokon (literally 'the one who pursues') was applied to the initiators of both public and private actions, the designations kategoros ('accuser')?... were used only of prosecutors in public actions and in the actions for homicide heard by the Areiopagos and other homicide courts.\\"[46]\\r\\nJust before the reforms of Solon in the 7th century BC, Athens was governed by a few archons (three rising to nine) and the council of the Areopagus \\"(appointed by the powerful noble families from their own members)\\". There also seems to have been a type of citizen assembly, presumably of the hoplite class. However, \\"There seems little doubt that it was the arkhons, with the advice of the Areopagos, who really ran the state.\\" The mass of people had no say in government at all.[47]\\r\\nSolon's reforms allowed the archons to come from some of the higher propertied classes and not only from the aristocratic families. Since the Areopagus was made up of ex-archons, this would eventually mean the weakening of the hold of the nobles there as well. However, even with Solon's creation of the citizen's assembly, the Archons and Areopagus still wielded a great deal of power.[48]\\r\\nThe reforms of Cleisthenes meant that the archons were elected by the Assembly, but were still selected from the upper classes.[49] The Areopagus kept its power as 'Guardian of the Laws', \\"which probably gave the Areopagos the power to intervene and to apply a veto if the Council of 500 or the Assembly or any magistrate acted or proposed to act 'unconstitutionally'\\", however this worked in practice.[50]\\r\\nEphialtes, and later Pericles, reduced the power of the Areopagus dramatically. The Assembly \\"passed a measure to limit the powers of the Areopagos, in effect stripping it of all its controlling and supervisory powers.\\" In the play The Eumenides, performed in 458, Aeschylus, himself a noble, portrays the Areopagus as a court established by Athena herself. It appears that Aeschylus \\"is trying to preserve the dignity of a severely battered institution.\\"[10]\\r\\nApproximately 1100 citizens (including the members of the council of 500) held office each year. They were mostly chosen by lot, with a much smaller (and more prestigious) group of about 100 elected. Neither was compulsory; individuals had to nominate themselves for both selection methods. In particular, those chosen by lot were citizens acting without particular expertise. This was almost inevitable since, with the notable exception of the generals (strategoi), each office could be held by the same person only once. For example, \\"The same person could not be a member of the Boule in two consecutive years, and could only be a member twice in a lifetime.\\"[51]\\r\\nPart of the ethos of democracy, however, was the building of general competence by ongoing involvement. In the 5th century version of the democracy, the ten annually elected generals were often very prominent, but for those who had power, it lay primarily in their frequent speeches and in the respect accorded them in the assembly, rather than their vested powers.\\r\\nWhile citizens voting in the assembly were the people and so were free of review or punishment, those same citizens when holding an office served the people and could be punished very severely. All of them were subject to a review beforehand that might disqualify them for office and an examination after stepping down. Officeholders were the agents of the people, not their representatives. Citizens active as office holders served in a quite different capacity from when they voted in the assembly or served as jurors.\\r\\nThe assembly and the courts were regarded as the instantiation of the people of Athens: they were the people, no power was above them and they could not be reviewed, impeached or punished. However, when an Athenian took up an office, he was regarded as 'serving' the people. As such, he could be regarded as failing in his duty and be punished for it.\\r\\nThere were in fact some limitations on who could hold office. Age restrictions were in place with thirty years as a minimum, rendering about a third of the adult citizen body ineligible at any one time. An unknown proportion of citizens were also subject to disenfranchisement (atimia), excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily (depending on the type). Furthermore, all citizens selected were reviewed before taking up office (dokimasia) at which they might be disqualified.\\r\\nCompetence does not seem to have been the main issue, but rather, at least in the 4th century BC, whether they were loyal democrats or had oligarchic tendencies. However, magistrates, after leaving office were subject to a scrutiny (euthunai, literally 'straightenings' or 'submission of accounts') to review their performance. Both of these processes were in most cases brief and formulaic, but they opened up in the possibility, if some citizen wanted to take some matter up, of a contest before a jury court.[52]\\r\\nIn the case of a scrutiny going to trial, there was the risk for the former officeholder of suffering severe penalties. Finally, even during his period of office, any officeholder could be impeached and removed from office by the assembly. In each of the ten \\"main meetings\\" (kuriai ekklesiai) a year, the question was explicitly raised in the assembly agenda: were the office holders carrying out their duties correctly?\\r\\nBy and large the power exercised by these officials was routine administration and quite limited. The powers of officials were precisely defined and their capacity for initiative limited. They administered rather than governed. When it came to penal sanctions, no officeholder could impose a fine over fifty drachmas. Anything higher had to go before a court.\\r\\nThe use of a lottery to select officeholders was regarded as the most democratic means: elections would favour those who were rich, noble, eloquent and well-known, while allotment spread the work of administration throughout the whole citizen body, engaging them in the crucial democratic experience of, to use Aristotle's words, \\"ruling and being ruled in turn\\" (Politics 1317b28ÿ30). The allotment of an individual was based on citizenship rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which could be bought. Allotment therefore was seen as a means to prevent the corrupt purchase of votes and it gave citizens a unique form of political equality as all had an equal chance of obtaining government office. Samons writes that \\"the system of selection by lottery for members of the Council of 500 and other officials (like the treasurers of the sacred funds) provided a potentially significant check on the dangers of demagoguery.\\" However, this may not have been completely successful, as some \\"increasingly pandered to the electorate and?... often told the people only what they wanted to hear.\\"[53]\\r\\nThe random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be competent has obvious risks, but the system included features meant to obviate possible problems. Athenians selected for office served as teams (boards, panels). In a group someone will know the right way to do things and those that do not may learn from those that do. During the period of holding a particular office everyone on the team is observing everybody else. There were however officials such as the nine archons, who while seemingly a board carried out very different functions from each other.\\r\\nNo office appointed by lot could be held twice by the same individual. The only exception was the boule or council of 500. In this case, simply by demographic necessity, an individual could serve twice in a lifetime. This principle extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as assistants to magistrates such as the archons. To the Athenians it seems what had to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use office as a way of accumulating ongoing power.[54]\\r\\nDuring an Athenian election, approximately one hundred officials out of a thousand were elected rather than chosen by lot. There were two main categories in this group: those required to handle large sums of money, and the 10 generals, the strategoi. One reason that financial officials were elected was that any money embezzled could be recovered from their estates; election in general strongly favoured the rich, but in this case wealth was virtually a prerequisite.\\r\\nGenerals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge but also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the wider Greek world where wars were fought. In the 5th century BC, principally as seen through the figure of Pericles, the generals could be among the most powerful people in the pols. Yet in the case of Pericles, it is wrong to see his power as coming from his long series of annual generalships (each year along with nine others). His office holding was rather an expression and a result of the influence he wielded. That influence was based on his relation with the assembly, a relation that in the first instance lay simply in the right of any citizen to stand and speak before the people. Under the 4th century version of democracy the roles of general and of key political speaker in the assembly tended to be filled by different persons. In part this was a consequence of the increasingly specialized forms of warfare practiced in the later period.\\r\\nElected officials too were subject to review before holding office and scrutiny after office. And they too could be removed from office at any time that the assembly met. There was also a death penalty for \\"inadequate performance\\" while in office.[55]\\r\\nA good example of the contempt the first democrats felt for those who did not participate in politics can be found in the modern word 'idiot', which finds its origins in the ancient Greek word ?Ѵ??, idits, meaning a private person, a person who is not actively interested in politics;[56] such characters were talked about with contempt, and the word eventually acquired its modern meaning. According to Thucydides, Pericles may have declared in a funeral oration:\\r\\nWe do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all.[57]\\r\\nAlthough, under Athenian democracy, voters were allowed the same opportunity to voice their opinion and to sway the discussion, they were not always successful, and, often, the minority was forced to vote in favor of a motion that they did not agree with.[58]\\r\\nAthenian democracy has had many critics, both ancient and modern. Ancient Greek critics of the democracy include Thucydides the general and historian, Aristophanes the playwright, Plato the pupil of Socrates, Aristotle the pupil of Plato, and a writer known as the Old Oligarch. Modern critics are more likely to find fault with the narrow definition of the citizen body, but in the ancient world the complaint, if anything, went in the opposite direction. For them, the common people were not necessarily the right people to rule and made huge mistakes. According to Samons:\\r\\nThe modern desire to look to Athens for lessons or encouragement for modern thought, government, or society must confront this strange paradox: the people that gave rise to and practiced ancient democracy left us almost nothing but criticism of this form of regime (on a philosophical or theoretical level). And what is more, the actual history of Athens in the period of its democratic government is marked by numerous failures, mistakes, and misdeedsmost infamously, the execution of Socratesthat would seem to discredit the ubiquitous modern idea that democracy leads to good government.[59]\\r\\nThucydides, from his Aristocratic and historical viewpoint, reasoned that the common people were often much too credulous about even contemporary facts to rule justly. Josiah Ober notes that \\"Thucydides cites examples of two errors regarding Sparta: the beliefs that the two Spartan kings each had two votes in council and that there was a Spartan battalion called the 'Pitanate lochos.' Thucydides sums up: 'Such is the degree of carelessness among the many (hoi polloi) in the search for truth (aletheia) and their preference for ready-made accounts'.\\" He contrasted his own critical-historical approach to history with the way the demos decided upon the truth. So \\"Thucydides has established for his reader the existence of a potentially fatal structural flaw in the edifice of democratic ways of knowing and doing. The identification of this \\"flaw\\" is a key to his criticism of Athenian popular rule.\\"[60]\\r\\nAlso, Donald Kagan writes that \\"In the fourth century, Plato and Aristotle must have been repeating old complaints when they pointed out the unfairness of democracy: 'it distributes a sort of equality to equal and unequal alike'.\\"[61] Instead of seeing it as a fair system under which 'everyone' has equal rights, the critics saw it as the numerically preponderant poor tyrannizing the rich. They regarded this as manifestly unjust. In Aristotle this is categorized as the difference between 'arithmetic' and 'geometric' (i.e. proportional) equality.\\r\\nTo its ancient detractors rule by the demos was also reckless and arbitrary. Two examples demonstrate this:\\r\\nWhile Plato blamed democracy for killing Socrates, his criticisms of the rule of the demos were much more extensive. Much of his writings were about his alternatives to democracy. His The Republic, The Statesman and Laws contained many arguments against democratic rule and in favour of a much narrower form of government: \\"The organization of the city must be confided to those who possess knowledge, who alone can enable their fellow-citizens to attain virtue, and therefore excellence, by means of education.\\"[64]\\r\\nWhether the democratic failures should be seen as systemic, or as a product of the extreme conditions of the Peloponnesian war, there does seem to have been a move toward correction. A new version of democracy was established from 403 BC, but it can be linked with both earlier and subsequent reforms (graph paran܇mn 416 BC; end of assembly trials 355 BC). For instance, the system of nomothesia was introduced. In this:\\r\\nA new law might be proposed by any citizen. Any proposal to modify an existing law had to be accompanied by a proposed replacement law. The citizen making the proposal had to publish it [in] advance: publication consisted of writing the proposal on a whitened board located next to the statues of the Eponymous Heroes in the agora. The proposal would be considered by the Council, and would be placed on the agenda of the Assembly in the form of a motion. If the Assembly voted in favor of the proposed change, the proposal would be referred for further consideration by a group of citizens called nomothetai (literally \\"establishers of the law\\").[18]\\r\\nIncreasingly, responsibility was shifted from the assembly to the courts, with laws being made by jurors and all assembly decisions becoming reviewable by courts. That is to say, the mass meeting of all citizens lost some ground to gatherings of a thousand or so which were under oath, and with more time to focus on just one matter (though never more than a day). One downside was that the new democracy was less capable of rapid response.\\r\\nAnother tack of criticism is to notice the disquieting links between democracy and a number of less than appealing features of Athenian life. Although democracy predated Athenian imperialism by over thirty years, they are sometimes associated with each other. For much of the 5th century at least democracy fed off an empire of subject states. Thucydides the son of Milesias (not the historian), an aristocrat, stood in opposition to these policies, for which he was ostracised in 443 BC.\\r\\nAt times the imperialist democracy acted with extreme brutality, as in the decision to execute the entire male population of Melos and sell off its women and children simply for refusing to become subjects of Athens. The common people were numerically dominant in the navy, which they used to pursue their own interests in the form of work as rowers and in the hundreds of overseas administrative positions. Further they used the income from empire to fund payment for officeholding. This is the position set out by the anti-democratic pamphlet known whose anonymous author is often called the Old Oligarch. This writer (also called pseudo-Xenophon) produced several comments critical of democracy, such as:\\r\\n1. Democracy is not the rule of the demos qua citizenship in the interest of the entire polis, but the self-interested rule of a sociological faction. 2. The collectivization of political responsibility for decisions and agreements in a democracy leads to dishonesty and the tendency to scapegoat individual speakers or magistrates. 3. Because it is an integrated system, democracy seems incapable of internal amelioration, yet because of its inclusivist tendencies, especially in regard to citizenship, it coopts its natural enemies and so generates few active opponents. 4. There is a strong relationship between a democracy's domestic and foreign policies; a rational imperial democracy will be likely to foment democracy among its subjects. 5. Democracy depends on naval power; naval power in turn depends on the control of capital resources; ergo a democracy will tend to be aggressively acquisitive. 6. Democracy's core values of freedom and equality are not exclusive to the citizen population; noncitizens are also treated more equitably than is seemly. 7. Democracy tends to blur the distinction between nature and political culture, thereby blinding elites to their own best interests and luring them into immorality.[65]\\r\\nAristotle also wrote about what he considered to be a better form of government than democracy. Rather than any citizen partaking with equal share in the rule, he thought that \\"Virtue understood as embracing courage and temperance and prudence as well as justice turns out to be the chief determinant for shares in rule. Those who are superior in virtue should receive greater shares in rule.\\"[66]\\r\\nA case can be made that discriminatory lines came to be drawn more sharply under Athenian democracy than before or elsewhere, in particular in relation to women and slaves, as well as in the line between citizens and non-citizens. By so strongly validating one role, that of the male citizen, it has been argued that democracy compromised the status of those who did not share it.\\r\\nSince the 19th century, the Athenian version of democracy has been seen by one group as a goal yet to be achieved by modern societies. They want representative democracy to be added to or even replaced by direct democracy in the Athenian way, perhaps by utilizing electronic democracy. Another group, on the other hand, considers that, since many Athenians were not allowed to participate in its government, Athenian democracy was not a democracy at all. \\"[C]omparisons with Athens will continue to be made as long as societies keep striving to realize democracy under modern conditions and their successes and failures are discussed.\\"[70]\\r\\nSince the middle of the 20th century, most countries have claimed to be a democracy, regardless of the actual makeup of its government. Yet, after the demise of Athenian democracy, few looked upon it as a good form of government. This was because no legitimation of that rule was formulated to counter the negative accounts of Plato and Aristotle. They saw it as the rule of the poor that plundered the rich, and so democracy was viewed as a sort of \\"collective tyranny\\". \\"Well into the 18th century democracy was consistently condemned.\\" Sometimes, mixed constitutions evolved with a democratic element, but \\"it definitely did not mean self-rule by citizens.\\"[71]\\r\\nIn the age of Cicero and Caesar, Rome was a republic, but not a democracy. Furthermore, it would be misleading to say that the tradition of Athenian democracy was an important part of the 18th-century revolutionaries' intellectual background. The classical example that inspired the American and French revolutionaries as well as the English radicals was Rome rather than Greece. Thus, the Founding Fathers who met in Philadelphia in 1787, did not set up a Council of the Areopagos, but a Senate, that, eventually, met on the Capitol.[72] Following Rousseau (1712ÿ1778), \\"democracy came to be associated with popular sovereignty instead of popular participation in the exercise of power.\\"\\r\\nSeveral German philosophers and poets took delight in the fullness of life in Athens, and not long afterwards \\"the English liberals put forward a new argument in favor of the Athenians\\". In opposition, thinkers such as Samuel Johnson were worried about the ignorance of a democratic decision-making body. However, \\"Macaulay and John Stuart Mill and George Grote saw the great strength of the Athenian democracy in the high level of cultivation that citizens enjoyed and called for improvements in the educational system of Britain that would make possible a shared civic consciousness parallel to that achieved by the ancient Athenians.\\"[73]\\r\\nTherefore, it was George Grote, in his History of Greece (1846ÿ1856), who would claim that \\"Athenian democracy was neither the tyranny of the poor, nor the rule of the mob.\\" He argued that only by giving every citizen the vote would people ensure that the state would be run in the general interest. Later, to the end of World War Il, democracy became dissociated from its ancient frame of reference. It was not anymore only one of the many possible ways in which political rule could be organised in a polity: it became the only possible political system in an egalitarian society.
