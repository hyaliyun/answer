Data based on incomes published in 2016 by Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) show that, after housing costs have been taken into consideration, the number of people living in the UK in relative poverty to be 13.44m (21% of the population)[1] In 2015, a report by Institute for Fiscal Studies reported that 21.6% of Britons were now in relative poverty. The report showed that there had been a fall in poverty in the first few years of the twenty-first century, but the rate of poverty had remained broadly flat since 2004/5.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been found by the Poverty and Social Exclusion project at Bristol University in 2014,[3] that the proportion of households lacking three items or activities deemed necessary for life in the UK at that time (as defined by a survey of the wider population) has increased from 14% in 1983 to 33% in 2012.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the 19th century more than 25% of the population was living at or below the subsistence level due to low wages.[7] Only 75 per cent of population had enough money to access to food, clothes, rent and fuel.[7] In 1900, millions of population lived in terrible conditions such as damp and badly built houses.[8] At the same time, overcrowding led to the spread of disease. Things greatly improved after the First World War, and although poverty had not completely disappeared by the 1930s, it was much less than ever before.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1950s, it was believed by numerous people that poverty had been all but abolished from Britain, with only a few isolated pockets of deprivation still remaining.[9] Much of this assumption was derived from a 1951 study which showed that in 1950 only 1.5% of the survey population lived in poverty, compared with 18% in 1936 when a previous study had been conducted in that town by Rowntree.[who?] A leader in The Times spoke positively of this 'remarkable improvement ÿ no less than the virtual abolition of the sheerest want.'[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the course of the 1950s and 1960s, however, a \\"rediscovery\\" of poverty took place, with various surveys showing that a substantial proportion of Britons were impoverished, with between 4% and 12% of the population estimated to be living below the Supplementary Benefits scales. In 1969, Professor A. Atkinson stated that \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to this definition, between 2-5 million Britons were trapped in poverty. In addition, some 2.6 million people were in receipt of Supplementary Benefits and therefore living on the poverty line. This meant that at least 10% of the population were in poverty at his time. Bad housing conditions also constituted a major cause of poverty in the postwar era. In the early Sixties, it was estimated that three million families lived in \\"slums, near slums on grossly overcrowded conditions,\\" while a 1967 housing survey of England and Wales found that 11.7% of all dwellings were unfit.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their 1965 study on poverty, \\"The Poor and the Poorest,\\" Professors Peter Townsend and Brian Abel-Smith decided to measure poverty on the basis of the National Assistance levels of living and estimated that some 14% (around 7.5 million) of Britons lived in poverty.[9] Townsend and Abel-Smith also estimated that since the mid-1950s the percentage of the population living in poverty had risen from 8% to 14%.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe continued existence of poverty in the 1960s was also characterised by differences in health between different social classes. In 1964-65 the incidence of infant deaths was more than half as much higher in the two lowest social classes than in the two highest social classes. In 1961-62 28% of all men recorded at least one spell of sickness of four days or more. For the lowest social classes, however, 35% of men had experienced this, compared with 18% of men in the highest social classes.[11] There is evidence that in large families the height of children was less than that for the average, while families with three or more children were more likely to be inadequately nourished.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his 1979 work \\"Poverty in the UK\\", Townsend suggested that 15 million people lived in or on the margins of poverty. He also argued that to get a proper measure of relative deprivation, there was a need to take into account other factors apart from income measures such as peoples environment, employment, and housing standards.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to one study, 365,000 families in Britain (excluding Northern Ireland) in 1966 were in poverty by an old assistance standard, and 450,000 families by a new standard.[13] In another study on poverty, Wilfred Beckerman estimated that 9.9% of the British population lived below a standardised poverty line in 1973, compared with 6.1% of the population of Belgium.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nLow pay was also a major cause of poverty,[15][16] with a report by the TUC in 1968 finding that about 5 million females and about 2.5 million males earned less than S15 a week.[10] According to one study, around 20% to 23% of employees in the late 1960s had low hourly wages.[17] In 1974, a quarter of adult employees in Britain earned less than S27 a week or less before tax, only slightly above the officially defined poverty line for an average family.[18] Regional differences in pay also remained pronounced during the post-war period.[19] Slum housing also remained a problem, with 12% of British households living in houses or flats considered to be unfit for human habitation in 1972.[20] In 1975, government statistics estimated that 1,800,000 children lived in poverty.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the number of people estimated to be living in poor housing conditions was lower at the start of the 1970s than at the start of the 1960s. In 1961, 4,700,000 households lived in unfit or substandard homes, compared with 2,846,000 in 1971.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the late 1960s and 1970s, progress was made in reducing the level of post-war poverty and inequality,[22] with 3 million families in Britain in poverty in 1977, compared with 5 million in 1961.[23] According to the 1971 Supplementary Benefits scale, the percentage of individuals living in poverty fell from 9.4% in 1963 to 2.3% in 1973.[24] Low pay continued to remain a major problem by the end of the 1970s, however, particularly amongst manual workers.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on various measurements, however, the number of Britons living in poverty rose significantly from 1979 to 1985. The number of Britons living in poverty (when defined as living below the Supplementary Benefit level) rose from 2,090,000 to 2,420,000 during that period, while the number of people living in poverty when defined as living on or below the Supplementary Benefit level rose from 6,070,000 to 9,380,000. Using a poverty measurement of living at 140% of the Supplementary Benefit level or below, the rise was from 11,570,000 to 15,420,000.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1979 to 1987, the number of Britons living in poverty (defined as living on less than half the national average income) doubled, from roughly 10% to 20% of the whole population. In 1989, almost 6 million full-time workers, representing 37% of the total full-time workforce, earned less than the \\"decency threshold\\" defined by the Council of Europe as 68% of average full-time earnings.[27] In 1994, 76.7% of all part-time workers earned less than this threshold.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nFigures from the European Commission estimated that from 1975 to 1985 the number of people living in poverty had doubled in Britain, from just over 3 million to 6.5 million. In 1975, the United Kingdom had fewer people living in poverty than Germany, Italy, Belgium, and Luxembourg. By 1989, Britain had a higher poverty than each of these four countries. In 1989, 12% of the UK population was estimated to be living in poverty, compared with 11.7% in Italy, 8.5% in Germany, 7.9% in Luxembourg, 7.4% in the Netherlands, and 7.2% in Belgium.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the late 1990s onwards, however, poverty began to fall steadily, helped by policies such as big increases in National Insurance benefits[29] and the National Minimum Wage Act 1998.[30] Using the 60% of median income after housing costs poverty line, the percentage of the British population living in poverty rose to 25.3% in 1996/97, compared with 13.7% in 1979.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1997/98 to 2004/05 (using the same 60% of median income after housing costs measurement), the percentage of the population living in poverty fell from 24.4% to 20.5%.[31] A 2000 report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimated that 4 million people lacked access to a healthy diet,[32] while a review of EU food and health policies estimated that food poverty was far higher in the UK than any other EU member state.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also Hunger in the UK in the 21st century\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rates of poverty fell just before the turn of the century and continued to do so until 2004-5.  The Institute of Fiscal Studies has counted the number of people in Absolute Poverty as falling from c.37% in 1996/7 (21.8m people) to c.22% in 2004/5 (13.2m), a figure that remained the same in 2014/5 (14.1m taking population growth into account).[31][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trend for Relative Poverty is the same (a fall in the number of poor from 1997/8 until 2004/5 and a relatively stable amount since then), although the earlier numbers are lower.  Alternatively it is suggested poverty rose from about 2008 to 2012 but remained stable since then.[35] Socially excluded people are ten times more likely to die early than the general population.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges to the benefit system from April 2017, such as not allowing some claimants to claim for more than two children, are predicted to increase the number of families in poverty and push a quarter of a million additional children into poverty. Policy in Practice estimates the two child limit will increase child poverty by 10% during this parliament. The Child Poverty Action Group charity (CPAG), claim it will reduce children's life chances.  Alison Thewliss said, \\"When Theresa May stood on the steps of Downing Street last year, she said that her new government would strive to help the just about managing in society. It appears that this was just empty rhetoric. (...) The reality is that two-thirds of those affected are already in work.\\"[37][38]  A doctor claims it is not unusual for up to seven people to live in a one bedroom flat. Parents sometimes do without food themselves in order to care for children, and others cannot afford clothes, toothbrushes, or toothpaste. Basic hygiene products like shampoo and sanitary towels are sometimes hard for poor people to afford, and some must choose between buying hygiene products and buying food.  Just under one in five UK children under 15 suffers food insecurity. That means sufficient safe, nutritious food cannot be guaranteed.[39][40] The minimum wage is insufficient to cover basic living expenses.[41]  Nearly half of schools provide anti poverty services like food banks, clothes banks or emergency loans to families.  Alison Garnham of the Child Poverty Action Group said, \\"With nine children in every classroom of 30 falling below the official poverty line, it is time to rebuild the safety net for struggling families.\\"[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren become sick because they cannot keep warm at home; overcrowding and damp worsens respiratory conditions. Alison Garnham of CPAG said, \\"Day in, day out, doctors see the damage rising poverty does to children's health. Low family incomes, inadequate housing and cuts to support services are jeopardising the health of our most vulnerable children. (...) Re-instating the UK's poverty-reduction targets would be an obvious place to start.\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nEurostat figures show that the numbers of Britons at risk of poverty fell to 15.9% in 2014, down from 17.1% in 2010 and 19% in 2005 (after social transfers were taken into account).[44] However, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) fears that people who are \\"just about managing\\" could fall into poverty, as it forecast that the wages of people in low income and benefits might not keep pace with inflation.[35] One third of UK households are living below what is considered an adequate income according to the JRF research.[45] Campbell Robb of the JRF said, \\"Millions of families across the country are teetering on a precipice, with 400,000 pensioners and over one million more children likely to fall into poverty and suffer the very real and awful consequences that brings if things do not change. One of the biggest drivers of the rise in child poverty is policy choices, which is why it is essential that the Prime Minister and Chancellor use the upcoming Budget to put in place measures to stop this happening. An excellent start would be to ensure families can keep more of their earnings under the Universal Credit.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty exists in rural communities as well as in urban areas.  Rural poverty is frequently overlooked.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common form of child poverty today is poverty in working families.  Roughly 30% of British children are now classed as poor and of those two-thirds are from working families. Analysts claim cuts to working-age benefits would likely increase poverty rates greatly during the three years following 2017.  Campbell Robb said, These troubling figures are warning signs we could be at the beginning of a sharp rise in poverty, with forecasts suggesting child poverty could rise further by 2021.[48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn work poverty can be compounded by employees who do not get the pay that they are entitled to. A 2017 report by Middlesex University and Trust for London revealed that at least 2 million workers in Britain are losing an estimated S3 billion in unpaid holiday pay and wages per year. It suggested that withholding holiday pay, not paying wages and workers losing a couple of hours money per week are some of the deliberate strategies used by employers to improve their profits.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nFood Standards Agency (FSA) research suggests some poor people miss meals or do without healthy food due to financial pressure. One third of unemployed people have cut out meals or reduced the quality of their diet due to lack of cash. 8% of respondents to a survey have low or very low food security, implying just under four million adults regularly struggle to get enough to eat. Other studies showed benefit freezes together with rising food prices are major factors in food insecurity. Rachel Loopstra who lectures in nutrition at Kings College London, said: These robust survey data confirm how serious the scale of the problem of people not having enough money for food to eat is in the UK, and are consistent with reports of increasing food bank usage. Anna Taylor of the 'Food Foundation' thinktank, said: To take so many British people off the breadline the government must drive uptake of the Healthy Start programme for young and low-income mothers, tackle gaps in food provision during school holidays, and review our welfare policies to protect the diets of societys most vulnerable. Campaigners and MPs have urged the UK government to monitor food insecurity. Ministers so far refused but the Scottish government agreed to enact a food insecurity measure. Women and young people are more likely to live in food insecure households.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies says the benefit rate freeze and child tax credit cuts, together with the rollout of universal credit, which is less generous due to changes in work allowances, means, large losses for low-income households.  John McDonnell said the IFS analysis showed a clear threat to working peoples living standards, while the Liberal Democrats said that the savage cuts would make millions of households poorer. Projected benefit cuts will lead to the poorest working-age households losing between 4% and 10% of their income a year, according to the IFS.[52] Fewer than one in ten British people believe all work is fair and decent, and 75% think more should be done to make work fairer.  Many British people suffer insecure work with zero hours contracts.[53]  Nearly half of workers are anxious over basic household expenses like food, transport and energy. One in six workers had left the heating off despite it being cold to save on fuel bills, and similar numbers had pawned possessions in the previous year because they were short of money.[54]  Rents are rising and housing benefit is not rising to match this. Families are forced into increasing poverty, some facing a daily struggle to pay their rent and put food on their table. Some risk homelessness.  Families with children are most affected and two thirds of affected families are in work.[55] Homelessness has risen over the last six years and the National Audit Office thinks welfare reforms and a freeze in housing benefit are a likely cause.[56]  Over a million vulnerable people with low incomes are experiencing worse poverty because they have to rent in the private rental sector since social accommodation is in very short supply.  A shortage of social housing caused the private rented sector to double over 25 years.  That forced more households, sizable numbers on benefits with dependent children or a disabled person, to pay appreciably more for inappropriate housing.  Benefit sanctions drive tennants into rent arreas, can lead to evictions and homelessness.  Dr Julie Rugg of the centre for housing policy at the University of York said,  Because of sanctions youre more likely to fall into arrears and to be asked to leave because you are in arrears,  The welfare system change has created vulnerability. It didnt used to be the case 10 years ago but it is now. People know the benefits system is tightening up but they might not realise that if youre at the bottom end and receiving benefits then your situation can be pretty precarious indeed.  38% of the private rented sector today is low income households, classed as vulnerable and 90% of these are either in poverty or living in overcrowded conditions.  The short supply of social housing enables private landlords to charge more than housing associations, frequently for worse accommodation.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn All Party Parliamentary Group on Hunger warned that too many poorer UK children are hungry or malnourished during school holidays. Some subsist on a diet of crisps or stodgy food. One million children who receive free school meals during term time are at risk, as are two million more from working poor families. For both types, school holidays add to financial pressure on families through the need to pay for childcare, food and fuel. These children return to school in bad physical shape, learn less well and get behind children who were better fed during school holidays. The life chances of underfed children are damaged.[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen housing benefit does not fully cover rent, people can struggle to pay rent and buy other necessities as well. This can lead to increasing debt. Anne Baxendale of Shelter, said: We are deeply concerned that the current freeze on housing benefit is piling a huge amount of pressure on to thousands of private renters who are already teetering on the brink of homelessness.  People are forced out of their homes because they cannot pay their rent and all their other bills.[60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2017, 20% of UK people live in poverty including 8 million working-age adults, 4 million children and 1.9 million pensioners. Research by the JRF found nearly 400,000 more UK children and 300,000 more UK pensioners were in poverty in 2016-17 compared with 2012-13.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom April 2018, child benefit will be limited to the first two children, which will affect 150,000 families. Withdrawal of family element from new Universal Credit claims and tax credit claims for families with children will affect 400,000 families.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nSingle parents are particularly heavily affected by benefit sanctions. A 2018 report from Gingerbread and Trust for London showed that three times as many single parents were sanctioned under JSA in 2016/17 than 2005/06. These sanctions can compound the financial hardship of those already on a low income.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, Citizens Advice stated that up to 140,000 households went without power as they could not afford to top up prepayment meters and most such households included children or someone with a long term health problem.  The Living Wage Foundation stated many poorest parents went without meals, a third of parents on low incomes do this regularly through lack of money.  Roughly half of those families are behind with household bills.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nTUC sponsored research indicates that 3.1 million children in working families will be below the official breadline in 2018, this is a million more than in 2010. About 600,000 children with working parents became poor due to the government's benefit cuts and public sector pay limits, the report by the consultancy Landman Economics stated. The research found that the biggest increase in child poverty among working families will be in the East Midlands, followed by the West Midlands and Northern Ireland.[66] Teachers and teaching assistants bring items into schools like food, sanitary products and toilet paper for children from families that are short of these things.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nInflation has been rising while the level of many benefits has remained fixed in money terms. This is causing hardship to low-income families and there are calls for the level of benefits to be increased.[68]  Over 14 million people, as well as 4.5 million children, live below the breadline, and over half are trapped in poverty for years.  Poverty is particularly frequent in families with a disabled person, single-parent families, and households where no one works or that are dependent for income on irregular or zero-hours jobs.  12% of the UK population have spent the bulk or all of the four years to 2018 below the breadline.  Alison Garnham of the Child Poverty Action Group said, What we now need is for government to move on from its denial of the problem, set targets for reducing and eradicating child poverty, and implement policies to support low-income families.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies predicted children living in poverty will reach a record 5.2 million over the five years from 2018 as government welfare cuts take effect, more than reversing all the progress made over the previous 20 years.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany poor people live in areas where there is no large supermarket nearby and must rely on corner shops where food is less healthy.  Poor people in these areas cannot easily afford to buy fresh fruit and vegetables or to travel to large supermarkets where there is healthier food. Such areas include Marfleet in Hull, Hartcliffe in Bristol, Hattersley in Greater Manchester, Everton in Liverpool and Sparkbrook in Birmingham. Eight of the ten most deprived areas in Scotland are in Glasgow, and three of the nine worst in Wales are in Cardiff.  Poor people, older people and disabled people are most affected when fresh food is not available locally.  nearly 4 million UK children are judged to live in households that would find it difficult to afford enough fruit, vegetables and other healthy foods to reach official guidelines, the Food Foundation maintains. Food prices increased by 7.7% from 2002 to 2016, while the poorest families' incomes fell by 7.1%.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Office for National Statistics has estimated that in 2011, 14 million people were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, and that one person in 20 (5.1%) was now experiencing \\"severe material depression.\\"[citation needed] Poverty among young people increased by 3.9% from 2007 to 2010.[71] In assessing social inequality in Britain, Danny Dorling has noted that \\"people in different parts of Britain and people living within different quarters of its cities are living in different worlds with different norms and expectations. This was not the case a few decades ago. This is not the case to the same extent in the majority of affluent nations in the world.\\"[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nA new term is appearing, 'Just About Managing' or 'JAM'.  This applies to people who can put food on the table and pay rent or mortgage at least part of the time but have problems if their income falls or if there are unexpected bills.  JAM's are typically families where at least one person works.  JAM's may suffer social exclusion being unable to afford holidays or evenings out.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Resolution Foundation claims that the incomes of the poorest 10% in the UK will fall by 3% in real terms by 2020 due to government policies on tax and welfare. The lowest third of incomes will suffer falls in income over the coming years. Incomes will fall because many welfare benefits that poorer people receive have been frozen in cash terms and with inflation cash will be worth steadily less.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\n  In 2017-18 the Resolution Foundation reckons the official poverty rate increased from 22.1% to 23.2%, the child poverty rate rose in 2017-18 from 30.3% to 33.4%.  Cuts to benefits and inflation are blamed for the rise, benefit levels have remained unchanged in money terms while inflation erodes their real value.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies reported the numbers of poor United Kingdom children in wage-earning families increased from 2009 to 2014 and more poor children currently live in working families than live in families on benefits. The IFS reported \\"Recent falls in inequality are likely to prove temporary. Stronger earnings growth and the Conservatives planned income tax cuts would do most for incomes towards the top of the distribution, while planned benefit cuts will hit low-income households [both in and out of work] hardest.\\"[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne Longfield, Children's Commissioner for England wrote: \\"The majority of children living in poverty have at least one parent who is working. Employment is important but if wages do not rise substantially in relation to living costs it will not provide a route out of poverty alone. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has today published a report stating that families with children working full-time on the National Minimum Wage are now 15% short of the Minimum Income Standard that people believe offers an acceptable standard of living.  Today's announcement will effectively confine to history any figures on the millions of children being raised in families who experience in-work poverty denying them necessities such as adequate food, clothing and heating.\\"[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nJulia Unwin of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: \\"A strong economy and rising employment have masked the growing problem of in-work poverty, as years of below-inflation wage rises have taken their toll on people's incomes. The upcoming minimum wage rise will help, but many low-income working families will still find themselves worse off due to tax-credit changes. Boosting productivity and creating more jobs which offer progression at work is vital to make work a reliable route out of poverty.\\"[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nCampbell Robb of Shelter said: \\"It's heart-breaking to think that so many people are having to make a choice between paying the rent and putting food on the table, or living in fear that any drop in income would leave them unable to cover their housing costs.  The sad truth is that far too many people in Britain right now are living in homes that just aren't up to scratch - from the thousands of families forced to cope with poor conditions, to a generation of renters forking out most of their income on housing each month and unable to save for the future.\\"[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2015 there is actual hunger in the United Kingdom and significant numbers of UK citizens are driven to use food banks.  There is also significant malnutrition.  Poorer people are frequently forced to buy and eat cheaper, less healthy food.  The BMJ, a UK peer-reviewed medical journal published:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the poorest in our society, up to 35% of disposable income will now be needed for food, compared to less than 9% for the more wealthy. This will increase reliance on cheap, highly processed, high fat, high sugar, high salt, and calorie-dense, unhealthy foods. Re-emerging problems of poor public health nutrition such as rickets and malnutrition in the elderly are also causes for concern.\\r\\nIn 2016, 10% of UK households lived in fuel poverty. Fuel poverty is calculated by gauging if a household's income would fall below the official poverty line after spending the actual amount needed to heat the home. The average fuel poverty gap of these households ÿ that is, the amount needed to escape fuel poverty ÿ is S371 a year, the latest figures indicate, with those in privately rented properties hit hardest.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2013 report commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation[82] poverty and participation are analyzed as a social phenomenon characterizing UK society following the tradition initiated several decades ago by Peter Townsend. Participation in society is measured in terms of social relationships, membership of organisations, trust in other people, ownership of possessions and purchase of services. The study finds out that all these dimensions of participation are lower among people with low incomes. While participation generally drops as income declines, participation stops falling among the 30 percent or so of people with the lowest incomes, creating a participation 'floor'. The 30 percent of people with the lowest incomes are forced to choose between the basic necessities of modern life; they must decide which needs to neglect.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor people affected by the floor, additional income may well be spent on upgrading the quality of necessary goods and services rather than adding to them. Averages mask important variation. The participation floor for benefit recipients is lower than for other groups on the same income. Most minority ethnic groups experience greater material deprivation than the white majority but social participation is, on average, higher. Children's engagement in school life and friends is not directly affected by household income. However, parents on low incomes, on average, play less often with their children and spend less on activities. This is associated with poorer educational outcomes as judged by teachers. Low-income parents frequently spend more time than affluent ones assisting children with their school work because they have fallen behind their classmates.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty and economic insecurity increase the risk that a person will commit suicide. The Samaritans claim that the British economic condition ÿ including low incomes, job insecurity, zero-hours contracts, unmanageable debts and poor housing ÿ all add to suicide risk.  A report titled Dying from Inequality describes overwhelming evidence of a link between socioeconomic disadvantage and suicidal behaviour.  Men in the lowest social class, living in the most deprived areas, are up to 10 times more at risk of suicide than those in the highest social class living in the most affluent areas, the report says. Unemployed people are more at risk of suicide than people with work, people with low education and people living in deprived areas are also at increased risk.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe persistence of high poverty rates in the UK is associated with the relatively low generosity of the welfare state. The UK social security system is characterised by a residual welfare state model based on the notion of market dominance and private provision.[citation needed] The state only intervenes to moderate extreme poverty and provide for basic needs, largely on a means-tested basis.[84][85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, inequality has been forecast to return to the levels of the Thatcher years. Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation, said: \\"[A] boom is slowing rapidly as inflation rises, productivity flatlines and employment growth slows.  ... This time around its low- and middle-income families with kids who are set to be worst affected.  This could leave Britain with the worst of both worlds on living standards ÿ the weak income growth of the last parliament and rising inequality from the time Margaret Thatcher was in Downing Street.  The prime ministers focus on supporting just managing families is absolutely right.\\"[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty within the UK is particularly concentrated in Wales. While the relative income-poverty rate for the UK stood at 16.8% in 2014, the same poverty rate for Wales stood at 23% in the same year.[87][88] Poverty in Wales has remained in the 25% range, with only small dips throughout the last decade.[88] While the trends correlate with overall reductions in less impoverished areas of the UK, it does not correlate with Scotland, who in the 1990s, had a relative similar poverty trend as Wales.[87] Conservative attitudes began to grow during the reign of the Labour party in the 2000s, culminating in an overall negative opinion towards public spending increases beginning in the 2010s.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nData published in 2017 by the New Policy Institute and the Trust for London found that 27% of Londoners live in poverty, six percentage points higher than in the rest of England. This represents 2.3 million Londoners, 58% of whom are in a working family.[90] Further research published by Trust for London, carried out by Loughborough University, found that two in five Londoners cannot afford what the public regard as a decent standard of living ÿ one that allows them to meet their basic needs and participate in society at a minimum level. This is significantly higher than the 30% that fall below the standard in the UK as a whole, and represents 3.3 million Londoners.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table below shows the percentage of the population in poverty derived by three different measures: relative poverty (earning less than 60% of the median), the National Assistance scale and the Supplementary Benefits scale. Estimates from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimates of poverty in the United Kingdom from 1950-1975 (percentage of population)[93]\\r\\n\\r\\n1953-54: 1.2% (Abel-Smith and Townsend, FES) Unit: Household\\r\\n\\r\\n1954: 12.3% (Gough and Stark, IR) Unit: Tax unit\\r\\n\\r\\n1959: 8.8% (Gough and Stark, IR) Unit: Tax unit\\r\\n\\r\\n1960: 3.8% (Abel-Smith and Townsend, FES) Unit: Household\\r\\n\\r\\n1963: 9.4% (Gough and Stark, IR) Unit: Tax unit\\r\\n\\r\\n1967: 3.5% (Atkinson, FES) Unit: Household\\r\\n\\r\\n1969: 3.4% (Atkinson, FES) Unit: Household\\r\\n\\r\\n1968-69: 6.4% (Townsend, Survey) Unit: Household\\r\\n\\r\\n1971: 4.9% (Fiegehen et al., FES) Unit: Household\\r\\n\\r\\n1975: 11.3% (Berthoud and Brown, GHS) Unit: Household\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common measure for poverty, as used in the Child Poverty Act 2010, is household income below 60 percent of median income. The median is such an income that exactly a half of households earn more than that and the other half earns less.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014/5, the median income in the UK was S473 per week (S24,596 a year). Those earning 60% of this figure (S284 a week / S14,758 a year) were considered to be in the low income bracket.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the definition that is used by the UK government's Department of Work and Pensions in its yearly survey Households below average income.[95] However, their reports expressly avoid using the word poverty, using low income instead. Reports from others agencies, such as the Institute of Fiscal Studies Living Standards, Poverty and Inequality in the UK, use the same methodology, but specifically use the word poverty.[34][96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis measure can be further divided.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who live in absolute poverty have a household income below 60 percent of median income' as compared to a rate fixed in 2010/11 and that only changes in line with inflation.\\r\\nThose who live in relative poverty have a household income below 60 percent of median income' as compared to all other incomes in the same year.\\r\\nAbsolute poverty is better at judging poverty in the short term, whereas relative poverty is better at seeing long-term trends. This is because general concepts of poverty change with time, and relative poverty reflects this better.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nReports on poverty also tend to take housing costs in to account, distinguishing between before housing costs (BHC, where housing costs such as rent and mortgage interest payments have not been deducted) and after housing costs (AHC). Different social groups in the UK tend to have vastly different costs for housing, affecting available income.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nRelative poverty was used before its formal adoption now. In the early 1980s, Tony Byrne and Colin F. Padfield defined relative poverty in Britain as a situation in which people are able to survive adequately, but they are either less well off than they used to be (such as when they retire from paid employment) or that they are at a serious disadvantage \\"in their ability to experience or enjoy the standard of life of most other people ÿ for example, not being able to afford an annual holiday.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, there was some discussion of the measurement for poverty being changed (from households earning less than 60% of median income) to a broader analysis of poverty.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs opposed to measuring income, the Consensual Method examines which necessities (e.g. food, clothing, access to healthcare, involvement in social and leisure activities) are thought by the general public to be essential for living in contemporary UK society.[98] Those families or individual who lack a number of these necessities are considered as poor.  In the 2012 Poverty and Social Exclusion (PSE) survey on Living Standards, the three necessities deemed as being most often essential to a good standard of living were the ability 'to warm living areas of the home ', a 'damp-free home' and 'two meals a day.'[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix specific surveys of low standards of living in the UK have made use of this method. \\r\\n\\r\\nWater poverty is defined by the government as spending more than 3% of disposable income on water bills. Nationally, in 2006, nearly 10% of households were in water poverty.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nFuel poverty. A fuel poor household is one that struggles to keep adequately warm at reasonable cost. The most widely accepted definition of a fuel poor household is one which needs to spend more than 10% of its income on all fuel use and to heat the home to an adequate standard of warmth. This is generally defined as 21?C in the living room and 18?C in the other occupied rooms.[101][102] Fuel poverty affects over a million British working households and over 2.3 million households in total and increases in energy prices affect poor people severely.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nEurostat figures show that the numbers of Britons at risk of poverty has fallen to 15.9% in 2014, down from 17.1% in 2010 and 19% in 2005 (after social transfers were taken into account).[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the poverty line is defined as those individuals and households with incomes less than 60% of their respective medians, then \\"nearly 60%\\" of those in poverty are homeowners.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeebohm Rowntree chose a basic 'shopping basket' of foods (identical to the rations given in the local workhouse), clothing and housing needs ÿ anyone unable to afford them was deemed to be in poverty. By 1950, with the founding of the modern welfare state, the 'shopping basket' measurement had been abandoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vast and overwhelming majority of people that fill the government's current criteria for poverty status (see above) have goods unimaginable to those in poverty in 1900. Poverty in the developed world is often one of perception; people compare their wealth with neighbours and wider society, not with their ancestors or those in foreign countries. Indeed, this is formalised in the government's measure of poverty. A number of studies have shown that though prosperity in the UK has greatly increased, the level of happiness people report has remained the same or even decreased since the 1950s.[109][110][111]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople enter the world of poverty due to: problems at the individual/family level and problems with the economy as a whole. Problems at the individual level include: race (human categorization), gender, sexual orientation, drug use, and level of education. Problems with the economy can include: low labor participation and high levels of unemployment .[112] Welfare is financial support given by the government to people in need. There are pressures on the welfare state because welfare must be justified in terms of its contribution to economic success. Welfare must contribute positively to the economy otherwise there is a risk of damaging currency values. Damage to currency values will damage trading positions and investment which will, in turn, hurt the economy overall.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) is responsible for the welfare services in the United Kingdom. Income maintenance is centrally administered through DHSS offices (regional and local level).[114] Those who earn 39 pounds a week (except some married women) or more must contribute to the National Insurance Scheme. The National Health Service (NHS) provides virtually free healthcare for all residents ÿ this is also centrally administered.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersistent poverty is the effects of experiencing low income for long periods of time. In 2014, 6.5% of the United Kingdom's population was classified as being in persistent poverty; that equates to approximately 3.9 million people. The UK's poverty rate overall in 2014 was the 12th highest amongst all European nations at 16.8%, however; it has the third-lowest persistent poverty rate.[115] Income tends to be measured before or after housing costs are accounted for (BHC or AHC).[116] Poverty levels tend to be higher after housing costs are accounted for because the poorer households need to spend a higher percentage of their income on housing. In 2014-2015, 13.5 million people were in relative low income AHC (an increase of 300,000 from the year before) and 12.9 million people were in absolute low income AHC (a decrease of 700,000 from the year before). Relative low income means that people live in households with income below 60% of the median in a specified year. Absolute income means that people live in households with income below 60% of the median income in some base year.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, the incomes of poor households are extremely sensitive to the activity in the labor market. When any downturn in the labor market occurs, the poorest people in the UK are increasingly more vulnerable and at greater risk.[117] Median income (overall) has moved 2% above pre-crisis (2007-2008) levels. During the recovery period, inequality in workers earnings has decreased. There has been strong employment growth along with weak earnings growth which have kept inequality low for several years.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, Tony Blair, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, pledged that child poverty in the United Kingdom will end within a generation. The goal was to completely eradicate child poverty by 2020. Poverty is a result of several different factors, some of which include a lack of education and training, low participation in the labour market, poor working conditions and affordable housing.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key components of the UK's strategy to fight poverty are: \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most crucial ways to reduce poverty is to increase benefit take-up. In 2009-10 almost a third of those who were eligible for means-tested benefit did not claim. In 2011-2012, 15% of those eligible for Child Tax Credit did not claim, neither did 35% of those eligible for Working Tax Credit.[112] Improving these numbers and getting those people to claim their entitlements would significantly help reduce poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWays that would help to increase benefit take-up include:\\r\\n\\r\\nA decrease in poverty would mean a more active economy because more people would have the ability to purchase more consumer goods.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the UK General Election of 2015, research was undertaken to analyse  the commitment of the UK's political parties in addressing poverty. It demonstrated that \\"poverty has been overlooked as an issue in the General Election campaign\\" and that only the Green Party had an effective policy to deal with poverty. Analysis of other parties' policies and how they are used to deal with poverty ended in negative conclusions: \\"The Conservatives and UKIP both performed fairly badly\\". Labour performed better in some specific policy areas when compared to the Conservatives, but \\"there is not very much difference between them.\\" Overall, the audit noted that views towards poverty were affected by specific views for those receiving social security benefits: \\"there was a general tendency to come down hard on welfare recipients, with a shift towards means-testing and victim-blaming across the board. This can be seen particularly in the context of Immigration and Housing.\\"[120][non-primary source needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile leader of the Labour Government, Tony Blair vowed in 1999 to cut child poverty 25% by 2005, 50% by 2010 and to eradicate child poverty completely by 2020. The Labour Party website states:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"In 1997 Labour inherited one of the highest rates of child poverty in Europe ÿ with one in three children living in poverty. Our mission to abolish child poverty is grounded both in our determination to secure social justice, and to tackle the problems that the social exclusion of children builds up for the long-term. Work is the best route out of poverty and our successful welfare to work measures have lifted millions out of poverty including disabled people, who have too often previously been consigned to a life on benefits. At the same time, millions of families are benefiting from the Child tax credit, the Working tax credit, and record rises in Child benefit.\\"[121]\\r\\nTheir 2005 manifesto[122] states:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"[Since the Labour government came to power in 1997] there are two million fewer children and nearly two million fewer pensioners living in absolute poverty.\\"\\r\\nIn late November 2006, the Conservative Party garnered headlines across the press when a senior member spoke out on poverty, invoking the name of Polly Toynbee. The headlines began when David Cameron's policy advisor and shadow minister Greg Clark wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The traditional Conservative vision of welfare as a safety net encompasses another outdated Tory nostrum ÿ that poverty is absolute, not relative. Churchill's safety net is at the bottom: holding people at subsistence level, just above the abyss of hunger and homelessness. It is the social commentator Polly Toynbee who supplies imagery that is more appropriate for Conservative social policy in the twenty first century.\\"[123][124]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis approach generated much comment and analysis.[125] It was followed two days later by Cameron saying poverty should be seen in relative terms to the rest of society, where people lack those things which others in society take for granted, \\"those who think otherwise are wrong [...] I believe that poverty is an economic waste, a moral disgrace. [...] We will only tackle the causes of poverty if we give a bigger role to society, tackling poverty is a social responsibility [...] Labour rely too heavily on redistributing money, and on the large, clunking mechanisms of the state.\\"[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people's ability to sustain their lifestyle and to participate socially comes under threat at around the bottom 30% of the income distribution, creating a sort of 'participation floor' that seems to demarcate a major divide in British society.[127] The floor begins around the point in the income distribution when the benefit system starts to contribute substantially to people's incomes but is not entirely rigid or for example, it is lower for recipients of social security benefits mainly on account of the greater material deprivation that they experience. For those on the floor, participation is severely constrained with people negotiating a zero-sum world in which spending on one area means reduction in another. Whereas for those above the floor, additional income translates into more evident consumption, greater social participation and trust; for those on the floor it means a slight easing of pressure, but no major change in lifestyle sufficient to be identified in survey evidence. The implications for policy and our understanding of society are profound. Much policy, notably the new Universal Credit that was the flagship policy of the past Coalition Government, seeks to maximise work incentives premised on the notion that additional income brings rewards for individuals in terms of higher living standards, and benefits society through greater consumption and a shared work ethic. Similarly, as emphasised by Lansley and Mack,[128] New Labour during the period 1997ÿ2010 (despite trying to tackle child poverty) intervened mainly through more generous and wide-ranging tax-credits rather than fighting poverty and inequality at source.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation is one of the largest social policy research and development charities in the UK and takes particular interest in the issue of poverty, with over 2,000 reports on poverty and disadvantage available on its website.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Child Poverty Action Group campaigns for the elimination of poverty amongst children.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd Child Poverty coalition also seeks the eradication of child poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oxfam UK Poverty Programme[130] works with people and policy makers to tackle the causes of poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2013 Freedom from Torture published its report \\"The Poverty Barrier: The Right to Rehabilitation for Survivors of Torture in the UK[131] which highlights the failings of the UK Asylum System in their handling of torture survivors arriving in the UK. The evidence included in the report comes from the testimony of over 100 survivors of torture and eighteen members of Freedom from Torture's clinical department. The report highlights financial insecurity, social exclusion and hopelessness and how poverty prevents the rehabilitation process. One survivor stated: \\"... Our current living conditions keep our torture trauma still alive. We can't move on.\\"","input":"What is the poverty line in the uk?"},{"output":"Allegheny and Monongahela rivers called the Forks of the Ohio, and the site of the French Fort Duquesne within present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","context":"British victory\\r\\n?Great Britain\\r\\nIroquois Confederacy\\r\\n?France\\r\\nWabanaki Confederacy\\r\\nThe French and Indian War (1754ÿ63) comprised the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War of 1756ÿ63. It pitted the colonies of British America against those of New France. Both sides were supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as by American Indian allies. At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies.[3] The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. The European nations declared war on one another in 1756 following months of localized conflict, escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict.\\r\\nThe name French and Indian War is used mainly in the United States. It refers to the two main enemies of the British colonists: the royal French forces and the various American Indian forces allied with them. The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois, Catawba, and Cherokee, and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy members Abenaki and Mi'kmaq, and Algonquin, Lenape, Ojibwa, Ottawa, Shawnee, and Wyandot.\\r\\nBritish and other European historians use the term the Seven Years' War, as do English-speaking Canadians.[4] French Canadians call it La guerre de la Conqute (the War of the Conquest)[5][6] or (rarely) the Fourth Intercolonial War.[7][not in citation given]\\r\\nFighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north. It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers called the Forks of the Ohio, and the site of the French Fort Duquesne within present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754, during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22-year-old George Washington ambushed a French patrol.\\r\\nIn 1755, six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock, the newly arrived British Army commander, and planned a four-way attack on the French. None succeeded, and the main effort by Braddock proved a disaster; he lost the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9, 1755 and died a few days later. British operations failed in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York during 1755-57 due to a combination of poor management, internal divisions, effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies. In 1755, the British captured Fort Beausjour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia, and they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians (1755ÿ64) soon afterwards. Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley, Commander-in-Chief, North America, without direction from Great Britain. The Acadians were expelled, both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty. Indians likewise were driven off the land to make way for settlers from New England.[8]\\r\\nThe British colonial government fell in the region of modern Nova Scotia after several disastrous campaigns in 1757, including a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry; this last was followed by Indians torturing and massacring their British victims. William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces that they had in New France, preferring to concentrate their forces against Prussia and its allies in the European theater of the war. Between 1758 and 1760, the British military launched a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada (part of New France). They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately the city of Quebec (1759). The British later lost the Battle of Sainte-Foy west of Quebec (1760), but the French ceded Canada in accordance with the Treaty of Paris (1763).\\r\\nThe outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo-French conflict. France ceded to Great Britain its territory east of the Mississippi. It ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (including New Orleans) to its ally Spain in compensation for Spain's loss to Britain of Florida. (Spain had ceded Florida to Britain in exchange for the return of Havana, Cuba.) France's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, confirming Great Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conflict is known by multiple names. In British America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War. There had already been a King George's War in the 1740s during King George's reign, so British colonists named this conflict after their opponents and it became known as the French and Indian War.[9] This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain.[10] American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War. Less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire.[9]\\r\\nIn Europe, the North American theater of the Seven Years' War usually is not given a separate name. The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years' War. \\"Seven Years\\" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America which was largely concluded in six years, from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.[9]\\r\\nCanadians refer to both the European and North American conflicts as the Seven Years' War (Guerre de Sept Ans).[11][12] French Canadians also use the term \\"War of Conquest\\" (Guerre de la Conqute), since it is the war in which Canada was conquered by the British and became part of the British Empire.\\r\\nAt this time, North America east of the Mississippi River was largely claimed by either Great Britain or France. Large areas had no colonial settlements. The French population numbered about 75,000 and was heavily concentrated along the St. Lawrence River valley, with some also in Acadia (present-day New Brunswick and parts of Nova Scotia), including ?le Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island). Fewer lived in New Orleans, Biloxi, Mississippi, Mobile, Alabama, and small settlements in the Illinois Country, hugging the east side of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. French fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds, did business with local Indian tribes, and often married Indian women.[13] Traders married daughters of chiefs, creating high-ranking unions.\\r\\nBritish settlers outnumbered the French 20 to 1[14] with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north to Georgia in the south.[15] Many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west, as the extent of the continent was unknown at the time when their provincial charters were granted. Their population centers were along the coast, yet the settlements were growing into the interior. Nova Scotia had been captured from France in 1713, and it still had a significant French-speaking population. Britain also claimed Rupert's Land where the Hudson's Bay Company traded for furs with local Indian tribes.\\r\\nIn between the French and British colonists, large areas were dominated by Indian tribes. To the north, the Mi'kmaqs and the Abenakis were engaged in Father Le Loutre's War and still held sway in parts of Nova Scotia, Acadia, and the eastern portions of the province of Canada, as well as much of Maine.[16] The Iroquois Confederation dominated much of Upstate New York and the Ohio Country, although Ohio also included Algonquian-speaking populations of Delaware and Shawnee, as well as Iroquoian-speaking Mingos. These tribes were formally under Iroquois rule and were limited by them in their authority to make agreements.[17]\\r\\nThe Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan-speaking Catawbas, Muskogee-speaking Creeks and Choctaw, and the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee tribes.[18] When war broke out, the French colonists used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region, which was not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British; these included the Hurons, Mississaugs, Ojibwas, Winnebagos, and Potawatomi. The British colonists were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations and also by the Cherokees, until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758, the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creeks and Cherokees were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.\\r\\nBy this time, Spain claimed only the province of Florida in eastern North America; it controlled Cuba and other territories in the West Indies that became military objectives in the Seven Years' War. Florida's European population was a few hundred, concentrated in St. Augustine and Pensacola.\\r\\nAt the start of the war, no French regular army troops were stationed in North America, and few British troops. New France was defended by about 3,000 troupes de la marine, companies of colonial regulars (some of whom had significant woodland combat experience). The colonial government recruited militia support when needed. Most British colonies mustered local militia companies to deal with Indian threats, generally ill trained and available only for short periods, but they did not have any standing forces. Virginia, by contrast, had a large frontier with several companies of British regulars.\\r\\nThe colonial governments were used to operating independently of one another and of the government in London, a situation that complicated negotiations with Indian tribes, whose territories often encompassed land claimed by multiple colonies. After the war began, the leaders of the British Army establishment tried to impose constraints and demands on the colonial administrations.\\r\\nNew France's Governor-General Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissonire was concerned about the incursion and expanding influence in the Ohio Country of British colonial traders such as George Croghan. In June 1747, he ordered Pierre-Joseph Cloron to lead a military expedition through the area. Its objectives were:\\r\\nCloron's expedition force consisted of about 200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians, and they covered about 3,000 miles (4,800?km) between June and November 1749. They went up the St. Lawrence, continued along the northern shore of Lake Ontario, crossed the portage at Niagara, and followed the southern shore of Lake Erie. At the Chautauqua Portage near Barcelona, New York, the expedition moved inland to the Allegheny River which it followed to the site of Pittsburgh. There Cloron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country.[19] Whenever he encountered British colonial merchants or fur-traders, he informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave.[19]\\r\\nCloron's expedition arrived at Logstown where the Indians in the area informed him that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British colonists regardless of the French.[20] He continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the Ohio and the Miami rivers which lay just south of the village of Pickawillany, the home of the Miami chief known as \\"Old Briton\\". Cloron threatened Old Briton with severe consequences if he continued to trade with British colonists, but Old Briton ignored the warning. Cloron returned disappointedly to Montreal in November 1749.[21]\\r\\nCloron wrote an extensively detailed report. \\"All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French,\\" he wrote, \\"and are entirely devoted to the English. I don't know in what way they could be brought back.\\"[20] Even before his return to Montreal, reports on the situation in the Ohio Country were making their way to London and Paris, each side proposing that action be taken. Massachusetts governor William Shirley was particularly forceful, stating that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present.[22]\\r\\nIn 1749, the British government gave land to the Ohio Company of Virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the Ohio Country.[23] The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory and construct a fort for their protection. But the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania, and both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims.[24] In 1750, Christopher Gist explored the Ohio territory, acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company, and he opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown.[25] He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians agreed to terms through their \\"Half-King\\" Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative. These terms included permission to build a strong house at the mouth of the Monongahela River on the modern site of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[26] By the late 17th century, the Iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the Ohio Valley, and they laid claim to it as their hunting ground by right of conquest.\\r\\nThe War of the Austrian Succession (better known as King George's War) formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle which was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe. The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies were turned over to a commission, but it reached no decision. Frontier areas were claimed by both sides, from Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north to the Ohio Country in the south. The disputes also extended into the Atlantic Ocean, where both powers wanted access to the rich fisheries of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.\\r\\nGovernor-General of New France Marquis de la Jonquire died on March 17, 1752, and he was temporarily replaced by Charles le Moyne de Longueuil. His permanent replacement was to be the Marquis Duquesne, but he did not arrive in New France until 1752 to take over the post.[27] The continuing British activity in the Ohio territories prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade, an officer in the Troupes de la Marine. Langlade was given 300 men, including French-Canadians and warriors of the Ottawa tribe. His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following Cloron's orders to cease trading with the British. On June 21, the French war party attacked the trading centre at Pickawillany, capturing three traders[21] and killing 14 Miami Indians, including Old Briton. He was reportedly ritually cannibalized by some Indians in the expedition party.\\r\\nIn the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians. His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British. Marin followed the route that Cloron had mapped out four years earlier. Cloron, however, had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, whereas Marin constructed and garrisoned forts. He first constructed Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie's south shore near Erie, Pennsylvania, and he had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. He then constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf in Waterford, Pennsylvania), designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson was a chief of the Mingo Indians, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. He intensely disliked the French whom he accused of killing and eating his father. He traveled to Fort Le Boeuf and threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.[28]\\r\\nThe Iroquois sent runners to the manor of William Johnson in upstate New York, who was the British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the New York region and beyond. Johnson was known to the Iroquois as Warraghiggey, meaning \\"he who does great things.\\" He spoke their languages and had become a respected honorary member of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area, and he was made a colonel of the Iroquois in 1746; he was later commissioned as a colonel of the Western New York Militia.\\r\\nThe Indian representatives and Johnson met with Governor Clinton and officials from some of the other American colonies at Albany, New York. Mohawk Chief Hendrick was the speaker of their tribal council, and he insisted that the British abide by their obligations[which?] and block French expansion. Clinton did not respond to his satisfaction, and Hendrick said that the \\"Covenant Chain\\" was broken, a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown.\\r\\nGovernor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia was an investor in the Ohio Company which stood to lose money if the French held their claim.[29] He ordered 21 year-old Major George Washington (whose brother was another Ohio Company investor) of the Virginia Regiment to warn the French to leave Virginia territory in October 1753.[30] Washington left with a small party, picking up Jacob Van Braam as an interpreter, Christopher Gist (a company surveyor working in the area), and a few Mingos led by Tanaghrisson. On December 12, Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf.[31][32]\\r\\nJacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre succeeded Marin as commander of the French forces after Marin died on October 29, and he invited Washington to dine with him. Over dinner, Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country. Saint-Pierre said, \\"As to the Summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it.\\"[33] He told Washington that France's claim to the region was superior to that of the British, since Ren-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.[34]\\r\\nWashington's party left Fort Le Boeuf early on December 16 and arrived in Williamsburg on January 16, 1754. He stated in his report, \\"The French had swept south\\",[35] detailing the steps which they had taken to fortify the area, and their intention to fortify the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers.[36]\\r\\nEven before Washington returned, Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under William Trent to that point where they began construction of a small stockaded fort in the early months of 1754.[37] Governor Duquesne sent additional French forces under Claude-Pierre Pecaudy de Contrec?ur to relieve Saint-Pierre during the same period, and Contrec?ur led 500 men south from Fort Venango on April 5, 1754.[38] These forces arrived at the fort on April 16, but Contrec?ur generously allowed Trent's small company to withdraw. He purchased their construction tools to continue building what became Fort Duquesne.[39]\\r\\nDinwiddie had ordered Washington to lead a larger force to assist Trent in his work, and Washington learned of Trent's retreat while he was en route.[40] Mingo sachem Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British, so Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with him. He then learned of a French scouting party in the area, so he combined Tanaghrisson's force with his own and surprised the Canadians on May 28 in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen. They killed many of the Canadians, including their commanding officer Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk. Historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and to regain authority over his own people. They had been inclined to support the French, with whom they had long trading relationships. One of Tanaghrisson's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire.[41]\\r\\nHistorians generally consider the Battle of Jumonville Glen as the opening battle of the French and Indian War in North America, and the start of hostilities in the Ohio valley.\\r\\nFollowing the battle, Washington pulled back several miles and established Fort Necessity, which the Canadians attacked under the command of Jummonville's brother at the Battle of Fort Necessity on July 3. Washington surrendered and negotiated a withdrawal under arms. One of his men reported that the Canadian force was accompanied by Shawnee, Delaware, and Mingo warriorsjust those whom Tanaghrisson was seeking to influence.[42]\\r\\nNews of the two battles reached England in August. After several months of negotiations, the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French.[43] They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition.[44] Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock's departure for North America. In response, King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755.[45] The British sent out their fleet in February 1755, intending to blockade French ports, but the French fleet had already sailed. Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America in an attempt to intercept them.\\r\\nIn a second British action, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on June 8, 1755, capturing her and two troop ships.[46] The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755, seizing ships and capturing seamen. These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756.[47]\\r\\nAn early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the Albany Congress in June and July, 1754. The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians, since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the war that was unfolding. The plan that the delegates agreed to was neither ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown. Nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence.\\r\\nThe British formed an aggressive plan of operations for 1755. General Braddock was to lead the expedition to Fort Duquesne,[48] while Massachusetts governor William Shirley was given the task of fortifying Fort Oswego and attacking Fort Niagara, and Sir William Johnson was to capture Fort St. Frdric at present-day Crown Point, New York.[49] Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton was to capture Fort Beausjour to the east, on the frontier between Nova Scotia and Acadia.[50]\\r\\nBraddock led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne, with George Washington as one of his aides. The expedition was a disaster. It was attacked by French soldiers and Indian warriors ambushing them from up in trees and behind logs, and Braddock called for a retreat. He was killed and approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured.[48] The remaining 500 British troops retreated to Virginia, led by George Washington. Two future opponents in the American Revolutionary War played key roles in organizing the retreat: Washington and Thomas Gage.\\r\\nThe French acquired a copy of the British war plans, including the activities of Shirley and Johnson. Shirley's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties, exacerbated by his inexperience in managing large expeditions. In conjunction, Shirley was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence when he planned to attack Fort Niagara. As a response, he left garrisons at Oswego, Fort Bull, and Fort Williams, the last two located on the Oneida Carry between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek at present-day Rome, New York. Supplies were cached at Fort Bull for use in the projected attack on Niagara.\\r\\nJohnson's expedition was better organized than Shirley's, which was noticed by New France's governor the Marquis de Vaudreuil. He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio, and he had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley's expected attack. Vaudreuil saw Johnson as the larger threat and sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frdric to meet that threat. Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River, but Johnson had strongly fortified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack. The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry. The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759).\\r\\nColonel Monckton captured Fort Beausjour in June 1755 in the sole British success that year, cutting off the French fortress at Louisbourg from land-based reinforcements. To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia's Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area. Monckton's forces, including companies of Rogers' Rangers, forcibly removed thousands of Acadians, chasing down many who resisted and sometimes committing atrocities. More than any other factor, cutting off supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise.[51] The Acadian resistance was sometimes quite stiff, in concert with Indian allies including the Mi'kmaq, with ongoing frontier raids against Dartmouth and Lunenburg, among others. The only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757, other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians ranging around the Bay of Fundy, on the Petitcodiac and St. John rivers, and ?le Saint-Jean.\\r\\nFollowing the death of Braddock, William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America, and he laid out his plans for 1756 at a meeting in Albany in December 1755. He proposed renewing the efforts to capture Niagara, Crown Point, and Duquesne, with attacks on Fort Frontenac on the north shore of Lake Ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudire River to attack the city of Quebec. His plan, however, got bogged down by disagreements and disputes with others, including William Johnson and New York's Governor Sir Charles Hardy, and consequently gained little support.\\r\\nNewcastle replaced him in January 1756 with Lord Loudoun, with Major General James Abercrombie as his second in command. Neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers whom France sent to North America.[47] French regular army reinforcements arrived in New France in May 1756, led by Major General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and seconded by the Chevalier de Lvis and Colonel Fran?ois-Charles de Bourlamaque, all experienced veterans from the War of the Austrian Succession. On May 18, 1756, England formally declared war on France, which expanded the war into Europe and came to be known as the Seven Years' War.\\r\\nGovernor Vaudreuil had ambitions to become the French commander in chief, in addition to his role as governor, and he acted during the winter of 1756 before those reinforcements arrived. Scouts had reported the weakness of the British supply chain, so he ordered an attack against the forts which Shirley had erected at the Oneida Carry. In the Battle of Fort Bull, French forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies, including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder. They set back any British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario and endangered the Oswego garrison, already short on supplies. French forces in the Ohio valley also continued to intrigue with Indians throughout the area, encouraging them to raid frontier settlements. This led to ongoing alarms along the western frontiers, with streams of refugees returning east to get away from the action.\\r\\nThe new British command was not in place until July. Abercrombie arrived in Albany but refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them, and Montcalm took bold action against his inertia. He built on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison and executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga, as if to presage another attack along Lake George. With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August. In the aftermath, Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects. The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables, which angered the Indians.\\r\\nLoudoun was a capable administrator but a cautious field commander, and he planned one major operation for 1757: an attack on New France's capital of Quebec. He left a sizable force at Fort William Henry to distract Montcalm and began organizing for the expedition to Quebec. He was then ordered to attack Louisbourg first by William Pitt, the Secretary of State responsible for the colonies. The expedition was beset by delays of all kinds but was finally ready to sail from Halifax, Nova Scotia in early August. In the meantime, French ships had escaped the British blockade of the French coast, and a fleet awaited Loudoun at Louisbourg which outnumbered the British fleet. Faced with this strength, Loudoun returned to New York amid news that a massacre had occurred at Fort William Henry.\\r\\nFrench irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians) harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757. In January, they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga. In February, they launched a raid against the position across the frozen Lake George, destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification. In early August, Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort, which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole. When the withdrawal began, some of Montcalm's Indian allies attacked the British column because they were angry about the lost opportunity for loot, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves. The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations, as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward. Modern writer William Nester believes that the Indians might have been exposed to European carriers, although no proof exists.[52]\\r\\nVaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758, as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping. The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of Fran?ois Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western Indian tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. The disease probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle;[53] yet the Indians blamed the French for bringing \\"bad medicine\\" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry.\\r\\nMontcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg, while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years.[54] The British failures in North America combined with other failures in the European theater and led to Newcastle's fall from power along with the Duke of Cumberland, his principal military advisor.\\r\\nNewcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning. He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun. He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757. Pitt's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France. Two of the expeditions were successful, with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces.\\r\\nThe Forbes Expedition was a British campaign in SeptemberÿOctober 1758, with 6,000 troops led by General John Forbes sent to drive out the French from the contested Ohio Country. The French withdrew from Fort Duquesne and left the British in control of the Ohio River Valley.[55] The great French fortress at Louisbourg in Nova Scotia was captured after a siege.[56]\\r\\nThe third invasion was stopped with the improbable French victory in the Battle of Carillon, in which 3,600 Frenchmen defeated Abercrombie's force of 18,000 regulars, militia, and Indian allies outside the fort which the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga. Abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent John Bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac, including caches of supplies destined for New France's western forts and furs destined for Europe. Abercrombie was recalled and replaced by Jeffery Amherst, victor at Louisbourg.\\r\\nThe French had generally poor results in 1758 in most theaters of the war. The new foreign minister was the duc de Choiseul, and he decided to focus on an invasion of Britain to draw British resources away from North America and the European mainland. The invasion failed both militarily and politically, as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France and sent funds to Britain's mainland ally of Prussia, while the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay. In one piece of good fortune, some French supply ships did manage to depart France and elude the British blockade of the French coast.\\r\\nBritish victories continued in all theaters in the Annus Mirabilis of 1759: the British captured Ticonderoga, James Wolfe defeated Montcalm at Quebec in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders, and a British victory at Fort Niagara cut off the French frontier forts to the west and south. The victory was made complete in 1760; the British did suffer a defeat outside Quebec City in the Battle of Sainte-Foy, but they prevented the arrival of French relief ships in the naval Battle of the Restigouche while armies marched on Montreal from three sides.\\r\\nGovernor Vaudreuil in Montreal negotiated a capitulation with General Amherst in September 1760. Amherst granted his requests that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition, to own property, and to remain undisturbed in their homes. The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers, and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war.[57]\\r\\nMost of the fighting ended in continental North America in 1760, although it continued in Europe between France and Britain. The notable exception was the French seizure of St. John's, Newfoundland. General Amherst heard of this surprise action and immediately dispatched troops under his nephew William Amherst, who regained control of Newfoundland after the Battle of Signal Hill in September 1762.[58] Many troops from North America were reassigned to participate in further British actions in the West Indies, including the capture of Spanish Havana when Spain belatedly entered the conflict on the side of France, and a British expedition against French Martinique in 1762 led by Major General Robert Monckton.[59]\\r\\nGeneral Amherst also oversaw the transition of French forts to British control in the western lands. The policies which he introduced in those lands disturbed large numbers of Indians and contributed to Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763.[60] This series of attacks on frontier forts and settlements required the continued deployment of British troops, and it was not resolved until 1766.[61]\\r\\nThe war in North America officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763, and war in the European theater was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763. The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British. France chose to cede the former but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow. The British, however, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue; they also had ample places from which to obtain sugar. Spain traded Florida to Britain in order to regain Cuba, but they also gained Louisiana from France, including New Orleans, in compensation for their losses. Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations.[62]\\r\\nThe war changed economic, political, governmental, and social relations among the three European powers, their colonies, and the people who inhabited those territories. France and Britain both suffered financially because of the war, with significant long-term consequences.\\r\\nBritain gained control of French Canada and Acadia, colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents. The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 made land available to immigrants from Europe and migrants from the colonies to the south. The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces, but many went to France, and some went to New Orleans, which they had expected to remain French. Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands, but these efforts were unsuccessful. Others migrated to places such as Saint-Domingue or fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution. The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population. (The French word \\"Acadien\\" changed to \\"Cadien\\" then to \\"Cajun\\".)[63]\\r\\nFollowing the treaty, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763 which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and it continues to govern relations to some extent between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population,[64] a demarcation that was only a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers.[65] The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians.[66] The Quebec Act addressed this and other issues in 1774, raising concerns in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \\"popery.\\" The Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution.\\r\\nThe Seven Years' War nearly doubled Great Britain's national debt. The Crown sought sources of revenue to pay it off and attempted to impose new taxes on its colonies. These attempts were met with increasingly stiff resistance, until troops were called in to enforce the Crown's authority. These acts ultimately led to the start of the American Revolutionary War.[67]\\r\\nFrance attached comparatively little value to its North American possessions, apart from the highly profitable sugar-producing Antilles islands which it retained. Minister Choiseul considered that he had made a good deal at the Treaty of Paris, and Voltaire wrote that Louis XV had lost \\"a few acres of snow\\".[68] For France, however, the military defeat and the financial burden of the war weakened the monarchy and contributed to the advent of the French Revolution in 1789.[69]\\r\\nFor some of the Indian tribes, the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally, although other tribes were not so affected.[69] The Ohio Country was now more available to colonial settlement, due to the construction of military roads by Braddock and Forbes.[70] The Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory was not completed until 1769, and it had modest repercussions. The British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of Indian tribes who did not want to do business with them. This migration also caused a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies who were now competing for land.[71] The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave. Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine, although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico.[72]\\r\\nFrance returned to North America in 1778 with the establishment of a Franco-American alliance against Great Britain in the American War of Independence. This time, France succeeded in prevailing over Great Britain in what historian Alfred A. Cave describes as \\"French revenge for Montcalm's death\\".[73]","input":"The french and indian war was fought over disputed land. what was the land?"},{"output":"Paul Penzone","context":"The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) is a local law enforcement agency that serves Maricopa County, Arizona.

Its ongoing practices are highly controversial, to which it has received national and international media coverage, along with a number of federal investigations and other controversies under former sheriff Joe Arpaio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MCSO does not possess a legal identity separate from Maricopa County. Deputy Sheriffs of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office are delegated their law enforcement authority by the Sheriff of Maricopa County.[4]\\r\\nMaricopa County is the fourth largest county in the United States, and has a total area of 9,224 square miles (23,900?km2). The county is currently divided into six geographical areas, referred to as Districts, and consist of District 1, District 2, District 3, District 4, District 6, and District 7. Districts are generally staffed by a District Commander (Captain), Deputy Commander (Lieutenant), uniformed sergeants and patrol deputies, detectives, and administrative staff. Districts overlap city agencies, as the Sheriff's Office has concurrent jurisdiction in these areas.\\r\\nDistrict 1 ÿ covers an area of approximately 1,053 square miles (2,730?km2) in the southeast quadrant of the county. District One encompasses the cities of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, and Tempe, along with the Town of Guadalupe and CDP of Sun Lakes. District One also includes portions of the Town of Queen Creek, and the cities of Apache Junction, Scottsdale, and Phoenix, including the Ahwatukee Foothills. While District One is not the largest district in size, it is historically the busiest, averaging approximately 40% more calls for service than any of the other districts.\\r\\nDistrict 2 ÿ covers an area of approximately 5,200 square miles (13,000?km2) in the southwest quadrant of the county. District Two provides service to the rural areas of Buckeye, Laveen, Mobile, Rainbow Valley, and Tonopah, as well as to the contract cities of Gila Bend and Litchfield Park. District Two also includes portions of Avondale, Glendale, Goodyear, and Phoenix.\\r\\nDistrict 3 ÿ covers an area of approximately 1,600 square miles (4,100?km2), bordered by Northern Avenue on the south and I-17 on the east, extending to the northern and western borders of the county. District Three includes the areas of Sun City and Sun City West, the communities of Wittmann, Waddell, Circle City, Morristown, Whispering Ranch, Aguila, Gladden, and the unincorporated neighborhoods surrounding Peoria, Surprise, and Wickenburg.\\r\\nDistrict 4 ÿ covers the unincorporated areas of Anthem, Desert Foothills, New River, Cave Creek, Carefree and Tonto Hills. District Four also provides law enforcement to the contract Towns of Cave Creek and Carefree.\\r\\nDistrict 6 ÿ covers, on a contract basis, the Town of Queen Creek. The Town of Queen Creek was previously a part of District One, but was officially designated as its own district in 2008, with its own complement of deputies and command staff. There continues to be, however, several unincorporated neighborhoods in and around Queen Creek that are still serviced by District One. Portions of the corporate town limits of Queen Creek fall within the jurisdictional boundaries of Pinal County, but are provided law enforcement services by Maricopa County.\\r\\nDistrict 7 ÿ covers the unincorporated areas of Fountain Hills, Tonto Verde and Rio Verde. It also provides contract law enforcement services on a contract basis to the Town of Fountain Hills.\\r\\nThe following insignia are respective of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office Uniform Specification policy GC-20. Detectives & Deputies are the same rank. Detective is not a promotion within MCSO it's just a different assignment.[5]\\r\\nLake Patrol\\r\\nIn addition to patrolling the unincorporated areas, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office is responsible for patrolling the lakes and waterways in the recreational areas within the county. The Lake Patrol Division is responsible for law enforcement services in the recreational areas of Tonto National Forest and Lake Pleasant Regional Park. This area includes Saguaro, Canyon, Apache, Bartlett and Horseshoe Lakes as well as the Lower Salt and Verde River recreational areas, Four Peaks, Superstition, Mazatzals, Camp Creek and Seven Springs recreational and wilderness areas. The total area of responsibility is over 1,000 square miles (2,600?km2), which are visited by an estimated 1.5 million people every year.\\r\\nLake Patrol Division deputy sheriffs operate four-wheel-drive vehicles, all-terrain vehicles, patrol boats, jet skis and an air boat. All are certified Emergency Medical Technicians and several are Paramedics. The division also has a detective section which investigates crimes, deaths and boating accidents on the lakes and rivers.\\r\\nTrails Division\\r\\nThe Trails Division has the responsibility for law enforcement services in the recreational and wilderness areas of the Maricopa County Parks. The total area of responsibility consists of over 120,000 acres (490?km2) that are visited by approximately 1.8 million persons each year. The Maricopa County parks system is the largest regional parks system in the nation, and includes the areas of Buckeye Hills Recreation area, Cave Creek Regional Park, Estrella Mountain Regional Park, Lake Pleasant Regional Park, McDowell Mountain Regional Park, San Tan Mountain Regional Park, Spur Cross Ranch Conservation Area, The Desert Outdoor Center at Lake Pleasant, Usery Mountain Regional Park, and White Tank Mountain Regional Park.\\r\\nThe Trails Division deputies operate four-wheel drive vehicles and all-terrain vehicles, and also uses bicycles, mounted, and foot patrols.\\r\\nAviation Division\\r\\nThe Aviation Division provides airborne law enforcement support to uniformed patrol, Lake Patrol, Search and Rescue operations, narcotics enforcement, extraditions and SWAT operations.\\r\\nThe Aviation Division is staffed with a Commander, Helicopter Flight Operation Supervisor, Fixed Wing Supervisor, Director of Maintenance, fourteen sworn Deputies, five Civilians, two instructor pilots and an Administrative Coordinator. The Division is a 24-hour-a-day 7 days a week operation and employs four helicopters and two fixed-wing aircraft.\\r\\nThe flagship of the division is a Bell 407 helicopter with a call sign of \\"FOX 1.\\" This helicopter is equipped with FLIR (Forward Looking Infra Red), stabilized binoculars, Ultichart moving map and an SX-5 night sun spotlight. This helicopter performs direct patrol, search and rescue operations, narcotics surveillance and photo missions.\\r\\nIn addition \\"FOX-1\\", the Aviation Division operates \\"FOX 4,\\" a Bell Military OH-58 helicopter acquired in 1996 from the Defense Reutilization Program. It was completely rebuilt and placed into service in July 1998, and is also used for direct patrol, search and rescue operations, narcotics surveillance and photo missions.\\r\\n\\"FOX 5\\" is a Schweitzer TH-55 helicopter acquired from the Defense Reutilization Program. \\"FOX-5\\" has been fully restored and is the primary training aircraft for MCSO Aviation personnel. This is the same type of aircraft used by the military to train pilots since the 1960s.\\r\\nFor fixed wing, the division utilizes a single engine Cessna 206 and a twin engine PA-31 Piper Navajo. Both aircraft are housed at Glendale Airport and are used primarily for extraditing fugitives from other states. Fixed wing aircraft are also used for narcotics and smuggling surveillance missions.\\r\\nK9 Unit\\r\\nThe Sheriff's Canine Unit includes 25 canines with various specialties, including narcotics, explosive ordnance, cadaver, and patrol. The unit's staff consists of one Sergeant, ten Deputies, five Detectives and four Detention Officers.\\r\\nAll canines trained in narcotic detection are capable of finding and aggressively alerting on cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamines, heroin, and their derivatives. Collectively, they have assisted in the seizure of over 5.3 million dollars in narcotic tainted monies. All canines trained in explosive ordnance detection are trained to detect and passively alert on 13 different odors. The tobacco canine is trained to find and aggressively alert on all forms of tobacco.\\r\\nPatrol dogs are trained in building searches, area searches, officer protection, crowd control, trailing, and provide a strong psychological deterrent to certain types of criminal misconduct. Our cadaver canine is trained to find and passively alert on decaying human tissues, bones, and fluids. Our bloodhounds are utilized to track down suspects and locate missing or lost individuals.\\r\\nCanine team members typically work patrol operations during peak activity hours, usually from about 6 PM to 4 AM. They also augment SWAT operations; provide contractual services for narcotic detection at several local schools; provide narcotic and explosive ordnance detection for not only our office, but for other local, state, and federal agencies; they are on call 7 days a week 24 hours a day, and conduct over 100 public relations demonstrations annually.\\r\\nThe utilization of police canines provides law enforcement with a non-lethal means of apprehending dangerous criminal offenders; detecting intruders and alerting handlers to their presence; pursuing, attacking and holding criminal offenders who resist apprehension; searching and clearing buildings and large open areas for criminals; tracking lost children or other persons; detecting the presence of certain narcotics, explosives, and tobacco products; locating deceased subjects, crime scenes, and minute physical evidence; and provide a strong psychological deterrent to certain types of criminal misconduct.\\r\\nThere is a permanent, organized Sheriff's Posse that provides civilian volunteer support to the sworn deputies of the Sheriff's Office. Dozens of individual posse units can be called upon for various needs, such as a Jeep posse, equine mounted units in various cities, a ham radio operator posse, a diver's posse, and an air posse of licensed pilots.\\r\\nSince the establishment of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, 17 officers have died in the line of duty.[6]\\r\\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff's Office has been involved in many controversial acts, lawsuits, and other operations that have been called into question, from alleged racial profiling to jail conditions. Former Maricopa County Sheriff, Joe Arpaio, has also been criticized over a number of incidents and policies.\\r\\nThe United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division is investigating the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in relation to alleged racism and abuse of power, as well as refusing to cooperate with a federal Justice Department investigation.[7]\\r\\nMaricopa County Sheriff's Office is also featured on TLC's television program Police Women of Maricopa County (2010).[8]","input":"Who is the current sheriff of maricopa county arizona?"},{"output":"Dave Vanian (born David Lett","context":"The Damned\\r\\nDavid Vanian & the Phantom Chords\\r\\nNaz Nomad and the Nightmares\\r\\nDave Vanian (born David Lett, 12 October 1956) is a rock musician and lead singer of the punk rock band The Damned.

The products are organic acids, gases, or alcohol. It occurs in yeast and bacteria, and also in oxygen-starved muscle cells, as in the case of lactic acid fermentation. The science of fermentation is known as zymology.\\r\\nIn microorganisms, fermentation is the primary means of producing ATP by the degradation of organic nutrients anaerobically.[1] Humans have used fermentation to produce foodstuffs and beverages since the Neolithic age. For example, fermentation is used for preservation in a process that produces lactic acid as found in such sour foods as pickled cucumbers, kimchi and yogurt (see fermentation in food processing), as well as for producing alcoholic beverages such as wine (see fermentation in winemaking) and beer. Fermentation occurs within the gastrointestinal tracts of all animals, including humans.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow are some definitions of fermentation. They range from informal, general usages to more scientific definitions.[3]\\r\\nAlong with photosynthesis and aerobic respiration, fermentation is a way of extracting energy from molecules, but it is the only one common to all bacteria and eukaryotes. It is therefore considered the oldest metabolic pathway, suitable for an environment that did not yet have oxygen.[4]:389 Yeast, a form of fungus, occurs in almost any environment capable of supporting microbes, from the skins of fruits to the guts of insects and mammals and the deep ocean, and they harvest sugar-rich materials to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide.[5][6]\\r\\nThe basic mechanism for fermentation remains present in all cells of higher organisms. Mammalian muscle carries out the fermentation that occurs during periods of intense exercise where oxygen supply becomes limited, resulting in the creation of lactic acid.[7]:63 In invertebrates, fermentation also produces succinate and alanine.[8]:141\\r\\nFermentative bacteria play an essential role in the production of methane in habitats ranging from the rumens of cattle to sewage digesters and freshwater sediments. They produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide, formate and acetate and carboxylic acids; and then consortia of microbes convert the carbon dioxide and acetate to methane. Acetogenic bacteria oxidize the acids, obtaining more acetate and either hydrogen or formate. Finally, methanogens (which are in the domain Archea) convert acetate to methane.[9]\\r\\nFermentation reacts NADH with an endogenous, organic electron acceptor.[1] Usually this is pyruvate formed from sugar through glycolysis. The reaction produces NAD+ and an organic product, typical examples being ethanol, lactic acid, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen gas (H2). However, more exotic compounds can be produced by fermentation, such as butyric acid and acetone. Fermentation products contain chemical energy (they are not fully oxidized), but are considered waste products, since they cannot be metabolized further without the use of oxygen.\\r\\nFermentation normally occurs in an anaerobic environment. In the presence of O2, NADH and pyruvate are used to generate ATP in respiration. This is called oxidative phosphorylation, and it generates much more ATP than glycolysis alone. For that reason, fermentation is rarely utilized when oxygen is available. However, even in the presence of abundant oxygen, some strains of yeast such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae prefer fermentation to aerobic respiration as long as there is an adequate supply of sugars (a phenomenon known as the Crabtree effect).[11] Some fermentation processes involve obligate anaerobes, which cannot tolerate oxygen.\\r\\nAlthough yeast carries out the fermentation in the production of ethanol in beers, wines, and other alcoholic drinks, this is not the only possible agent: bacteria carry out the fermentation in the production of xanthan gum.\\r\\nIn ethanol fermentation, one glucose molecule is converted into two ethanol molecules and two carbon dioxide molecules.[12][13] It is used to make bread dough rise: the carbon dioxide forms bubbles, expanding the dough into a foam.[14][15] The ethanol is the intoxicating agent in alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer and liquor.[16] Fermentation of feedstocks including sugarcane, corn and sugar beets produces ethanol that is added to gasoline.[17] In some species of fish, including goldfish and carp, it provides energy when oxygen is scarce (along with lactic acid fermentation).[18]\\r\\nThe figure illustrates the process. Before fermentation, a glucose molecule breaks down into two pyruvate molecules. The energy from this exothermic reaction is used to bind inorganic phosphates to ATP and convert NAD+ to NADH. The pyruvates break down into two acetaldehyde molecules and give off two carbon dioxide molecules as a waste product. The acetaldehyde is reduced into ethanol using the energy and hydrogen from NADH and the NADH is oxidized into NAD+ so that the cycle may repeat. The reaction is catalysed by the enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase.[12]\\r\\nHomolactic fermentation (producing only lactic acid) is the simplest type of fermentation. The pyruvate from glycolysis[19] undergoes a simple redox reaction, forming lactic acid.[20][21] It is unique because it is one of the only respiration processes to not produce a gas as a byproduct. Overall, one molecule of glucose (or any six-carbon sugar) is converted to two molecules of lactic acid:\\r\\nIt occurs in the muscles of animals when they need energy faster than the blood can supply oxygen. It also occurs in some kinds of bacteria (such as lactobacilli) and some fungi. It is the type of bacteria that converts lactose into lactic acid in yogurt, giving it its sour taste. These lactic acid bacteria can carry out either homolactic fermentation, where the end-product is mostly lactic acid, or\\r\\nHeterolactic fermentation, where some lactate is further metabolized and results in ethanol and carbon dioxide[20] (via the phosphoketolase pathway), acetate, or other metabolic products, e.g.:\\r\\nIf lactose is fermented (as in yogurts and cheeses), it is first converted into glucose and galactose (both six-carbon sugars with the same atomic formula):\\r\\nHeterolactic fermentation is in a sense intermediate between lactic acid fermentation, and other types, e.g. alcoholic fermentation (see below). The reasons to go further and convert lactic acid into anything else are:\\r\\nHydrogen gas is produced in many types of fermentation (mixed acid fermentation, butyric acid fermentation, caproate fermentation, butanol fermentation, glyoxylate fermentation), as a way to regenerate NAD+ from NADH. Electrons are transferred to ferredoxin, which in turn is oxidized by hydrogenase, producing H2.[12] Hydrogen gas is a substrate for methanogens and sulfate reducers, which keep the concentration of hydrogen low and favor the production of such an energy-rich compound,[22] but hydrogen gas at a fairly high concentration can nevertheless be formed, as in flatus.\\r\\nAs an example of mixed acid fermentation, bacteria such as Clostridium pasteurianum ferment glucose producing butyrate, acetate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas:[23] The reaction leading to acetate is:\\r\\nGlucose could theoretically be converted into just CO2 and H2, but the global reaction releases little energy.\\r\\nMost industrial fermentation uses batch or fed-batch procedures, although continuous fermentation can be more economical if various challenges, particularly the difficulty of maintaining sterility, can be met.[24]\\r\\nIn a batch process, all the ingredients are combined and the reactions proceed without any further input. Batch fermentation has been used for millennia to make bread and alcoholic beverages, and it is still a common method, especially when the process is not well understood.[25]:1 However, it can be expensive because the fermentor must be sterilized using high pressure steam between batches.[24] Strictly speaking, there is often addition of small quantities of chemicals to control the pH or suppress foaming.[25]:25\\r\\nBatch fermentation goes through a series of phases. There is a lag phase in which cells adjust to their environment; then a phase in which exponential growth occurs. Once many of the nutrients have been consumed, the growth slows and becomes non-exponential, but production of secondary metabolites (including commercially important antibiotics and enzymes) accelerates. This continues through a stationary phase after most of the nutrients have been consumed, and then the cells die.[25]:25\\r\\nFed-batch fermentation is a variation of batch fermentation where some of the ingredients are added during the fermentation. This allows greater control over the stages of the process. In particular, production of secondary metabolites can be increased by adding a limited quantity of nutrients during the non-exponential growth phase. Fed-batch operations are often sandwiched between batch operations.[25]:1[26]\\r\\nThe high cost of sterilizing the fermentor between batches can be avoided using various open fermentation approaches that are able to resist contamination. One is to use a naturally evolved mixed culture. This is particularly favored in wastewater treatment, since mixed populations can adapt to a wide variety of wastes. Thermophilic bacteria can produce lactic acid at temperatures of around 50 degrees Celsius, sufficient to discourage microbial contamination; and ethanol has been produced at a temperature of 70C. This is just below its boiling point (78C), making it easy to extract. Halophilic bacteria can produce bioplastics in hypersaline conditions. Solid-state fermentation adds a small amount of water to a solid substrate; it is widely used in the food industry to produce flavors, enzymes and organic acids.[24]\\r\\nIn continuous fermentation, substrates are added and final products removed continuously.[24] There are three varieties: chemostats, which hold nutrient levels constant; turbidostats, which keep cell mass constant; and plug flow reactors in which the culture medium flows steadily through a tube while the cells are recycled from the outlet to the inlet.[26] If the process works well, there is a steady flow of feed and effluent and the costs of repeatedly setting up a batch are avoided. Also, it can prolong the exponential growth phase and avoid byproducts that inhibit the reactions by continuously removing them. However, it is difficult to maintain a steady state and avoid contamination, and the design tends to be complex.[24] Typically the fermentor must run for over 500 hours to be more economical than batch processors.[26]\\r\\nThe use of fermentation, particularly for beverages, has existed since the Neolithic and has been documented dating from 7000ÿ6600 BCE in Jiahu, China,[27] 5000 BCE in India, Ayurveda mentions many Medicated Wines, 6000 BCE in Georgia,[28] 3150 BCE in ancient Egypt,[29] 3000 BCE in Babylon,[30] 2000 BCE in pre-Hispanic Mexico,[30] and 1500 BC in Sudan.[31] Fermented foods have a religious significance in Judaism and Christianity. The Baltic god Rugutis was worshiped as the agent of fermentation.[32][33]\\r\\nIn 1837, Charles Cagniard de la Tour, Theodor Schwann and Friedrich Traugott Ktzing independently published papers concluding, as a result of microscopic investigations, that yeast is a living organism that reproduces by budding.[34][35]:6 Schwann boiled grape juice to kill the yeast and found that no fermentation would occur until new yeast was added. However, a lot of chemists , including Antoine Lavoisier, continued to view fermentation as a simple chemical reaction and rejected the notion that living organisms could be involved. This was seen as a reversion to vitalism, and was lampooned in an anonymous publication by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich W?hler.[4]:108ÿ109\\r\\nThe turning point came when Louis Pasteur (1822ÿ1895), during the 1850s and 1860s, repeated Schwann's experiments and showed that fermentation is initiated by living organisms in a series of investigations.[21][35]:6 In 1857, Pasteur showed that lactic acid fermentation is caused by living organisms.[36] In 1860, he demonstrated that bacteria cause souring in milk, a process formerly thought to be merely a chemical change, and his work in identifying the role of microorganisms in food spoilage led to the process of pasteurization.[37] In 1877, working to improve the French brewing industry, Pasteur published his famous paper on fermentation, \\"Etudes sur la Bire\\", which was translated into English in 1879 as \\"Studies on fermentation\\".[38] He defined fermentation (incorrectly) as \\"Life without air\\",[39] but correctly showed that specific types of microorganisms cause specific types of fermentations and specific end-products.\\r\\nAlthough showing fermentation to be the result of the action of living microorganisms was a breakthrough, it did not explain the basic nature of the fermentation process, or prove that it is caused by the microorganisms that appear to be always present. Many scientists, including Pasteur, had unsuccessfully attempted to extract the fermentation enzyme from yeast.[39] Success came in 1897 when the German chemist Eduard Buechner ground up yeast, extracted a juice from them, then found to his amazement that this \\"dead\\" liquid would ferment a sugar solution, forming carbon dioxide and alcohol much like living yeasts.[40] Buechner's results are considered to mark the birth of biochemistry. The \\"unorganized ferments\\" behaved just like the organized ones. From that time on, the term enzyme came to be applied to all ferments. It was then understood that fermentation is caused by enzymes that are produced by microorganisms.[41] In 1907, Buechner won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work.[42]\\r\\nAdvances in microbiology and fermentation technology have continued steadily up until the present. For example, in the 1930s, it was discovered that microorganisms could be mutated with physical and chemical treatments to be higher-yielding, faster-growing, tolerant of less oxygen, and able to use a more concentrated medium.[43] Strain selection and hybridization developed as well, affecting most modern food fermentations.\\r\\nThe word \\"ferment\\" is derived from the Latin verb fervere, which means to boil. It is thought to have been first used in the late 14th century in alchemy, but only in a broad sense. It was not used in the modern scientific sense until around 1600.","input":"What type of gas is produced during fermentation?"},{"output":"tobacco","context":"Jamestown was the first settlement of the Virginia Colony, founded in 1607, and served as capital of Virginia until 1699, when the seat of government was moved to Williamsburg. This article covers the history of the fort and town at Jamestown proper, as well as colony-wide trends resulting from and affecting the town during the time period in which it was capital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVirginia Company of London sent an expedition to establish a settlement in the Virginia Colony in December 1606. The expedition consisted of three ships, Susan Constant (sometimes known as Sarah Constant), Godspeed, and Discovery. The Discovery was the smallest ship; the largest ship, the Susan Constant, was captained by Christopher Newport. The ships left Blackwall, now part of London, with 105 men and boys and 39 crew-members.[1][2]\\r\\nBy April 6, 1607, Godspeed, Susan Constant and Discovery arrived at the Spanish colony of Puerto Rico, where they stopped for provisions before continuing their journey. In April 1607, the expedition reached the southern edge of the mouth of what is now known as the Chesapeake Bay. After an unusually long journey of more than four months, the 104 men and boys (one passenger of the original 105 died during the journey) arrived at their chosen settlement spot in Virginia.[3] There were no women on the first ships.[4]\\r\\nArriving at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay in late April, they named the Virginia capes after the sons of their king, the southern Cape Henry, for Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and the northern Cape Charles, for his younger brother, Charles, Duke of York. On April 26, 1607, upon landing at Cape Henry, Chaplain Robert Hunt offered a prayer, and they set up a cross near the site of the current Cape Henry Memorial. This site came to be known as the \\"first landing.\\" A party of the men explored the area and had a minor conflict with some Virginia Indians.[5]\\r\\nAfter the expedition arrived in what is now Virginia, sealed orders from the Virginia Company were opened. These orders named Captain John Smith as a member of the governing Council. Smith had been arrested for mutiny during the voyage and was incarcerated aboard one of the ships. He had been scheduled to be hanged upon arrival, but was freed by Captain Newport after the opening of the orders. The same orders also directed the expedition to seek an inland site for their settlement, which would afford protection from enemy ships.\\r\\nObedient to their orders, the settlers and crewmembers re-boarded their three ships and proceeded into the Chesapeake Bay. They landed again at what is now called Old Point Comfort in the City of Hampton. In the following days, seeking a suitable location for their settlement, the ships ventured upstream along the James River. Both the James River and the settlement they sought to establish, Jamestown (originally called \\"James His Towne\\") were named in honor of King James I.\\r\\nOn May 14, 1607, the colonists chose Jamestown Island for their settlement pretty much because the Virginia Company advised them to select a location that could be easily defended from attacks by other European states that were also establishing New World colonies and were periodically at war with England, notably the Dutch Republic, France, and Spain.\\r\\nThe island fit the criteria as it had excellent visibility up and down the James River, and it was far enough inland to minimize the potential of contact and conflict with enemy ships. The water immediately adjacent to the land was deep enough to permit the colonists to anchor their ships, yet have an easy and quick departure if necessary. An additional benefit of the site was that the land was not occupied by the Virginia Indians, most of whom were affiliated with the Powhatan Confederacy. Largely cut off from the mainland, the shallow harbor afforded the earliest settlers docking of their ships. This was its greatest attraction, but it also created a number of challenging problems for the settlers.\\r\\nThe settlers came ashore and quickly set about constructing their initial fort. Despite the immediate area of Jamestown being uninhabited, the settlers were attacked less than two weeks after their arrival on May 14, by Paspahegh Indians who succeeded in killing one of the settlers and wounding eleven more. Within a month, James Fort covered an acre on Jamestown Island. The wooden palisaded walls formed a triangle around a storehouse, church, and a number of houses. The fort burned down the following year.[6]\\r\\nIt soon became apparent why the Virginia Indians did not occupy the site: Jamestown Island, then a peninsula, is a swampy area, and its isolation from the mainland meant that there was limited hunting available, as most game animals required larger foraging areas. The settlers quickly hunted and killed off all the large and smaller game animals that were found on the tiny peninsula. In addition, the low, marshy area was infested with airborne pests, including mosquitoes, which carried malaria, and the brackish water of the tidal James River was not a good source of water. Over 135 settlers died from malaria, and drinking the salinated and contaminated water caused many to suffer from saltwater poisoning, fevers, and dysentery.\\r\\nKing James I had outlined the members of the Council to govern the settlement in the sealed orders which left London with the colonists in 1606.[7]\\r\\nThose named for the initial Council were:\\r\\nThe Council received additional members from the First and Second Supply missions brought by Captain Newport. These were:\\r\\nAlso notable among the first settlers was:\\r\\nMany of the settlers who came over on the initial three ships were not well-equipped for the life they found in Jamestown. A number of the original settlers were upper-class gentlemen who were not accustomed to manual labor; the group included very few farmers or skilled laborers.[8] The climate, location, and makeup of the settlement resulted in many settlers dying of disease and starvation.\\r\\nBy June 15, the settlers finished building the triangular James Fort. A week later, Newport sailed back for London on Susan Constant with a load of pyrite (\\"fools gold\\") and other supposedly precious minerals, leaving behind 104 colonists and Discovery. Newport returned twice from England with additional supplies in the following 18 months, leading what were termed the First and Second Supply missions.\\r\\nThe \\"First Supply\\" arrived on January 2, 1608. It contained insufficient provisions and more than 70 new colonists.[9] Despite original intentions to grow food and trade with the Virginia Indians, the barely surviving colonists became dependent upon supply missions.\\r\\nOn October 1, 1608, 70 new settlers arrived aboard the English \\"Mary and Margaret\\" with the Second Supply, following a journey of approximately three months. Included in the Second Supply were Thomas Graves, Thomas Forrest, Esq and \\"Mistress Forrest and Anne Burras her maide.\\" Mistress Forrest and Anne Burras were the first two women known to have come to the Jamestown Colony. Remains unearthed at Jamestown in 1997 may be those of Mistress Forrest.[10]\\r\\nAlso included on the Second Supply were the first non-English settlers. The company recruited these as skilled craftsmen and industry specialists: soap-ash, glass, lumber milling (wainscot, clapboard, and deal  planks, especially soft wood planks) and naval stores (pitch, turpentine, and tar).[11][12][13][14][15][16] Among these additional settlers were eight \\"Dutch-men\\" (consisting of unnamed craftsmen and three who were probably the wood-mill-men  Adam, Franz and Samuel) \\"Dutch-men\\" (probably meaning German or German-speakers),[17] Polish and Slovak craftsmen,[11][12][13][14][15][16] who had been hired by the Virginia Company of London's leaders to help develop and manufacture profitable export products. There has been debate about the nationality of the specific craftsmen, and both the Germans and Poles claim the glassmaker for one of their own, but the evidence is insufficient.[18] Ethnicity is further complicated by the fact that the German minority in Royal Prussia lived under Polish control during this period. These workers staged the first recorded strike in Colonial America for the right to vote in the colony's 1619 election.\\r\\nWilliam Volday/Wilhelm Waldi, a Swiss German mineral prospector, was also among those who arrived in 1608. His mission was seeking a silver reservoir that was believed to be within the proximity of Jamestown.[19] Some of the settlers were artisans who built a glass furnace which became the first proto-factory in British North America. Additional craftsmen produced soap, pitch, and wood building supplies. Among all of these were the first made-in-America products to be exported to Europe.[20] However, despite all these efforts, profits from exports were not sufficient to meet the expenses and expectations of the investors back in England, and no silver or gold had been discovered, as earlier hoped.\\r\\nThe investors of the Virginia Company of London expected to reap rewards from their speculative investments. With the Second Supply, they expressed their frustrations and made demands upon the leaders of Jamestown in written form.\\r\\nIt fell to the third president of the Council to deliver a reply. By this time, Wingfield and Ratcliffe had been replaced by John Smith. Ever bold, Smith delivered what must have been a wake-up call to the investors in London. In what has been termed \\"Smith's Rude Answer\\", he composed a letter, writing (in part):\\r\\nSmith did begin his letter with something of an apology, saying \\"I humbly intreat your Pardons if I offend you with my rude Answer...\\",[21] although at the time, the word rude was acknowledged to mean unfinished or rural, in the same way modern English uses rustic.\\r\\nThere are strong indications that those in London comprehended and embraced Smith's message. Their Third Supply mission was by far the largest and best equipped. They even had a new purpose-built flagship constructed, Sea Venture, placed in the most experienced of hands, Christopher Newport. With a fleet of no fewer than eight ships, the Third Supply, led by Sea Venture, left Plymouth in June, 1609.\\r\\nOn the subject of the Virginia Company, it is notable that, throughout its existence, Sir Edwin Sandys, was a leading force. He, of course, also hoped for profits, but also his goals included a permanent colony which would enlarge English territory, relieve the nation's overpopulation, and expand the market for English goods. He is closely identified with a faction of the company led by Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. Although profits proved elusive for their investors, the visions for the Colony of Sir Edwin Sandys and the Earl of Southampton were eventually accomplished.\\r\\nIn the months before becoming president of the colony for a year in September 1608, Captain John Smith did considerable exploration up the Chesapeake Bay and along the various rivers. He is credited by legend with naming Stingray Point (near present-day Deltaville in Middlesex County for an incident there).\\r\\nSmith was always seeking a supply of food for the colonists, and he successfully traded for food with the Nansemonds, who were located along the Nansemond River in the modern-day City of Suffolk, and several other groups. However, while leading one food-gathering expedition in December 1607 (before his term as colony president), this time up the Chickahominy River west of Jamestown, his men were set upon by Powhatan Indians. As his party was being slaughtered around him, Smith strapped his Indian guide in front of him as a shield and escaped with his life but was captured by Opechancanough, the Powhatan chief's half-brother. Smith gave him a compass which pleased the warrior and made him decide to let Smith live.\\r\\nSmith was taken before Wahunsunacock, who was commonly referred to as Chief Powhatan, at the Powhatan Confederacy's seat of government at Werowocomoco on the York River. However, 17 years later, in 1624, Smith first related that when the chief decided to execute him, this course of action was stopped by the pleas of Chief Powhatan's young daughter, Pocahontas, who was originally named \\"Matoaka\\" but whose nickname meant \\"Playful Mischief\\". Many historians today find this account dubious, especially as it was omitted in all his previous versions. Smith returned to Jamestown just in time for the First Supply, in January 1608.\\r\\nIn September 1609, Smith was wounded in an accident. He was walking with his gun in the river, and the powder was in a pouch on his belt. His powder bag exploded. In October, he was sent back to England for medical treatment.\\r\\nWhile back in England, Smith wrote A True Relation and The Proceedings of the English Colony of Virginia about his experiences in Jamestown. These books, whose accuracy has been questioned by some historians due to some extent by Smith's boastful prose, were to generate public interest and new investment for the colony.\\r\\nAlthough the life of Chief Powhatan's young daughter, Pocahontas, would be largely tied to the English after legend credits her with saving John Smith's life after his capture by Opechancanough, her contacts with Smith himself were minimal. However, records indicate that she became something of an emissary to the colonists at Jamestown Island. During their first winter, following an almost complete destruction of their fort by a fire in January 1608, Pocahontas brought food and clothing to the colonists. She later negotiated with Smith for the release of Virginia Indians who had been captured by the colonists during a raid to gain English weaponry.\\r\\nDuring the next several years, the relationship between the Virginia Indians and the colonists became more strained, never more so than during the period of poor crops for both the natives and colonists which became known as the Starving Time in late 1609 and early 1610. Chief Powhatan relocated his principal capital from Werowocomoco, which was relatively close to Jamestown along the north shore of the York River, to a point more inland and secure along the upper reaches of the Chickahominy River.\\r\\nIn April 1613, Pocahontas and her husband, Kocoum were residing at Passapatanzy, a village of the Patawomecks, a Powhatan Confederacy tribe which did some trading with Powhatans. They lived in present-day Stafford County on the Potomac River near Fredericksburg, about 65 miles (105?km) from Werowocomoco. She was abducted by Englishmen whose leader was Samuel Argall, and transported about 90 miles (140?km) south to the English settlement at Henricus on the James River. There, Pocahontas converted to Christianity and took the name \\"Rebecca\\" under the tutelage of Reverend Alexander Whitaker who had arrived in Jamestown in 1611. She married prominent planter John Rolfe, who had lost his first wife and child in the journey from England several years earlier, which served to greatly improve relations between the Virginia Native Americans and the colonists for several years. However, when she and John Rolfe took their young son Thomas Rolfe on a public relations trip to England to help raise more investment money for the Virginia Company, she became ill and died just as they were leaving to return to Virginia. Her interment was at St George's Church in Gravesend.\\r\\nWhat became known as the \\"Starving Time\\" in the Virginia Colony occurred during the winter of 1609ÿ10. Only 60 of 500 English colonists survived.[22][23][24]\\r\\nThe colonists, the first group of whom had originally arrived at Jamestown on May 14, 1607, had never planned to grow all of their own food. Instead, their plans also depended upon trade with the local Virginia Indians to supply them with enough food between the arrival of periodic supply ships from England, upon which they also relied.\\r\\nThis period of extreme hardship for the colonists began in 1609 with a drought which caused their already limited farming activities to produce even fewer crops than usual. Then, there were problems with both of their other sources for food.\\r\\nAn unexpected delay occurred during the Virginia Company of London's Third Supply mission from England due to a major hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. A large portion of the food and supplies had been aboard the new flagship of the Virginia Company, Sea Venture, which became shipwrecked at Bermuda and separated from the other ships, seven of which arrived at the colony with even more new colonists to feed, and few supplies, most of which had been aboard the larger flagship.\\r\\nThe impending hardship was further compounded by the loss of their most skillful leader in dealing with the Powhatan Confederacy in trading for food: Captain John Smith. He became injured in August 1609 in a gunpowder accident, and was forced to return to England for medical attention in October 1609. After Smith left, Chief Powhatan severely curtailed trading with the colonists for food. Neither the missing Sea Venture nor any other supply ship arrived as winter set upon the inhabitants of the young colony in late 1609.\\r\\nWhen the survivors of the shipwreck of the Third Supply mission's flagship Sea Venture finally arrived at Jamestown the following May 23 in two makeshift ships they had constructed while stranded on Bermuda for nine months, they found fewer than 100 colonists still alive, many of whom were sick. Worse yet, the Bermuda survivors had brought few supplies and only a small amount of food with them, expecting to find a thriving colony at Jamestown.\\r\\nThus, even with the arrival of the two small ships from Bermuda under Captain Christopher Newport, they were faced with abandoning Jamestown and returning to England. On June 7, 1610, both groups of survivors (from Jamestown and Bermuda) boarded ships, and they all set sail down the James River toward the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.\\r\\nShortly after they had abandoned Jamestown, they came upon a fleet of three supply ships arriving from England, commanded by a new governor, The 3rd Baron De La Warr. The two groups met on the James River on June 9, 1610 near Mulberry Island (adjacent to present-day Fort Eustis in Newport News).\\r\\nWith the new supply mission, Lord De La Warr, the new Governor, often known in modern times as \\"Lord Delaware\\", brought additional colonists, a doctor, food, and much-needed supplies. He also was of a strong determination that Jamestown and the colony were not to be abandoned. He turned the departing ships around and brought the entire group back to Jamestown. This was certainly not a popular decision at the time with at least some of the group, but Lord Delaware was to prove a new kind of leader for Virginia.\\r\\nIncluded in those returning to Jamestown was a colonist whose wife and child had died during the shipwreck of the Sea Venture and the time at Bermuda. A businessman, he had with him some seeds for a new strain of tobacco and also some untried marketing ideas. That colonist was John Rolfe. Despite his misfortune to that point, history records that he would change the future of the colony as much as Lord Delaware's timely arrival had.\\r\\nSea Venture was the new flagship of the Virginia Company. Leaving England in 1609, and leading this Third Supply to Jamestown as \\"Vice Admiral\\" and commanding Sea Venture, Christopher Newport was in charge of a nine-vessel fleet. Aboard the flagship Sea Venture was the Admiral of the Company, Sir George Somers, Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Gates, William Strachey and other notable personages in the early history of English colonization in North America.\\r\\nWhile at sea, the fleet encountered a strong storm, perhaps a hurricane, which lasted for three days. Sea Venture and one other ship were separated from the seven other vessels of the fleet. Sea Venture was deliberately driven onto the reefs of Bermuda to prevent her sinking. The 150 passengers and crew members were all landed safely but the ship was now permanently damaged.[25]\\r\\nSea Venture's longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Virginia but it and its crew were never seen again. The remaining survivors spent nine months on Bermuda building two smaller ships, Deliverance and Patience from Bermuda cedar and materials salvaged from Sea Venture.\\r\\nLeaving two men at Bermuda to maintain England's claim to the archipelago, the remainder sailed to Jamestown, finally arriving on May 23, 1610. They found the Virginia Colony in ruins and practically abandoned. Of 500 settlers who had preceded them to Jamestown, they found fewer than 100 survivors, many of whom were sick or dying. It was decided to abandon the colony and on June 7, everyone was placed aboard the ships to return to England.\\r\\nDuring the same period that Sea Venture suffered its misfortune and its survivors were struggling in Bermuda to continue on to Virginia, back in England, the publication of Captain John Smith's books of his adventures in Virginia sparked a resurgence in interest in the colony. This helped lead to the dispatch in early 1610 of additional colonists, more supplies, and a new governor, Thomas West, Baron De La Warr.\\r\\nOn June 9, 1610, Lord De La Warr and his party arrived on the James River shortly after Deliverance and Patience had abandoned Jamestown. Intercepting them about 10 miles (16?km) downstream from Jamestown near Mulberry Island, the new governor forced the remaining 90 settlers to return, thwarting their plans to abandon the colony. Deliverance and Patience turned back, and all the settlers were landed again at Jamestown.[26]\\r\\nThen, Sir George Somers returned to Bermuda with Patience to obtain more food supplies, but he died on the island that summer. His nephew, Matthew Somers, Captain of Patience, took the ship back to Lyme Regis, England instead of Virginia (leaving a third man behind). The Third Charter of the Virginia Company was then extended far enough across the Atlantic to include Bermuda in 1612. (Although a separate company, the Somers Isles Company, would be spun off to administer Bermuda from 1615, the first two successful English colonies would retain close ties for many more generations, as was demonstrated when Virginian general George Washington called upon the people of Bermuda for aid during the American War of Independence). In 1613, Sir Thomas Dale founded the settlement of Bermuda Hundred on the James River, which, a year later, became the first incorporated town in Virginia.\\r\\nBy 1611, a majority of the colonists who had arrived at the Jamestown settlement had died and its economic value was negligible with no active exports to England and very little internal economic activity. Only financial incentives including a promise of more land to the west from King James I to investors financing the new colony kept the project afloat.\\r\\nThe Anglo-Powhatan Wars were three wars fought between English settlers of the Virginia Colony, and Indians of the Powhatan Confederacy in the early seventeenth century. The First War started in 1610, and ended in a peace settlement in 1614.\\r\\nIn 1610, John Rolfe, whose wife and a child had died in Bermuda during passage in the Third Supply to Virginia, was just one of the settlers who had arrived in Jamestown following the shipwreck of Sea Venture. However, his major contribution is that he was the first man to successfully raise export tobacco in the Colony (although the colonists had begun to make glass artifacts to export immediately after their arrival). The native tobacco raised in Virginia prior to that time, Nicotiana rustica, was not to the liking of the Europeans but Rolfe had brought some seed for Nicotiana tabacum with him from Bermuda.\\r\\nAlthough most people \\"wouldn't touch\\" the crop, Rolfe was able to make his fortune farming it, successfully exporting beginning in 1612. Soon almost all other colonists followed suit, as windfall profits in tobacco briefly lent Jamestown something like a gold rush atmosphere. Among others, Rolfe quickly became both a wealthy and prominent man. He married the young Virginia Indian woman Pocahontas on April 24, 1614. They lived first across the river from Jamestown, and later at his Varina Farms plantation near Henricus. Their son, Thomas Rolfe, was born in 1615.\\r\\nIn 1611, the Virginia Company of London sent Sir Thomas Dale to act as deputy-governor or as high marshall for the Virginia Colony under the authority of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (Lord Delaware). He arrived at Jamestown on May 19 with three ships, additional men, cattle, and provisions. Finding the conditions unhealthy and greatly in need of improvement, he immediately called for a meeting of the Jamestown Council, and established crews to rebuild Jamestown.\\r\\nHe served as Governor for 3 months in 1611, and again for a two-year period between 1614 and 1616. It was during his administration that the first code of laws of Virginia, nominally in force from 1611 to 1619, was effectively tested. This code, entitled \\"Articles, Lawes, and Orders Divine, Politique, and Martiall\\" (popularly known as Dale's Code), was notable for its pitiless severity, and seems to have been prepared in large part by Dale himself.\\r\\nSeeking a better site than Jamestown with the thought of possibly relocating the capital, Thomas Dale sailed up the James River (also named after King James) to the area now known as Chesterfield County. He was apparently impressed with the possibilities of the general area where the Appomattox River joins the James River, until then occupied by the Appomattoc Indians, and there are published references to the name \\"New Bermudas\\" although it apparently was never formalized. (Far from the mainland of North America, the archipelago of Bermuda had been established as part of the Virginia Colony in 1612 following the shipwreck of Sea Venture in 1609).\\r\\nA short distance further up the James, in 1611, he began the construction of a progressive development at Henricus on and about what was later known as Farrars Island. Henricus was envisioned as possible replacement capital for Jamestown, though it was eventually destroyed during the Indian Massacre of 1622, during which a third of the colonists were killed.\\r\\nIn 1616, Governor Dale joined John Rolfe and Pocahontas and their young son Thomas as they left their Varina Farms plantation for a public relations mission to England, where Pocahontas was received and treated as a form of visiting royalty by Queen Anne. This stimulated more interest in investments in the Virginia Company, the desired effect. However, as the couple prepared to return to Virginia, Pocahontas died of an illness at Gravesend on March 17, 1617, where she was buried. John Rolfe returned to Virginia alone once again, leaving their son Thomas Rolfe, then a small child, in England to obtain an education.\\r\\nOnce back in Virginia, Rolfe married Jane Pierce and continued to improve the quality of his tobacco with the result that by the time of his death in 1622, the Colony was thriving as a producer of tobacco.\\r\\nOrphaned by the age of 8, young Thomas later returned to Virginia, and settled across the James River not far from his parents farm at Varina, where he married Jane Poythress and they had one daughter, Jane Rolfe, who was born in 1650. Many of the First Families of Virginia trace their lineage through Thomas Rolfe to both Pocahontas and John Rolfe, joining English and Virginia Indian heritage.\\r\\nVirginia's population grew rapidly from 1618 until 1622, rising from a few hundred to nearly 1,400 people. Wheat was also grown in Virginia starting in 1618.\\r\\nOn June 30, 1619 Slovak and Polish artisans conducted the first labor strike (first \\"in American history\\"[27][28]) for democratic rights (\\"No Vote, No Work\\")[27][29] in Jamestown.[29][30][31] The British Crown overturned the legislation in the Virginia House of Burgesses in its first meeting[32] and granted the workers equal voting rights on July 21, 1619.[33] Afterwards, the labor strike was ended and the artisans resumed their work.[30][31][34][35] The House of Burgesses, the first legislature of elected representatives in America, met in the Jamestown Church. One of their first laws was to set a minimum price for the sale of tobacco and set forth plans for the creation of the first ironworks of the colony. This legislative group was the predecessor of the modern Virginia General Assembly.\\r\\nIn August 1619 \\"20 and odd Blacks\\" arrived on the Dutch Man-of-War ship at Jamestown colony. This is the earliest record of Black people in colonial America [36] These colonists were freemen and indentured servants.[37][38][39] At this time the slave trade between Africa and the English colonies had not yet been established.\\r\\nRecords from 1623 and 1624 listed the African inhabitants of the colony as servants, not slaves. In the case of William Tucker, the first Black person born in the colonies, freedom was his bright right.[40] He was son of \\"Antony and Isabell\\", a married couple from Angola who worked as indentured servants for Captain William Tucker whom he was named after. Yet, court records show that at least one African had been declared a slave by 1640; John Punch. He was an indentured servant who ran away along with two White indentured servants and he was sentenced by the governing council to lifelong servitude. This action is what officially marked the institution of slavery in Jamestown and the future United States.\\r\\nBy 1620, more German settlers from Hamburg, Germany, who were recruited by the Virginia Company set up and operated one of the first sawmills in the region.[41] Among the Germans were several other skilled craftsmen carpenters, and pitch/tar/soap-ash makers, who produced some of the colony's first exports of these products. The Italians included a team of glass makers.[42]\\r\\nDuring 1621 fifty-seven unmarried women sailed to Virginia under the auspices of the Virginia Company, who paid for their transport and provided them with a small bundle of clothing and other goods to take with them. A colonist who married one of the women would be responsible for repaying the Virginia Company for his wife's transport and provisions. The women traveled on three ships, The Marmaduke, The Warwick, and The Tyger.\\r\\nMany of the women were not \\"maids\\" but widows. Some others were children, for example Priscilla, the eight-year-old daughter of Joanne Palmer, who travelled with her mother and her new stepfather, Thomas Palmer, on The Tyger. Some were women who were traveling with family or relatives: Ursula Clawson, \\"kinswoman\\" of ancient planter Richard Pace, traveled with Pace and his wife on the Marmaduke. Ann Jackson also came on the Marmaduke, in the company of her brother John Jackson, both of them bound for Martin's Hundred. Ann Jackson was one of the women taken captive by the Powhatans during the Indian Massacre of 1622. She was not returned until 1630. The Council ordered that she should be sent back to England on the first available ship, perhaps because she was suffering from the consequences of her long captivity.[43]\\r\\nSome of the women sent to Virginia did marry. But most disappeared from the recordsperhaps killed in the massacre, perhaps' dead from other causes, perhaps returned to England. In other words, they shared the fate of most of their fellow colonists.[44]\\r\\nThe relations with the Natives took a turn for the worse after the death of Pocahontas in England and the return of John Rolfe and other colonial leaders in May 1617. Disease, poor harvests and the growing demand for tobacco lands caused hostilities to escalate.\\r\\nAfter Wahunsunacock's death in 1618, his younger brother, Opitchapam, briefly became chief. However, he was soon succeeded by his own younger brother, Opechancanough. Opechancanough was not interested in attempting peaceful coexistence with the English settlers. Instead, he was determined to eradicate the colonists from what he considered to be Indian lands.\\r\\nChief Opechancanough organized and led a well-coordinated series of surprise attacks on multiple English settlements along both sides of a 50-mile (80?km) long stretch of the James River which took place early on the morning of March 22, 1622. This event came to be known as the Indian Massacre of 1622, and resulted in the deaths of 347 colonists (including men, women, and children) and the abduction of many others. Some say that this massacre was revenge. The Massacre caught most of the Virginia Colony by surprise and virtually wiped out several entire communities, including Henricus and Wolstenholme Town at Martin's Hundred.\\r\\nHowever, Jamestown was spared from destruction due to a Virginia Indian boy named Chanco who, after learning of the planned attacks from his brother, gave warning to colonist Richard Pace, with whom he lived. Pace, after securing himself and his neighbors on the south side of the James River, took a canoe across river to warn Jamestown, which narrowly escaped destruction, although there was no time to warn the other settlements. Apparently, Opechancanough subsequently was unaware of Chanco's actions, as the young man continued to serve as his courier for some time after.\\r\\nA letter by Richard Frethorne, written in 1623, reports, \\"we live in fear of the enemy every hour.\\"[45]\\r\\nAs a result, another war between the two powers lasted from 1622 to 1632.\\r\\nSome historians have noted that, as the settlers of the Virginia Colony were allowed some representative government, and they prospered, King James I was reluctant to lose either power or future financial potential. In any case, in 1624, the Virginia Company lost its charter and Virginia became a crown colony.\\r\\nIn 1634, the English Crown created eight shires (i.e. counties) in the colony of Virginia which had a total population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. James City Shire was established and included Jamestown. Around 1642-43, the name of the James City Shire was changed to James City County.\\r\\nThe original Jamestown fort seems to have existed into the middle of the 1620s, but as Jamestown grew into a \\"New Town\\" to the east, written references to the original fort disappear. By 1634, a palisade (stockade) was completed across the Virginia Peninsula, which was about 6 miles (9.7?km) wide at that point between Queen's Creek which fed into the York River and Archer's Hope Creek, (since renamed College Creek) which fed into the James River. The new palisade provided some security from attacks by the Virginia Indians for colonists farming and fishing lower on the Peninsula from that point.\\r\\nOn April 18, 1644, Opechancanough again tried to force the colonists to abandon the region with another series of coordinated attacks, killing almost 500 colonists. However, this was a much less devastating portion of the growing population than had been the case in the 1622 attacks. Furthermore, the forces of Royal Governor of Virginia William Berkeley captured the old warrior in 1646,[46] variously thought to be between 90 and 100 years old. In October, while a prisoner, Opechancanough was killed by a soldier (shot in the back) assigned to guard him. Opechancanough was succeeded as Weroance (Chief) by Nectowance and then by Totopotomoi and later by his daughter Cockacoeske.\\r\\nIn 1646, the first treaties were signed between the Virginia Indians and the English. The treaties set up reservations, some of the oldest in America, for the surviving Powhatan. It also set up tribute payments for the Virginia Indians to be made yearly to the English.[47]\\r\\nThat war resulted in a boundary being defined between the Indians and English lands that could only be crossed for official business with a special pass. This situation would last until 1677 and the Treaty of Middle Plantation, which established Indian reservations following Bacon's Rebellion.\\r\\nOn October 20, 1698, the statehouse (capitol building) in Jamestown burned for the fourth time. Once again removing itself to a familiar alternate location, the legislature met at Middle Plantation, this time in the new College Building at the College of William and Mary, which had begun meeting there in temporary quarters in 1694.\\r\\nWhile meeting there, a group of five students from the College submitted a well-presented and logical proposal to the legislators outlining a plan and good reasons to move the capital permanently to Middle Plantation.\\r\\nDespite the periodic need to relocate the legislature from Jamestown due to contingencies such as fires, (usually to Middle Plantation), throughout the seventeenth century, Virginians had been reluctant to permanently move the capital from its \\"ancient and accustomed place.\\" After all, Jamestown had always been Virginia's capital. It had a state house (except when it periodically burned) and a church, and it offered easy access to ships that came up the James River bringing goods from England and taking on tobacco bound for market.[48] However, Jamestown's status had been in some decline. In 1662, Jamestown's status as mandatory port of entry for Virginia had been ended.\\r\\nThe students argued that the change to the high ground at Middle Plantation would escape the dreaded malaria and mosquitoes that had always plagued the swampy, low-lying Jamestown site. The students pointed out that, while not located immediately upon a river, Middle Plantation offered nearby access to not one, but two rivers, via two deep water (6-7' depth) creeks, Queen's Creek leading to the York River, and College Creek (formerly known as Archer's Hope) which led to the James River. Other advocates of the move included the Reverend Dr. James Blair and the Governor, Sir Francis Nicholson.\\r\\nSeveral prominent individuals like John Page, Thomas Ludwell, Philip Ludwell, and Otho Thorpe had built fine brick homes and created a substantial town at Middle Plantation. And, there was of course, the new College of William and Mary with its fine new brick building.\\r\\nThe proposal to move the capital of Virginia to higher ground (about 12 miles (20?km) away) at Middle Plantation was received favorably by the House of Burgesses. In 1699, the capital of the Virginia Colony was officially relocated there. Soon, the town was renamed Williamsburg, in honor of King William III. Thus, the first phase of Jamestown's history ended.\\r\\nBy the 1750s the land was owned and heavily cultivated, primarily by the Travis and Ambler families. A military post was located on the island during the Revolutionary War and American and British prisoners were exchanged there. During the U.S. Civil War the island was occupied by Confederate soldiers who built an earth fort near the church as part of the defense system to block the Union advance up the river to Richmond. Little further attention was paid to Virginia until preservation was undertaken in the twenty first century.","input":"What crop was known as virginia's gold and silver?"},{"output":"Spain","context":"USS Maine (ACR-1) is an American naval ship that sank in Havana Harbor during the Cuban revolt against Spain, an event that became a major political issue in the United States.\\r\\nCommissioned in 1895, this was the first United States Navy ship to be named after the state of Maine.[a][1] Originally classified as an armored cruiser, she was built in response to the Brazilian battleship?Riachuelo and the increase of naval forces in Latin America. Maine and her near-sister ship Texas reflected the latest European naval developments, with the layout of her main armament resembling that of the British ironclad Inflexible and comparable Italian ships. Her two gun turrets were staggered en chelon, rather than on the centerline, with the fore gun sponsoned out on the starboard side of the ship and the aft gun on the port side,[2] with cutaways in the superstructure to allow both to fire ahead, astern or across her deck. She dispensed with full masts thanks to the increased reliability of steam engines by the time of her construction.\\r\\nDespite these advances, Maine was out of date by the time she entered service, due to her protracted construction period and changes in the role of ships of her type, naval tactics and technology. It took nine years to complete, and nearly three years for the armor plating alone.[2] The general use of steel in warship construction precluded the use of ramming without danger to the attacking vessel. The potential for blast damage from firing end on or cross-deck discouraged en chelon gun placement. The changing role of the armored cruiser from a small, heavily armored substitute for the battleship to a fast, lightly armored commerce raider also hastened her obsolescence. Despite these disadvantages, Maine was seen as an advance in American warship design.\\r\\nMaine is best known for her loss in Havana Harbor on the evening of 15 February 1898. Sent to protect U.S. interests during the Cuban revolt against Spain, she exploded suddenly, without warning, and sank quickly, killing nearly three quarters of her crew. The cause and responsibility for her sinking remained unclear after a board of inquiry investigated. Nevertheless, popular opinion in the U.S., fanned by inflammatory articles printed in the \\"yellow press\\" by William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, blamed Spain. The phrase, \\"Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!\\", became a rallying cry for action, which came with the SpanishÿAmerican War later that year. While the sinking of Maine was not a direct cause for action, it served as a catalyst, accelerating the approach to a diplomatic impasse between the U.S. and Spain.\\r\\nThe cause of Maine's sinking remains a subject of speculation. In 1898, an investigation of the explosion was carried out by a naval board appointed under the McKinley Administration. The consensus of the board was that Maine was destroyed by an external explosion from a mine. However, the validity of this investigation has been challenged. George W. Melville, a chief engineer in the Navy, proposed that a more likely cause for the sinking was from a magazine explosion within the vessel. The Navy's leading ordnance expert, Philip R. Alger, took this theory further by suggesting that the magazines were ignited by a spontaneous fire in a coal bunker.[3] The coal used in Maine was bituminous coal, which is known for releasing firedamp, a gas that is prone to spontaneous explosions. There is stronger evidence that the explosion of Maine was caused by an internal coal fire which ignited the magazines. This was a likely cause of the explosion, rather than the initial hypothesis of a mine. The ship lay at the bottom of the harbor until 1911. A cofferdam was then built around the wreck.[4] The hull was patched up until the ship was afloat, then towed to sea and sunk. The Maine now lies on the sea-bed 3,600 feet (1,100?m) below the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe delivery of the Brazilian battleship?Riachuelo in 1883 and the acquisition of other modern armored warships from Europe by Brazil, Argentina and Chile shortly afterwards, alarmed the United States government, as the Brazilian Navy was now the most powerful in the Americas.[5] The chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, Hilary A. Herbert, stated to Congress: \\"if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid-ocean and confronted by Riachuelo it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the American flag would get into port.\\"[6] These developments helped bring to a head a series of discussions that had been taking place at the Naval Advisory Board since 1881. The board knew at that time that the U.S. Navy could not challenge any major European fleet; at best, it could wear down an opponent's merchant fleet and hope to make some progress through general attrition there. Moreover, projecting naval force abroad through the use of battleships ran counter to the government policy of isolationism. While some on the board supported a strict policy of commerce raiding, others argued it would be ineffective against the potential threat of enemy battleships stationed near the American coast. The two sides remained essentially deadlocked until Riachuelo manifested.[7]\\r\\nThe board, now confronted with the concrete possibility of hostile warships operating off the American coast, began planning for ships to protect it in 1884. The ships had to fit within existing docks and had to have a shallow draft to enable them to use all the major American ports and bases. The maximum beam was similarly fixed, and the board concluded that at a length of about 300 feet (91?m), the maximum displacement would be about 7,000 tons. A year later the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C & R) presented two designs to Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney, one for a 7,500-ton battleship and one for a 5,000-ton armored cruiser. Whitney decided instead to ask Congress for two 6,000-ton warships, and they were authorized in August 1886. A design contest was held, asking naval architects to submit designs for the two ships: armored cruiser Maine and battleship Texas. It was specified that Maine had to have a speed of 17 knots (31?km/h; 20?mph), a ram bow, and a double bottom, and be able to carry two torpedo boats. Her armament was specified as: four 10-inch (254?mm) guns, six 6-inch (152?mm) guns, various light weapons, and four torpedo tubes. It was specifically stated that the main guns \\"must afford heavy bow and stern fire.\\"[8] Armor thickness and many details were also defined. Specifications for Texas were similar, but demanded a main battery of two 12-inch (305?mm) guns and slightly thicker armor.[9]\\r\\nThe winning design for Maine was from Theodore D. Wilson, who served as chief constructor for C & R and was a member on the Naval Advisory Board in 1881. He had designed a number of other warships for the navy.[10] The winning design for Texas was from a British designer, William John, who was working for the Barrow Shipbuilding Company at that time. Both designs resembled the Brazilian battleship Riachuelo, having the main gun turrets sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned.[11] The winning design for Maine, though conservative and inferior to other contenders, may have received special consideration due to a requirement that one of the two new ships be Americanÿdesigned.[12]\\r\\nCongress authorized construction of Maine on 3 August 1886, and her keel was laid down on 17 October 1888, at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. She was the largest vessel built in a U.S. Navy yard up to that time.[13]\\r\\nMaine's building time of nine years was unusually protracted, due to the limits of U.S. industry at the time. (The delivery of her armored plating took three years and a fire in the drafting room of the building yard, where Maine's working set of blueprints were stored, caused further delay.) In those nine years, naval tactics and technology changed radically and left Maine's actual role in the navy ill-defined. At the time she was laid down, armored cruisers such as Maine were intended to serve as small battleships on overseas service and were built with heavy belt armor. Great Britain, France and Russia had constructed such ships to serve this purpose and sold others of this type, including Riachuelo, to second-rate navies. Within a decade, this role had changed to commerce raiding, for which fast, long-range vessels, with only limited armor protection, were needed. The advent of lightweight armor, such as Harvey steel, made this transformation possible.[14]\\r\\nAs a result of these changing priorities, Maine was caught between two separate positions and could not perform either one adequately. She lacked both the armor and firepower to serve as a ship-of-the-line against enemy battleships and the speed to serve as a cruiser. Nevertheless, she was expected to fulfill more than one tactical function.[15] In addition, because of the potential of a warship sustaining blast damage to herself from cross-deck and end-on fire, Maine's main-gun arrangement was obsolete by the time she entered service.[11]\\r\\nMaine was 324?feet 4?inches (98.9?m) long overall, with a beam of 57 feet (17.4?m), a maximum draft of 22?feet 6?inches (6.9?m) and a displacement of 6,682 long tons (6,789.2?t).[16] She was divided into 214 watertight compartments.[17] A centerline longitudinal watertight bulkhead separated the engines and a double bottom covered the hull only from the foremast to the aft end of the armored citadel, a distance of 196 feet (59.7?m). She had a metacentric height of 3.45 feet (1.1?m) as designed and was fitted with a ram bow.[18]\\r\\nMaine's hull was long and narrow, more like a cruiser than that of Texas, which was wide-beamed. Normally, this would have made Maine the faster ship of the two. However, Maine's weight distribution was ill-balanced, which slowed her considerably. Her main turrets, awkwardly situated on a cut-away gundeck, were nearly awash in bad weather. Because they were mounted toward the ends of the ship, away from its center of gravity, Maine was also prone to greater motion in heavy seas. While she and Texas were both considered seaworthy, the latter's high hull and guns mounted on her main deck made her the drier ship.[19]\\r\\nThe two main gun turrets were sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow both to fire fore and aft. The practice of en echelon mounting had begun with Italian battleships designed in the 1870s by Benedetto Brin and followed by the British Navy with HMS?Inflexible, which was laid down in 1874 but not commissioned until October 1881.[20] This gun arrangement met the design demand for heavy end-on fire in a ship-to-ship encounter, tactics which involved ramming the enemy vessel.[11] The wisdom of this tactic was purely theoretical at the time it was implemented. A drawback of an en echelon layout limited the ability for a ship to fire broadside, a key factor when employed in a line of battle. To allow for at least partial broadside fire, Maine's superstructure was separated into three structures. This technically allowed both turrets to fire across the ship's deck (cross-deck fire), between the sections. However, this ability was still significantly limited as the superstructure restricted each turret's arc of fire.[8]\\r\\nThis plan and profile view show Maine with eight six-pounder guns (one is not seen on the port part of the bridge but that is due to the bridge being cut away in the drawing). Another early published plan shows the same. In both cases the photographs show a single extreme bow mounted six-pounder. However, careful examination of Maine photographs confirm that she did not carry that gun. Maine's armament set up in the bow was not identical to the stern which had a single six-pounder mounted at extreme aft of the vessel. Maine carried two six-pounders forward, two on the bridge and three on the stern section, all one level above the abbreviated gun deck that permitted the ten-inch guns to fire across the deck. The six-pounders located in the bow were positioned more forward than the pair mounted aft which necessitated the far aft single six-pounder.\\r\\nMaine was the first U.S. capital ship to have its power plant given as high a priority as its fighting strength.[21] Her machinery, built by the N. F. Palmer Jr. & Company's Quintard Iron Works of New York,[22] was the first designed for a major ship under the direct supervision of Arctic explorer and soon-to-be commodore, George Wallace Melville.[23] She had two inverted vertical triple-expansion steam engines, mounted in watertight compartments and separated by a fore-to-aft bulkhead, with a total designed output of 9,293 indicated horsepower (6,930?kW). Cylinder diameters were 35.5 inches (900?mm) (high-pressure), 57 inches (1,400?mm) (intermediate-pressure) and 88 inches (2,200?mm) (low-pressure). Stroke for all three pistons was 36 inches (910?mm).[17]\\r\\nMelville mounted Maine's engines with the cylinders in vertical mode, a departure from conventional practice. Previous ships had had their engines mounted in horizontal mode, so that they would be completely protected below the waterline. Melville believed a ship's engines needed ample room to operate and that any exposed parts could be protected by an armored deck. He therefore opted for the greater efficiency, lower maintenance costs and higher speeds offered by the vertical mode.[24][25] Also, the engines were constructed with the high-pressure cylinder aft and the low-pressure cylinder forward. This was done, according to the ship's chief engineer, A. W. Morley, so the low-pressure cylinder could be disconnected when the ship was under low power. This allowed the high and intermediate-power cylinders to be run together as a compound engine for economical running.[clarification needed]\\r\\nEight single-ended Scotch marine boilers provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of 135 pounds per square inch (930?kPa; 9.5?kgf/cm2) at a temperature 364?F (184?C). On trials, she reached a speed of 16.45 knots (30.47?km/h; 18.93?mph), failing to meet her contract speed of 17 knots (31?km/h; 20?mph). She carried a maximum load of 896 long tons (910?t) of coal[26] in 20 bunkers, 10 on each side, which extended below the protective deck. Wing bunkers at each end of each fire room extended inboard to the front of the boilers.[17] This was actually a very low capacity for a ship of Maine's rating, which limited her time at sea and her ability to run at flank speed, when coal consumption increased dramatically. Maine's overhanging main turrets also prevented coaling at sea, except in the calmest of waters; otherwise, the potential for damage to a collier, herself or both vessels was extremely great.\\r\\nMaine also carried two small dynamos to power her searchlights and provide interior lighting.[27]\\r\\nMaine was designed initially with a three-mast barque rig for auxiliary propulsion, in case of engine failure and to aid long-range cruising.[28] This arrangement was limited to \\"two-thirds\\" of full sail power, determined by the ship's tonnage and immersed cross-section.[29] The mizzen mast was removed in 1892, after the ship had been launched, but before her completion.[28] Maine was completed with a two-mast military rig and the ship never spread any canvas.[30]\\r\\nMaine's main armament consisted of four 10-inch (254?mm)/30 caliber Mark II guns, which had a maximum elevation of 15 and could depress to ?3. Ninety rounds per gun were carried. The ten-inch guns fired a 510 pounds (231?kg) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per second (610?m/s) to a range of 20,000 yards (18,000?m) at maximum elevation.[31] These guns were mounted in twin hydraulically powered Mark 3 turrets, the fore turret sponsoned to starboard and the aft turret sponsoned to port.[5]\\r\\nThe 10\\" guns were initially to be mounted in open barbettes (the C & R proposal blueprint shows them as such). During Maine's extended construction, the development of rapid-fire intermediate-caliber guns, which could fire high-explosive shells, became a serious threat and the navy redesigned Maine with enclosed turrets. Because of the corresponding weight increase, the turrets were mounted one deck lower than planned originally.[30][32] Even with this modification, the main guns were high enough to fire unobstructed for 180 on one side and 64 on the other side.[17] They could also be loaded at any angle of train; initially the main guns of Texas, by comparison, with external rammers, could be loaded only when trained on the centerline or directly abeam, a common feature in battleships built before 1890.[11] However, by 1897, Texas' turrets had been modified with internal rammers to permit much faster reloading.\\r\\nThe en echelon arrangement proved problematic. Because Maine's turrets were not counterbalanced, she heeled over if both were pointed in the same direction, which reduced the range of the guns. Also, cross-deck firing damaged her deck and superstructure significantly due to the vacuum from passing shells.[33] Because of this, and the potential for undue hull stress if the main guns were fired end-on, the en echelon arrangement was not used in U.S. Navy designs after Maine and Texas.[11][33]\\r\\nThe six 6-inch (152?mm)/30 caliber Mark 3 guns were mounted in casemates in the hull, two each at the bow and stern and the last two amidships.[22] Data is lacking, but they could probably depress to ?7 and elevate to +12. They fired shells that weighed 105 pounds (48?kg) with a muzzle velocity of about 1,950 feet per second (590?m/s). They had a maximum range of 9,000 yards (8,200?m) at full elevation.[34]\\r\\nThe anti-torpedo boat armament consisted of seven 57-millimeter (2.2?in) Driggs-Schroeder six-pounder guns mounted on the superstructure deck.[22] They fired a shell weighing about 6?lb (2.7?kg) at a muzzle velocity of about 1,765 feet per second (538?m/s) at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a maximum range of 8,700 yards (7,955?m).[35] The lighter armament comprised four each 37-millimeter (1.5?in) Hotchkiss and Driggs-Schroeder one-pounder guns. Four of these were mounted on the superstructure deck, two were mounted in small casemates at the extreme stern and one was mounted in each fighting top.[22] They fired a shell weighing about 1.1 pounds (0.50?kg) at a muzzle velocity of about 2,000 feet per second (610?m/s) at a rate of 30 rounds per minute to a range about 3,500 yards (3,200?m).[36]\\r\\nMaine had four 18-inch (457?mm) above-water torpedo tubes, two on each broadside. In addition, she was designed to carry two 14.8 long tons (15.0?t) steam-powered torpedo boats, each with a single 14-inch (356?mm) torpedo tube and a one-pounder gun. Only one was built, but it had a top speed of only a little over 12 knots (22?km/h; 14?mph) so it was transferred to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island, as a training craft.[b][37]\\r\\nThe main waterline belt, made of nickel steel, had a maximum thickness of 12 inches (305?mm) and tapered to 7 inches (178?mm) at its lower edge. It was 180 feet (54.9?m) long and covered the machinery spaces and the 10-inch magazines. It was 7 feet (2.1?m) high, of which 3 feet (0.9?m) was above the design waterline. It angled inwards for 17 feet (5.2?m) at each end, thinning to 8 inches (203?mm), to provide protection against raking fire. A 6-inch transverse bulkhead closed off the forward end of the armored citadel. The forward portion of the 2-inch-thick (51?mm) protective deck ran from the bulkhead all the way to the bow and served to stiffen the ram. The deck sloped downwards to the sides, but its thickness increased to 3 inches (76?mm). The rear portion of the protective deck sloped downwards towards the stern, going below the waterline, to protect the propeller shafts and steering gear. The sides of the circular turrets were 8 inches thick. The barbettes were 12 inches thick, with their lower portions reduced to 10 inches. The conning tower had 10-inch walls. The ship's voicepipes and electrical leads were protected by an armored tube 4.5 inches (114?mm) thick.[38]\\r\\nTwo flaws emerged in Maine's protection, both due to technological developments between her laying-down and her completion. The first was a lack of adequate topside armor to counter the effects of rapid-fire intermediate-caliber guns and high-explosive shells. This was a flaw she shared with Texas.[33] The second was the use of nickel-steel armor. Introduced in 1889, nickel steel was the first modern steel alloy armor and, with a figure of merit of 0.67, was an improvement over the 0.6 rating of mild steel used until then. Harvey steel and Krupp armors, both of which appeared in 1893, had merit figures of between 0.9 and 1.2, giving them roughly twice the tensile strength of nickel steel. Although all three armors shared the same density (about 40 pounds per square foot for a one-inch-thick plate), six inches of Krupp or Harvey steel gave the same protection as 10?inches of nickel. The weight thus saved could be applied either to additional hull structure and machinery or to achieving higher speed. The navy would incorporate Harvey armor in the Indiana-class battleships, designed after Maine, but commissioned at roughly the same time.[39][40]\\r\\nMaine was launched on 18 November 1889, sponsored by Alice Tracey Wilmerding, the granddaughter of Navy Secretary Benjamin F. Tracy. Not long afterwards, a reporter wrote for Marine Engineer and Naval Architect magazine, \\"it cannot be denied that the navy of the United States is making rapid strides towards taking a credible position among the navies of the world, and the launch of the new armoured battleship Maine from the Brooklyn Navy Yard ... has added a most powerful unit to the United States fleet of turret ships.\\"[41] In his 1890 annual report to congress, the Secretary of the Navy wrote, \\"the Maine ... stands in a class by herself\\" and expected the ship to be commissioned by July 1892.[13]\\r\\nA three-year delay ensued, while the shipyard waited for nickel steel plates for Maine's armor. Bethlehem Steel Company had promised the navy 300 tons per month by December 1889 and had ordered heavy castings and forging presses from the British firm of Armstrong Whitworth in 1886 to fulfil its contract. This equipment did not arrive until 1889, pushing back Bethlehem's timetable. In response, Navy Secretary Benjamin Tracy secured a second contractor, the newly expanded Homestead mill of Carnegie, Phipps & Company. In November 1890, Tracy and Andrew Carnegie signed a contract for Homestead to supply 6000 tons of nickel steel.[42] However, Homestead was, what author Paul Krause calls, \\"the last union stronghold in the steel mills of the Pittsburgh district.\\" The mill had already weathered one strike in 1882 and a lockout in 1889 in an effort to break the union there. Less than two years later, came the Homestead Strike of 1892, one of the largest, most serious disputes in U.S. labor history.[43]\\r\\nA photo of the christening shows Mrs. Wilmerding striking the bow near the plimsoll line depth of 13 which lead to many comments (much later of course) that the ship was \\"unlucky\\" from the launching.\\r\\nMaine was commissioned on 17 September 1895, under the command of Captain Arent S. Crowninshield.[44] On 5 November 1895, Maine steamed to Sandy Hook Bay, New Jersey. She anchored there two days, then proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, for fitting out and test firing of her torpedoes. After a trip, later that month, to Portland, Maine, she reported to the North Atlantic Squadron for operations, training manoeuvres and fleet exercises. Maine spent her active career with the North Atlantic Squadron, operating from Norfolk, Virginia along the East Coast of the United States and the Caribbean. On 10 April 1897, Captain Charles Dwight Sigsbee relieved Captain Crowninshield as commander of Maine.[45]\\r\\nThe ship's crew consisted of 355: 26 officers, 290 sailors, and 39 marines. Of these, there were 261 fatalities:\\r\\nOf the 94 survivors, 16 were uninjured.[46]\\r\\nIn January 1898, Maine was sent from Key West, Florida, to Havana, Cuba, to protect U.S. interests during the Cuban War of Independence. Three weeks later, at 21:40, on 15 February, an explosion on board Maine occurred in the Havana Harbor (coordinates: 230807N 822038W).[47] Later investigations revealed that more than 5 long tons (5.1?t) of powder charges for the vessel's six- and ten-inch guns had detonated, obliterating the forward third of the ship.[48] The remaining wreckage rapidly settled to the bottom of the harbor. Most of Maine's crew were sleeping or resting in the enlisted quarters, in the forward part of the ship, when the explosion occurred. In total, 260[49] men lost their lives as a result of the explosion or shortly thereafter, and six[49] more died later from injuries. Captain Sigsbee and most of the officers survived, because their quarters were in the aft portion of the ship. Altogether there were 89 survivors, 18 of whom were officers.[50] On 21 March, the U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry, in Key West, declared that a naval mine caused the explosion.[51]\\r\\nThe New York Journal and New York World, owned respectively by William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, gave Maine intense press coverage, but employed tactics that would later be labeled \\"yellow journalism.\\" Both papers exaggerated and distorted any information they could attain, sometimes even fabricating news when none that fit their agenda was available. For a week following the sinking, the Journal devoted a daily average of eight and a half pages of news, editorials and pictures to the event. Its editors sent a full team of reporters and artists to Havana, including Frederic Remington,[52] and Hearst announced a reward of $50,000 \\"for the conviction of the criminals who sent 258 American sailors to their deaths.\\"[53] The World, while overall not as lurid or shrill in tone as the Journal, nevertheless indulged in similar theatrics, insisting continually that Maine had been bombed or mined. Privately, Pulitzer believed that \\"nobody outside a lunatic asylum\\" really believed that Spain sanctioned Maine's destruction. Nevertheless, this did not stop the World from insisting that the only \\"atonement\\" Spain could offer the U.S. for the loss of ship and life, was the granting of complete Cuban independence. Nor did it stop the paper from accusing Spain of \\"treachery, willingness, or laxness\\" for failing to ensure the safety of Havana Harbor.[54] The American public, already agitated over reported Spanish atrocities in Cuba, was driven to increased hysteria.[55]\\r\\nMaine's destruction did not result in an immediate declaration of war with Spain. However, the event created an atmosphere that virtually precluded a peaceful solution.[56] The SpanishÿAmerican War began in April 1898, two months after the sinking. Advocates of the war used the rallying cry, \\"Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!\\"[57][58][59][60] The episode focused national attention on the crisis in Cuba, but was not cited by the William McKinley administration as a casus belli, though it was cited by some already inclined to go to war with Spain over perceived atrocities and loss of control in Cuba.[61][62]\\r\\nIn addition to the inquiry commissioned by the Spanish government to naval officers Del Peral and De Salas, two Naval Courts of Inquiry were ordered: The Sampson Board in 1898 and the Vreeland board in 1911. In 1976, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover commissioned a private investigation into the explosion, and the National Geographic Society did an investigation in 1999, using computer simulations. All investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship, but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded.[62][63]\\r\\nThe Spanish inquiry, conducted by Del Peral and De Salas, collected evidence from officers of naval artillery, who had examined the remains of Maine. Del Peral and De Salas identified the spontaneous combustion of the coal bunker, located adjacent to the munition stores in Maine, as the likely cause of the explosion. However, the possibility of other combustibles causing the explosion such as paint or drier products was not discounted. Additional observations included that:\\r\\nThe conclusions of the report were not reported at that time by the American press.[64]\\r\\nIn order to find the cause of the explosion, a naval inquiry was ordered by the United States shortly after the incident, headed by Captain William T. Sampson. Ram܇n Blanco y Erenas, Spanish governor of Cuba, had proposed instead a joint Spanish-American investigation of the sinking.[65] Captain Sigsbee had written that \\"many Spanish officers, including representatives of General Blanco, now with us to express sympathy.\\"[66] In a cable, the Spanish minister of colonies, Segismundo Moret, had advised Blanco \\"to gather every fact you can, to prove the Maine catastrophe cannot be attributed to us.\\"[67]\\r\\nAccording to Dana Wegner, who worked with U.S. Admiral Hyman G. Rickover on his 1974 investigation of the sinking, the Secretary of the Navy had the option of selecting a board of inquiry personally. Instead, he fell back on protocol and assigned the commander-in-chief of the North Atlantic Squadron to do so. The commander produced a list of junior line officers for the board. The fact that the officer proposed to be court president was junior to the captain of Maine, Wegner writes, \\"would indicate either ignorance of navy regulations or that, in the beginning, the board did not intend to examine the possibility that the ship was lost by accident and the negligence of her captain.\\"[this quote needs a citation] Eventually, navy regulations prevailed in leadership of the board; Captain Sampson being senior to Captain Sigsbee.[68]\\r\\nThe board arrived on 21 February and took testimony from survivors, witnesses and divers (who were sent down to investigate the wreck). The Sampson Board produced its findings in two parts: the proceedings, which consisted mainly of testimonies, and the findings, which were the facts, as determined by the court. Between the proceedings and the findings, there was, what Wegner calls, \\"a broad gap\\", where the court \\"left no record of the reasoning that carried it from the oftenÿinconsistent witnesses to [its] conclusion.\\" Another inconsistency, according to Wegner, was that of only one technical witness, Commander George Converse, from the Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island. Captain Sampson read Commander Converse a hypothetical situation of a coal bunker fire igniting the reserve six-inch ammunition, with a resulting explosion sinking the ship. He then asked Commander Converse about the feasibility of such a scenario. Commander Converse \\"simply stated, without elaboration, that he could not realize such an event happening\\".[69]\\r\\nThe board concluded that Maine had been blown up by a mine, which, in turn, caused the explosion of her forward magazines. They reached this conclusion, based on the fact that the majority of witnesses stated that they had heard two explosions and that that part of the keel was bent inwards.[62] The official report from the board, which was presented to the Navy Department in Washington, D.C. on 21 March, specifically stated the following:\\r\\nAt frame 18 the vertical keel is broken in two and the flat keel is bent at an angle similar to the angle formed by the outside bottom plating. [...] In the opinion of the court, this effect could have been produced only by the explosion of a mine situated under the bottom of the ship at about frame 18, and somewhat on the port side of the ship.\\" (part of the court's 5th finding)\\r\\n\\"In the opinion of the court, the Maine was destroyed by the explosion of a submarine mine, which caused the partial explosion of two or more of her forward magazines.\\" (the court's 7th finding) and\\r\\n\\"The court has been unable to obtain evidence fixing the responsibility for the destruction of the Maine upon any person or persons.\\" (the court's 8th finding).[51]\\r\\nIn 1910, the decision was made to do a second Court of Inquiry. The reasons for this were the recovery of the bodies of the victims, so they could be buried in the United States and also a desire for a more thorough investigation. The fact that the Cuban government wanted the wreck removed from Havana Harbor might also have played a role: it at least offered the opportunity to examine the wreck in greater detail than had been possible in 1898, while simultaneously obliging the Cubans. Wegner suggests that the fact that this inquiry could be held without the pending risk of war, which had been the case in 1898, lent it the potential for greater objectivity than had been possible previously. Moreover, since several of the members of the 1910 board would be certified engineers, they would be better qualified to evaluate their findings than the line officers of the 1898 board had been.[70]\\r\\nBeginning in December 1910, a cofferdam was built around the wreck and water was pumped out, exposing the wreck by late 1911. Between 20 November and 2 December 1911, a court of inquiry headed by Rear Admiral Charles E. Vreeland inspected the wreck. They concluded that an external explosion had triggered the explosion of the magazines. However, this explosion was farther aft and lower powered than concluded by the Sampson Board. The Vreeland Board also found that the bending of frame 18 was caused by the explosion of the magazines, not by the external explosion.[62] After the investigation, the newly located dead were buried in Arlington National Cemetery and the hollow, intact portion of the hull of Maine was refloated and ceremoniously scuttled at sea on 16 March 1912.[71]\\r\\nAdmiral Hyman G. Rickover became intrigued with the disaster and began a private investigation, in 1974. Using information from the two official inquiries, newspapers, personal papers and information on the construction and ammunition of Maine, it was concluded that the explosion was not caused by a mine. Instead, spontaneous combustion of coal in the bunker, next to magazine, was speculated to be the most likely cause. Rickover published a book about this investigation, How the Battleship Maine Was Destroyed, in 1976.[72]\\r\\nIn the 2001 book Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. Navy and the SpanishÿAmerican War, Wegner revisits the Rickover investigation and offers additional details. According to Wegner, Rickover inquired with naval historians, at the Energy Research and Development Agency, about Maine, after reading an article in the Washington Star-News in which its author, John M. Taylor, claimed the U.S. Navy \\"made little use of its technically trained officers during its investigation of the tragedy.\\" The historians, then working with the admiral on a study of the U.S. Navy's nuclear propulsion program, said they knew no details of Maine's sinking. When Rickover asked whether they could investigate the matter, the historians, now intrigued, agreed. Knowing of Rickover's \\"insistence on thoroughness,\\" Wegner says, all relevant documents were obtained and studied. These included the ship's plans and weekly reports of the unwatering of Maine, in 1912, by the chief engineer for the project, William Furgueson. These reports included numerous photos, annotated by Furgueson with frame and strake numbers on corresponding parts of the wreckage. Two experts on naval demolitions and ship explosions were brought in. Since the photos showed \\"no plausible evidence of penetration from the outside,\\" they believed the explosion originated inside the ship.[73]\\r\\nWegner suggests that a combination of naval ship design, and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships, might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the Rickover study. Up to the time of Maine's building, he explains, common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers and American naval ships burned primarily smokeless anthracite coal. With an increase in the number of steel ships, the U.S. Navy switched to bituminous coal, which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal, and allowed ships to steam faster. However, Wegner explains, while anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion, bituminous coal is considerably more volatile. In fact, bituminous coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp, a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases (chiefly methane). Firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most violence at around 10%. In addition, there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal ÿ this was iron sulfide, also known as pyrite, that was likely present. The presence of pyrites presents two additional risk factors. The first involves oxidation. Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine. This process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams, or other processing, which then exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water. The presence of pyrites in coal has been recognized to be self-heating. The second risk factor involves an additional capability of pyrites to provide fire ignition under certain conditions. Pyrites, which derive their name from the Greek root word pyr, which means fire, can cause sparks when struck by steel or other sufficiently hard surfaces. Before the use of flintlock guns, for example, pyrites were used to strike sparks to ignite gunpowder in an earlier model type gun, known as a wheellock. In the presence of combustible gasses issuing from the bituminous coal, the pyrites could therefore have provided the ignition capability needed to create an explosion. A number of bunker fires of this type had, in fact, been reported aboard U.S. warships before Maine's explosion, in several cases nearly sinking the ships. Wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a coal bunker fire, of the type suggested by Rickover, could have taken place and ignited the ship's ammunition.[74]\\r\\nIn 1998, National Geographic magazine commissioned an analysis by Advanced Marine Enterprises (AME). This investigation, done to commemorate the centennial of the sinking of USS Maine, was based on computer modeling, a technique unavailable for previous investigations. The results reached were inconclusive. National Geographic reported that \\"a fire in the coal bunker could have generated sufficient heat to touch off an explosion in the adjacent magazine [but] on the other hand, computer analysis also shows that even a small, handmade mine could have penetrated the ship's hull and set off explosions within.\\"[75] The AME investigation, however, did note that \\"the size and location of the soil depression beneath the Maine 'is more readily explained by a mine explosion than by magazine explosions alone'\\".[63] The team noted that this was not \\"definitive in proving that a mine was the cause of the sinking\\" although it did \\"strengthen the case\\".[63]\\r\\nSome experts, including Admiral Rickover's team and several analysts at AME, do not agree with the conclusion.[63] Wegner claims that technical opinion among the Geographic team was divided between its younger members, who focused on computer modeling results, and its older ones, who weighed their inspection of photos of the wreck with their own experience. He adds that the data AME used for its findings were flawed concerning Maine's design and ammunition storage. Wegner was also critical of the fact that participants in the Rickover study were not consulted until AME's analysis was essentially complete, far too late to confirm the veracity of data being used or engage in any other meaningful cooperation.[76]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Discovery Channel produced an episode of the Unsolved History documentaries titled \\"Death of the U.S.S. Maine\\" that used photographic evidence, naval experts, and archival information to determine the cause of the explosion. Its conclusion was that a coal bunker fire caused the explosion, and it identified a weakness or gap in the bulkhead separating the coal and powder bunkers that allowed the fire to spread from the coal bunker to the powder bunker.\\r\\nIt has been suggested by some that the sinking was a false flag operation conducted by the U.S. This is the official view in Cuba. Cuban officials argue that the U.S. may have deliberately sunk the ship to create a pretext for military action against Spain. The wording on the Maine monument in Havana describes Maine's sailors as \\"victims sacrificed to the imperialist greed in its fervor to seize control of Cuba\\",[77] which alludes to the theory that U.S. agents deliberately blew up their own ship.[78]\\r\\nEliades Acosta, a prominent Cuban historian, head of the Cuban Communist Party's Committee on Culture and former director of the Jose Marti National Library in Havana, offered the standard Cuban interpretation of the sinking of the Maine (that the United States itself probably did it) in an interview to The New York Times. But Acosta adds that \\"Americans died for the freedom of Cuba, and that should be recognized. But others wanted to annex Cuba, and that should be criticized. If relations with the United States improve, all these things can be re-examined more fairly\\".[79] This claim has also been made in Russia. Mikhail Khazin, a Russian economist who once ran the cultural section at Komsomolskaya Pravda, speaking in a 2008 Pravda interview of the need in troubled times to change the psychology of society, to unite it, said that \\"the Americans blew up their own battleship Maine.\\"[80]\\r\\nOperation Northwoods was a series of proposals prepared by Pentagon officials for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962, setting out a number of proposed false flag operations that could be blamed on the Cuban Communists in order to rally support against them.[81][82] One of these suggested that a U.S. Navy ship be blown up in Guantanamo Bay deliberately. In an echo of the yellow press headlines of the earlier period, the specific phrase \\"A 'Remember the Maine' incident\\" was used.[82][83]\\r\\nFor several years, Maine was left where she sank in Havana Harbor, although it was evident she would have to be removed sometime. Maine took up valuable space and the buildup of silt around her hull threatened to create a shoal. In addition, various patriotic groups wanted mementos of the ship. On 9 May 1910, Congress authorized funds for the removal of Maine, the proper interment in Arlington National Cemetery of the estimated 70 bodies still inside, and the removal and transport of the main mast to Arlington. Congress did not demand a new investigation into the sinking at that time.[84]\\r\\nThe Army Corps of Engineers built a cofferdam around Maine and pumped water out from inside it.[4] By 30 June 1911, Maine's main deck was exposed. The ship forward of frame 41 was entirely destroyed; a twisted mass of steel out of line with the rest of the hull, all that was left of the bow, bore no resemblance to a ship. The rest of the wreck was badly corroded. Army engineers dismantled the damaged superstructure and decks, which were then dumped at sea. About halfway between bow and stern, they built a concrete and wooden bulkhead to seal the after-section, then cut away what was left of the forward portion. Holes were cut in the bottom of the after-section, through which jets of water were pumped, to break the mud seal holding the ship, then plugged, with flood cocks, which would later be used for sinking the ship.[85]\\r\\nThe Maine had been outfitted with Worthington steam pumps. Although lying on the bottom of Havana Harbor for fourteen years these pumps were found to be still operational, and were subsequently used to raise the ship. (Worthington Pump History, 1840ÿ1940)\\r\\nOn 13 February 1912, the engineers let water back into the interior of the cofferdam. Three days later, the interior of the cofferdam was full and Maine floated. Two days after that, Maine was towed out by the tug Osceola. The bodies of its crew were then removed to the armored cruiser North Carolina for repatriation. On 16 March, Maine was towed four miles from the Cuban coast by Osceola, escorted by North Carolina and the light cruiser Birmingham. Its sea cocks were opened and it sank in 600 fathoms (3,600?ft; 1,100?m) of water to the salutes of Birmingham and North Carolina.[86][87] During the salvage, remains of 66 more were found, of whom only one (an engineering officer) was identified and returned to his home town; the rest were reburied at Arlington Cemetery making a total of 229 buried there.[88]\\r\\nIn 2000, the wreck of Maine was rediscovered by Advanced Digital Communications, a Toronto-based expedition company, in about 3,770 feet (1,150 m) of water roughly 3 miles (4.8?km) northeast of Havana Harbor. The company had been working with Cuban scientists and oceanographers from the University of South Florida College of Marine Science, on testing underwater exploration technology. The ship had been discovered east of where it was believed it had been scuttled; according to the researchers, during the sinking ceremony and the time it took the wreck to founder, currents pushed the Maine east until it came to rest at its present location. Before the team identified the site as Maine, they referred to the location as the \\"square\\" due to its unique shape, and at first they did not believe it was the ship, due to its unexpected location. The site was explored with an ROV. According to Dr. Frank Muller-Karger, the hull was not oxidized and the crew could \\"see all of its structural parts\\".[89] The expedition was able to identify the ship due to the doors and hatches on the wreck, as well as the anchor chain, the shape of the propellers, and the holes where the bow was cut off. Due to the 1912 raising of the ship, the wreck was completely missing its bow; this tell-tale feature was instrumental in identifying the ship. The team also located a boiler nearby, and a debris field of coal.[89]\\r\\nIn February 1898, the recovered bodies of sailors who died on Maine were interred in the Colon Cemetery, Havana. Some injured sailors were sent to hospitals in Havana and Key West, Florida. Those who died in hospitals were buried in Key West. In December 1899, the bodies in Havana were disinterred and brought back to the United States for burial at Arlington National Cemetery.[90] In 1915, President Woodrow Wilson dedicated the USS Maine Mast Memorial to those who died. The memorial includes the ship's main mast. Roughly 165 were buried at Arlington, although the remains of one sailor were exhumed for his home town, Indianapolis, Indiana. Of the rest, only 62 were known.[88] Nine bodies were never recovered and 19 crewmen, several unidentified, are buried in Key West Cemetery under a statue of a U.S. Sailor holding an oar.[c]\\r\\nMemorial at Arlington National Cemetery centered on the ship's main mast\\r\\nThe Cuban Friendship Urn on Ohio Drive, Southwest, Washington, D.C., East Potomac Park\\r\\nMonument to victims of Maine in Havana, Cuba, c. 1930\\r\\nA gun from Maine at Fort Allen Park, Portland, Maine\\r\\nU.S. Battleship Maine Monument Key West Cemetery, Florida\\r\\nThe explosion-bent fore mast of Maine is located at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.[91][92]\\r\\nIn 1926, the Cuban government erected a memorial to the victims of Maine on the Malecon, near the Hotel Nacional, to commemorate United States assistance in acquiring Cuban independence from Spain. The memorial was damaged by crowds, following the Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, and the eagle on top was broken and removed.[93] The Communist government then added its own inscription blaming \\"imperialist voracity in its eagerness to seize the island of Cuba\\" for Maine's sinking.[93][94] The monument was cleaned and restored in 2013. However, the eagle's head was retained by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, and the body by the city's museum.[95]\\r\\nUSS Maine Monument in New York City\\r\\nUSS Maine Monument, Columbus Circle, NYC\\r\\nColumbia Triumphant\\r\\nMemorial plaque by Charles Keck, USS Maine Memorial\\r\\nSculpture group by Attilio Piccirilli at USS Maine Memorial\\r\\nColumbia Triumphant sculpture group atop USS Maine Memorial\\r\\nA 6-inch deck gun from Maine is on the North lawn of the South Carolina State House in Columbia, SC.\\r\\nA bronze torpedo tube and armoured hatch form part of a memorial in West Park, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, just south of West North Avenue, http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM769B_Maine_Memorial_Pittsburgh_PA\\r\\nThere is also a U.S.S.

A child prodigy, he is considered to be one of the most critically and commercially successful musical performers of the late 20th century.[2] Wonder signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of 11,[2] and he continued performing and recording for Motown into the 2010s. He has been blind since shortly after birth.[3]\\r\\nAmong Wonder's works are singles such as \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\\", \\"Superstition\\", \\"Sir Duke\\", \\"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\\" and \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\\"; and albums such as Talking Book, Innervisions and Songs in the Key of Life.[2] He has recorded more than 30 U.S. top ten hits and received 25 Grammy Awards, one of the most-awarded male solo artists, and has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the top 60 best-selling music artists.[4] Wonder is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a holiday in the United States.[5] In 2009, Wonder was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace.[6] In 2013, Billboard magazine released a list of the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists to celebrate the US singles chart's 55th anniversary, with Wonder at number six.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStevie Wonder was born in Saginaw, Michigan, in 1950, the third of six children of Calvin Judkins and Lula Mae Hardaway, a songwriter. He was born six weeks premature which, along with the oxygen-rich atmosphere in the hospital incubator, resulted in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a condition in which the growth of the eyes is aborted and causes the retinas to detach; so he became blind.[3][8] When Wonder was four, his mother divorced his father and moved to Detroit with her children. She changed her name back to Lula Hardaway and later changed her son's surname to Morris, partly because of relatives. Wonder has retained Morris as his legal surname. He began playing instruments at an early age, including piano, harmonica and drums. He formed a singing partnership with a friend; calling themselves Stevie and John, they played on street corners, and occasionally at parties and dances.[9]\\r\\nWonder sang as a child in a choir at the Whitestone Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan.[10]\\r\\nIn 1961, when aged 11, Wonder sang his own composition, \\"Lonely Boy\\", to Ronnie White of the Miracles;[11][12] White then took Wonder and his mother to an audition at Motown, where CEO Berry Gordy signed Wonder to Motown's Tamla label.[1] Before signing, producer Clarence Paul gave him the name Little Stevie Wonder.[3] Because of Wonder's age, the label drew up a rolling five-year contract in which royalties would be held in trust until Wonder was 21. He and his mother would be paid a weekly stipend to cover their expenses: Wonder received $2.50 (equivalent to $20.47 in 2017) per week, and a private tutor was provided for when Wonder was on tour.[12]\\r\\nWonder was put in the care of producer and songwriter Clarence Paul, and for a year they worked together on two albums. Tribute to Uncle Ray was recorded first, when Wonder was still 11 years old. Mainly covers of Ray Charles's songs, it included a Wonder and Paul composition, \\"Sunset\\". The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie was recorded next, an instrumental album consisting mainly of Paul's compositions, two of which, \\"Wondering\\" and \\"Session Number 112\\", were co-written with Wonder.[13] Feeling Wonder was now ready, a song, \\"Mother Thank You\\", was recorded for release as a single, but then pulled and replaced by the Berry Gordy song \\"I Call It Pretty Music, But the Old People Call It the Blues\\" as his dbut single;[14] released summer 1962,[15] it almost broke into the Billboard 100, spending one week of August at 101 before dropping out of sight.[16] Two follow-up singles, \\"Little Water Boy\\" and \\"Contract on Love\\", both had no success, and the two albums, released in reverse order of recordingThe Jazz Soul of Little Stevie in September 1962 and Tribute to Uncle Ray in October 1962also met with little success.[13][17]\\r\\nAt the end of 1962, when Wonder was 12 years old, he joined the Motortown Revue, touring the \\"chitlin' circuit\\" of theatres across America that accepted black artists. At the Regal Theater, Chicago, his 20-minute performance was recorded and released in May 1963 as the album Recorded Live: The 12 Year Old Genius.[13] A single, \\"Fingertips\\", from the album was also released in May, and became a major hit.[18] The song, featuring a confident and enthusiastic Wonder returning for a spontaneous encore that catches out the replacement bass player, who is heard to call out \\"What key? What key?\\",[18][19] was a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 when Wonder was aged 13, making him the youngest artist ever to top the chart.[20] The single was simultaneously No. 1 on the R&B chart, the first time that had occurred.[21] His next few recordings, however, were not successful; his voice was changing as he got older, and some Motown executives were considering cancelling his recording contract.[21] During 1964, Wonder appeared in two films as himself, Muscle Beach Party and Bikini Beach, but these were not successful either.[22] Sylvia Moy persuaded label owner Berry Gordy to give Wonder another chance.[21] Dropping the \\"Little\\" from his name, Moy and Wonder worked together to create the hit \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\",[21] and Wonder went on to have a number of other hits during the mid-1960s, including \\"With a Child's Heart\\", and \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\",[19] a Bob Dylan cover, co-sung by his mentor, producer Clarence Paul.[23] He also began to work in the Motown songwriting department, composing songs both for himself and his label mates, including \\"The Tears of a Clown\\", a No. 1 hit for Smokey Robinson and the Miracles (it was first released in 1967, mostly unnoticed as the last track of their Make It Happen LP, but eventually became a major success when re-released as a single in 1970, which prompted Robinson to reconsider his intention of leaving the group).[24]\\r\\nIn 1968 he recorded an album of instrumental soul/jazz tracks, mostly harmonica solos, under the title Eivets Rednow, which is \\"Stevie Wonder\\" spelled backwards.[25] The album failed to get much attention, and its only single, a cover of \\"Alfie\\", only reached number 66 on the U.S. Pop charts and number 11 on the US Adult Contemporary charts. Nonetheless, he managed to score several hits between 1968 and 1970 such as \\"I Was Made to Love Her\\",[23] \\"For Once in My Life\\" and \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\\". A number of Wonder's early hits, including \\"My Cherie Amour\\", \\"I Was Made to Love Her\\", and \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\", were co-written with Henry Cosby.\\r\\nIn September 1970, at the age of 20, Wonder married Syreeta Wright, a songwriter and former Motown secretary. Wright and Wonder worked together on the next album, Where I'm Coming From; Wonder writing the music, and Wright helping with the lyrics.[26] They wanted to \\"touch on the social problems of the world\\", and for the lyrics \\"to mean something\\".[26] It was released at around the same time as Marvin Gaye's What's Going On. As both albums had similar ambitions and themes, they have been compared; in a contemporaneous review by Vince Aletti in Rolling Stone, Gaye's was seen as successful, while Wonder's was seen as failing due to \\"self-indulgent and cluttered\\" production, \\"undistinguished\\" and \\"pretentious\\" lyrics, and an overall lack of unity and flow.[27] Also in 1970, Wonder co-wrote, and played numerous instruments on the hit \\"It's a Shame\\" for fellow Motown act the Spinners. His contribution was meant to be a showcase of his talent and thus a weapon in his ongoing negotiations with Gordy about creative autonomy.[28] Reaching his 21st birthday on May 13, 1971, he allowed his Motown contract to expire.[29]\\r\\nDuring this period, Wonder independently recorded two albums and signed a new contract with Motown Records. The 120-page contract was a precedent at Motown and gave Wonder a much higher royalty rate.[30] Wonder returned to Motown in March 1972 with Music of My Mind. Unlike most previous albums on Motown, which usually consisted of a collection of singles, B-sides and covers, Music of My Mind was a full-length artistic statement with songs flowing together thematically.[30] Wonder's lyrics dealt with social, political, and mystical themes as well as standard romantic ones, while musically he began exploring overdubbing and recording most of the instrumental parts himself.[30] Music of My Mind marked the beginning of a long collaboration with Tonto's Expanding Head Band (Robert Margouleff and Malcolm Cecil).[31][32]\\r\\nReleased in late 1972, Talking Book featured the No. 1 hit \\"Superstition\\",[33] which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the Hohner Clavinet keyboard.[34] Talking Book also featured \\"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\\", which also peaked at No. 1. During the same time as the album's release, Wonder began touring with the Rolling Stones to alleviate the negative effects from pigeonholing as a result of being an R&B artist in America.[11] Wonder's touring with the Stones was also a factor behind the success of both \\"Superstition\\" and \\"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\\".[30][35] Between them, the two songs won three Grammy Awards.[36] On an episode of the children's television show Sesame Street that aired in April 1973,[37] Wonder and his band performed \\"Superstition\\", as well as an original called \\"Sesame Street Song\\", which demonstrated his abilities with television.\\r\\nInnervisions, released in 1973, featured \\"Higher Ground\\" (No. 4 on the pop charts) as well as the trenchant \\"Living for the City\\" (No. 8).[33] Both songs reached No. 1 on the R&B charts. Popular ballads such as \\"Golden Lady\\" and \\"All in Love Is Fair\\" were also present, in a mixture of moods that nevertheless held together as a unified whole.[38] Innervisions generated three more Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year.[36] The album is ranked No. 23 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[39] Wonder had become the most influential and acclaimed black musician of the early 1970s.[30]\\r\\nOn August 6, 1973, Wonder was in a serious automobile accident while on tour in North Carolina, when a car in which he was riding hit the back of a truck.[30][40] This left him in a coma for four days and resulted in a partial loss of his sense of smell and a temporary loss of sense of taste.[41] Despite the setback, Wonder re-appeared for a European tour in early 1974, performing at the Midem convention in Cannes, at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and on the German television show Musikladen.[42] On his return from Europe, he played a sold-out concert at Madison Square Garden in March 1974, highlighting both up-tempo material and long, building improvisations on mid-tempo songs such as \\"Living for the City\\".[30] The album Fulfillingness' First Finale appeared in July 1974 and set two hits high on the pop charts: the No. 1 \\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\\" and the Top Ten \\"Boogie on Reggae Woman\\". The Album of the Year was again one of three Grammys won.[36]\\r\\nThe same year Wonder took part in a Los Angeles jam session that would become known as the bootleg album A Toot and a Snore in '74.[43][44] He also co-wrote and produced the Syreeta Wright album Stevie Wonder Presents: Syreeta.[45][46]\\r\\nOn October 4, 1975, Wonder performed at the historic \\"Wonder Dream Concert\\" in Kingston, Jamaica, a benefit for the Jamaican Institute for the Blind.[47]\\r\\nBy 1975, at age 25, Wonder had won two consecutive Grammy Awards: in 1974 for Innervisions and in 1975 for Fulfillingness' First Finale.[48] In 1975, he played harmonica on two tracks on Billy Preston's album It's My Pleasure.\\r\\nThe double album-with-extra-EP Songs in the Key of Life was released in September 1976. Sprawling in style, unlimited in ambition, and sometimes lyrically difficult to fathom, the album was hard for some listeners to assimilate, yet is regarded by many as Wonder's crowning achievement and one of the most recognizable and accomplished albums in pop music history.[30][33][49] The album became the first by an American artist to debut straight at No. 1 in the Billboard charts, where it stood for 14 non-consecutive weeks.[50] Two tracks became No. 1 Pop/R&B hits \\"I Wish\\" and \\"Sir Duke\\". The baby-celebratory \\"Isn't She Lovely?\\" was written about his newborn daughter Aisha, while songs such as \\"Love's in Need of Love Today\\" and \\"Village Ghetto Land\\" reflected a far more pensive mood. Songs in the Key of Life won Album of the Year and two other Grammys.[36] The album ranks 57th on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[39]\\r\\nUntil 1979's Stevie Wonder's Journey Through \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\" his only release was the retrospective three-disc album Looking Back, an anthology of his early Motown period.\\r\\nThe 1980s saw Wonder achieving his biggest hits and highest level of fame; he had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations, political impact, and television appearances. The 1979 mainly instrumental soundtrack album Stevie Wonder's Journey Through \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\" was composed using an early music sampler, a Computer Music Melodian.[51] Wonder toured briefly in support of the album, and used a Fairlight CMI sampler on stage.[52] In this year Wonder also wrote and produced the dance hit \\"Let's Get Serious\\", performed by Jermaine Jackson and (ranked by Billboard as the No. 1 R&B single of 1980).\\r\\nHotter than July (1980) became Wonder's first platinum-selling single album, and its single \\"Happy Birthday\\" was a successful vehicle for his campaign to establish Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday as a national holiday. The album also included \\"Master Blaster (Jammin')\\", \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand for It\\", and the sentimental ballad, \\"Lately\\".\\r\\nIn 1982, Wonder released a retrospective of his 1970s work with Stevie Wonder's Original Musiquarium, which included four new songs: the ten-minute funk classic \\"Do I Do\\" (which featured Dizzy Gillespie), \\"That Girl\\" (one of the year's biggest singles to chart on the R&B side), \\"Front Line\\", a narrative about a soldier in the Vietnam War that Wonder wrote and sang in the first person, and \\"Ribbon in the Sky\\", one of his many classic compositions. He also gained a No. 1 hit that year in collaboration with Paul McCartney in their paean to racial harmony, \\"Ebony and Ivory\\".\\r\\nIn 1983, Wonder performed the song \\"Stay Gold\\", the theme to Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptation of S. E. Hinton's novel The Outsiders. Wonder wrote the lyrics. In 1983, he scheduled an album to be entitled People Work, Human Play. The album never surfaced and instead 1984 saw the release of Wonder's soundtrack album for The Woman in Red. The lead single, \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\\", was a No. 1 pop and R&B hit in both the United States and the United Kingdom, where it was placed 13th in the list of best-selling singles in the UK published in 2002. (The single was also a hit in lots of other countries as well). It went on to win an Academy award for best song in 1985. Wonder accepted the award in the name of Nelson Mandela and was subsequently banned from all South African radio by the Government of South Africa.[53] Incidentally, on the occasion of his 35th birthday, Stevie Wonder was honored by the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid for his stance against racism in South Africa that same year (1985).[54] The album also featured a guest appearance by Dionne Warwick, singing the duet \\"It's You\\" with Stevie and a few songs of her own. Following the success of the album and its lead single,Wonder made an appearance on The Cosby Show,in the episode \\"A Touch of Wonder\\" where he demonstrated his ability to sample. The following year's In Square Circle featured the No. 1 pop hit \\"Part-Time Lover\\". The album also has a Top 10 Hit with \\"Go Home.\\" It also featured the ballad \\"Overjoyed\\", which was originally written for Journey Through \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\", but did not make the album. He performed \\"Overjoyed\\" on Saturday Night Live when he was the host. He was also featured in Chaka Khan's cover of Prince's \\"I Feel For You\\", alongside Melle Mel, playing his signature harmonica. In roughly the same period he was also featured on harmonica on Eurythmics' single, \\"There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)\\" and Elton John's \\"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\\".\\r\\nWonder was in a featured duet with Bruce Springsteen on the all-star charity single for African Famine Relief, \\"We Are the World\\", and he was part of another charity single the following year (1986), the AIDS-inspired \\"That's What Friends Are For\\". He played harmonica on the album Dreamland Express by John Denver in the song \\"If Ever\\", a song Wonder co-wrote with Stephanie Andrews; wrote the track \\"I Do Love You\\" for the Beach Boys' 1985 self-titled album; and played harmonica on \\"Can't Help Lovin' That Man\\" on The Broadway Album by Barbra Streisand. In 1987, Wonder appeared on Michael Jackson's Bad album, on the duet \\"Just Good Friends\\". Michael Jackson also sang a duet with him entitled \\"Get It\\" on Wonder's 1987 album Characters. This was a minor hit single, as were \\"Skeletons\\" and \\"You Will Know\\".\\r\\nAfter 1987's Characters album, Wonder continued to release new material, but at a slower pace. He recorded a soundtrack album for Spike Lee's film Jungle Fever in 1991. From this album, singles and videos were released for \\"Gotta Have You\\", \\"Fun Day\\"(remix only), \\"These Three Words\\" and \\"Jungle Fever\\" . The B-side to the \\"Gotta Have You\\" single was \\"Feeding Off The Love of the Land\\", which was played during the end credits of the movie Jungle Fever but was not included on the soundtrack. A piano and vocal version of \\"Feeding Off The Love of the Land\\" was also released on the Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal compilation. Conversation Peace and the live album Natural Wonder were released in the 1990s.[55]\\r\\nAmong his other activities he played harmonica on one track for the 1994 tribute album Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved;[56] sang at the 1996 Summer Olympics closing ceremony;[57] collaborated in 1997 with Babyface on \\"How Come, How Long\\", a song about domestic violence that was nominated for a Grammy award;[58] and played harmonica on Sting's 1999 \\"Brand New Day\\".[59] In December 1999, Wonder announced that he was interested in pursuing an intraocular retinal prosthesis to partially restore his sight.[60]\\r\\nInto the 21st century, Wonder continues to record and perform; though mainly occasional appearances and guest performances, he did do two tours, and released one album of new material, 2005's A Time to Love. His key appearances include performing at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Paralympics in Salt Lake City,[61] the 2005 Live 8 concert in Philadelphia,[62] the pre-game show for Super Bowl XL in 2006, the Obama Inaugural Celebration in 2009, and the opening ceremony of the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Athens, Greece.[63]\\r\\nHe sang at the Michael Jackson memorial service in 2009,[64] at Etta James' funeral, in 2012,[65] and a month later at Whitney Houston's memorial service.[66]\\r\\nWonder's first new album in ten years, A Time to Love, was released in October 2005 to lower sales than previous albums, and lukewarm reviewsmost reviewers appearing frustrated at the end of the long delay to get an album that mainly copied the style of Wonder's \\"classic period\\" without doing anything new.[67] The first single, \\"So What the Fuss\\", was released in April. A second single, \\"From the Bottom of My Heart\\", was a hit on adult-contemporary R&B radio. The album also featured a duet with India Arie on the title track \\"A Time to Love\\". By June 2008, Wonder was working on two projects simultaneously: a new album called The Gospel Inspired By Lula, which will deal with the various spiritual and cultural crises facing the world, and Through The Eyes Of Wonder, an album he has described as a performance piece that will reflect his experience as a blind man. Wonder was also keeping the door open for a collaboration with Tony Bennett and Quincy Jones concerning a rumored jazz album.[68] If Wonder were to join forces with Bennett, it would not be for the first time; their rendition of \\"For Once in My Life\\" earned them a Grammy for best pop collaboration with vocals in 2006.[36] Wonder's harmonica playing can be heard on the 2009 Grammy-nominated \\"Never Give You Up\\", featuring CJ Hilton and Raphael Saadiq.[69]\\r\\nIn October 2013, Wonder revealed that he had been recording new material for two albums, When the World Began and Ten Billion Hearts, in collaboration with producer David Foster, the albums to be released in 2014.[70] He is featured on two tracks on Mark Ronson's new album Uptown Special.\\r\\nWonder did a 13-date tour of North America in 2007, starting in San Diego on August 23; this was his first U.S. tour in over ten years.[71] On September 8, 2008, Wonder started the European leg of his Wonder Summer's Night Tour, the first time he had toured Europe in over a decade. His opening show was at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. During the tour, Wonder played eight UK gigs; four at the O2 Arena in London (filmed in HD and subsequently released as a live in concert release on DVD and Blu-Ray, \\"Live At Last\\"[72]), two in Birmingham and two at the M.E.N. Arena in Manchester. Wonder's other stops in the tour's European leg also found him performing in the Netherlands (Rotterdam), Sweden (Stockholm), Germany (Cologne, Mannheim and Munich), Norway (Hamar), France (Paris), Italy (Milan) and Denmark (Aalborg). Wonder also toured Australia (Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane) and New Zealand (Christchurch, Auckland and New Plymouth) in October and November.[73] His 2010 tour included a two-hour set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, a stop at London's \\"Hard Rock Calling\\" in Hyde Park, and appearances at England's Glastonbury Festival, Rotterdam's North Sea Jazz Festival, and a concert in Bergen, Norway, and a concert in Dublin, Ireland, at the O2 Arena on June 24.[73]\\r\\nIn 2000, Wonder contributed two new songs to the soundtrack for Spike Lee's Bamboozled album (\\"Misrepresented People\\" and \\"Some Years Ago\\").[74] In June 2006, Wonder made a guest appearance on Busta Rhymes' album The Big Bang, on the track \\"Been through the Storm\\". He sings the refrain and plays the piano on the Dr. Dre and Sha Money XL-produced track. He appeared again on the last track of Snoop Dogg's album Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, \\"Conversations\\". The song is a remake of \\"Have a Talk with God\\" from Songs in the Key of Life. In 2006, Wonder staged a duet with Andrea Bocelli on the latter's album Amore, offering harmonica and additional vocals on \\"Canzoni Stonate\\". Wonder also performed at Washington, D.C.'s 2006 \\"A Capitol Fourth\\" celebration. Wonder appeared on singer Celine Dion's studio album Loved Me Back to Life performing a cover of his 1985 song \\"Overjoyed\\".[75] The album was released in October 2013.\\r\\nA prominent figure in popular music during the latter half of the 20th century, Wonder has recorded more than 30 U.S. top ten hits and won 25 Grammy Awards[36] (the most ever won by a solo artist) as well as a Lifetime Achievement Award. He has also won an Academy Award for Best Song,[76] and been inducted into both the Rock and Roll[77] and Songwriters[78] halls of fame. He has also been awarded the Polar Music Prize.[79] American music magazine Rolling Stone named him the ninth greatest singer of all time.[80][81] In June 2009 he became the fourth artist to receive the Montreal Jazz Festival Spirit Award.[82]\\r\\nHe has had ten U.S. number-one hits on the pop charts as well as 20 R&B number one hits, and has sold over 100 million records, 19.5?million of which are albums;[83] he is one of the top 60 best-selling music artists with combined sales of singles and albums.[4] Wonder has recorded several critically acclaimed albums and hit singles, and writes and produces songs for many of his label mates and outside artists as well. Wonder plays the piano, synthesizer, harmonica, congas, drums, bongos, organ, melodica and Clavinet. In his childhood, he was best known for his harmonica work, but today he is better known for his keyboard skills and vocal ability. Wonder was the first Motown artist and second African-American musician to win an Academy Award for Best Original Song, which he won for his 1984 hit single \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\\" from the movie The Woman in Red.\\r\\nWonder's \\"classic period\\" is generally agreed to be between 1972 and 1977.[84][85][86] Some observers see in 1971's Where I'm Coming From certain indications of the beginning of the classic period, such as its new funky keyboard style which Wonder used throughout the classic period.[86] Some determine Wonder's first \\"classic\\" album to be 1972's Music of My Mind, on which he attained personal control of production, and on which he programmed a series of songs integrated with one another to make a concept album.[86] Others skip over early 1972 and determine the beginning of the classic period to be Talking Book in late 1972,[87] the album in which Wonder \\"hit his stride\\".[86]\\r\\nHis classic 1970s albums were very influential on the music world: the 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide said they \\"pioneered stylistic approaches that helped to determine the shape of pop music for the next decade\\";[33] Rolling Stone's 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time included four of the five albums, with three in the top 90;[39] and in 2005, Kanye West said of his own work, \\"I'm not trying to compete with what's out there now. I'm really trying to compete with Innervisions and Songs in the Key of Life. It sounds musically blasphemous to say something like that, but why not set that as your bar?\\"[88]\\r\\nWonder has been married three times. He was married to Motown singer-songwriter and frequent collaborator Syreeta Wright from 1970 until their amicable divorce in 1972. From 2001 until 2012 he was married to fashion designer Kai Millard.[89] In October 2009, Wonder and Millard separated; Wonder filed for divorce in August 2012.[90] In 2017 he married Tomeeka Bracy.[91]\\r\\nWonder has nine children by five different women.[92] The mother of Wonder's first child is Yolanda Simmons, whom Wonder met when she applied for a job as secretary for his publishing company.[93] Simmons gave birth to Wonder's daughter on February 2, 1975: Aisha Morris.[94][95] After Aisha was born, Stevie said \\"she was the one thing that I needed in my life and in my music for a long time.\\"[93] Aisha was the inspiration for Wonder's hit single \\"Isn't She Lovely?\\" Aisha is a singer who has toured with her father and accompanied him on recordings, including his 2005 album, A Time to Love. Wonder and Simmons had a son, Keita, in 1977.[96]\\r\\nIn 1983 Wonder had a son with Melody McCulley, Mumtaz Morris.[97] Wonder has a daughter, Sophia, and a son, Kwame, with a woman whose identity has not been publicly disclosed.[96]\\r\\nWonder has two sons with second wife Kai Millard Morris; the elder is named Kailand and he occasionally performs as a drummer on stage with his father.

As a result, in 1891, Williams founded the Provident Hospital and training school for nurses in Chicago. This was established mostly for the benefit of African-American residents, to increase their accessibility to health care.[8]\\r\\nIn 1893, Williams became the first African American on record to have successfully performed pericardium surgery to repair a wound. On September 6, 1891,[3][4] Henry Dalton had successfully performed pericardium surgery to repair a wound, with the patient fully recovering.[9] Earlier successful surgeries to drain the pericardium, by performing a pericardiostomy were done by Francisco Romero in 1801[10] and Dominique Jean Larrey in 1810.[11]\\r\\nOn July 10, 1893, Williams repaired the torn pericardium of a knife wound patient, James Cornish.[3] Cornish, who was stabbed directly through the left fifth costal cartilage,[3] had been admitted the previous night. Williams decided to operate the next morning in response to continued bleeding, cough and \\"pronounced\\" symptoms of shock.[3] He performed this surgery, without the benefit of penicillin or blood transfusion, at Provident Hospital, Chicago.[12] It was not reported until 1897.[3] He undertook a second procedure to drain fluid. About fifty days after the initial procedure, Cornish left the hospital.[8]\\r\\nIn 1893, during the administration of President Grover Cleveland, Williams was appointed surgeon-in-chief of Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C., a post he held until 1898. That year he married Alice Johnson, who was born in the city and graduated from Howard University, and moved back to Chicago. In addition to organizing Provident Hospital, Williams also established a training school for African-American nurses at the facility.\\r\\nWilliams was a Professor of Clinical Surgery at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee and was an attending surgeon at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. He worked to create more hospitals that admitted African Americans. In 1895 he co-founded the National Medical Association for African American doctors, and in 1913 he became a charter member and the only African-American doctor in the American College of Surgeons.\\r\\nDaniel Hale Williams was born in 1856 and raised in the city of Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. His father, Daniel Hale Williams, Jr. was the son of a black barber and a Scots-Irish woman.[13] His mother was African American and likely also mixed race.\\r\\nThe fifth child born, Williams lived with his parents, a brother and five sisters. His family eventually moved to Annapolis, Maryland. Shortly after when Williams was nine, his father died of tuberculosis.[14] Williams' mother realized she could not manage the entire family and sent some of the children to live with relatives. Williams was apprenticed to a shoemaker in Baltimore, Maryland but ran away to join his mother, who had moved to Rockford, Illinois. He later moved to Edgerton, Wisconsin, where he joined his sister and opened his own barber shop. After moving to nearby Janesville, Wisconsin, Williams became fascinated by the work of a local physician and decided to follow his path.\\r\\nHe began working as an apprentice to Dr. Henry W. Palmer, studying with him for two years. In 1880 Williams ntered Chicago Medical College, now known as Northwestern University Medical School. After graduation from Northwestern in 1883, he opened his own medical office in Chicago, Illinois.[15]\\r\\nWilliams was married in 1898 to Alice Johnson, natural daughter of American sculptor Moses Jacob Ezekiel and a mixed-race maid.[16] Williams died of a stroke in Idlewild, Michigan on August 4, 1931. His wife, Alice Johnson, had died in 1924.[8]\\r\\nIn the 1890s several attempts were made to improve cardiac surgery. On September 6, 1891 the first successful pericardial sac repair operation in the United States of America was performed by Henry C. Dalton of Saint Louis, Missouri.[17] The first successful surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on September 4, 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo.[18][19] The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Dr. Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896.[20][21] Despite these improvements, heart-related surgery was not widely accepted in the field of medical science until during World War II. Surgeons were forced to improve their methods of surgery in order to repair severe war wounds.[22] Although they did not receive early recognition for their pioneering work, Dalton and Williams were later recognised for their roles in cardiac surgery.[22]\\r\\nWilliams received honorary degrees from Howard and Wilberforce Universities, was named a charter member of the American College of Surgeons, and was a member of the Chicago Surgical Society.\\r\\nA Pennsylvania State Historical Marker was placed at U.S. Route 22 eastbound (Blair St., 300 block), Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, to commemorate his accomplishments and mark his boyhood home.[23]","input":"Who performed the first successful open heart surgery?"},{"output":"to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user","context":"Modelÿviewÿcontroller is commonly used for developing software that divides an application into three interconnected parts. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.[1][2] The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development.\\r\\nTraditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this architecture has become popular for designing web applications and even mobile, desktop and other clients.[3] Popular programming languages like Java, C#, Ruby, PHP and others have popular MVC frameworks that are currently being used in web application development straight out of the box.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with other software patterns, MVC expresses the \\"core of the solution\\" to a problem while allowing it to be adapted for each system.[4] Particular MVC architectures can vary significantly from the traditional description here.[5]\\r\\nIn addition to dividing the application into three kinds of components, the modelÿviewÿcontroller design defines the interactions between them.[8]\\r\\nOne of the seminal insights in the early development of graphical user interfaces, MVC became one of the first approaches to describe and implement software constructs in terms of their responsibilities.[9]\\r\\nTrygve Reenskaug introduced MVC into Smalltalk-76 while visiting the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)[10][11] in the 1970s. In the 1980s, Jim Althoff and others implemented a version of MVC for the Smalltalk-80 class library. Only later did a 1988 article in The Journal of Object Technology (JOT) express MVC as a general concept.[12]\\r\\nThe MVC pattern has subsequently evolved,[13] giving rise to variants such as hierarchical modelÿviewÿcontroller (HMVC), modelÿviewÿadapter (MVA), modelÿviewÿpresenter (MVP), modelÿviewÿviewmodel (MVVM), and others that adapted MVC to different contexts.\\r\\nThe use of the MVC pattern in web applications exploded in popularity after the introduction of NeXT's WebObjects in 1996, which was originally written in Objective-C (that borrowed heavily from Smalltalk) and helped enforce MVC principles. Later, the MVC pattern became popular with Java developers when WebObjects was ported to Java. Later frameworks for Java, such as Spring (released in October 2002), continued the strong bond between Java and MVC. The introduction of the frameworks Django (July 2005, for Python) and Rails (December 2005, for Ruby), both of which had a strong emphasis on rapid deployment, increased MVC's popularity outside the traditional enterprise environment in which it has long been popular. MVC web frameworks now hold large market-shares relative to non-MVC web toolkits.[14]\\r\\nAlthough originally developed for desktop computing, MVC has been widely adopted as an architecture for World Wide Web applications in major programming languages. Several web frameworks have been created that enforce the pattern. These software frameworks vary in their interpretations, mainly in the way that the MVC responsibilities are divided between the client and server.[15]\\r\\nSome web MVC frameworks take a thin client approach that places almost the entire model, view and controller logic on the server. This is reflected in frameworks such as Django, Rails and ASP.NET MVC. In this approach, the client sends either hyperlink requests or form submissions to the controller and then receives a complete and updated web page (or other document) from the view; the model exists entirely on the server.[15] Other frameworks such as AngularJS, EmberJS, JavaScriptMVC and Backbone allow the MVC components to execute partly on the client (also see Ajax).[citation needed]\\r\\nBecause MVC decouples the various components of an application, developers are able to work in parallel on different components without impacting or blocking one another. For example, a team might divide their developers between the front-end and the back-end. The back-end developers can design the structure of the data and how the user interacts with it without requiring the user interface to be completed. Conversely, the front-end developers are able to design and test the layout of the application prior to the data structure being available.\\r\\nBy creating components that are independent of each other, developers are able to reuse components quickly and easily in other applications. The same (or similar) view for one application can be refactored for another application with different data because the view is simply handling how the data is being displayed to the user.","input":"What is the main purpose of mvc architecture?"},{"output":"ronj, palm trees, ber, dhok","context":"Desert National Park, Rajasthan, India, is situated in the west Indian state of Rajasthan near the town of Jaisalmer.

According to other early sources, Pope Clement I was the second pope; according to the Catholic Church's Annuario Pontificio, however, Clement I was the fourth pope. Among those believed by the Catholic Church to have held the position of pope, only Peter, Linus and Clement are specifically mentioned in the New Testament.[1]\\r\\nLinus is mentioned in the closing greeting of the Second Epistle to Timothy as being with Paul in Rome near the end of Paul's life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest witness to Linus's status as bishop was Irenaeus, who in about the year 180 wrote, \\"The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate.\\"[2] The Oxford Dictionary of Popes interprets Irenaeus as classifying Linus as the first bishop of Rome.[3] Linus is presented by Jerome as \\"the first after Peter to be in charge of the Roman Church\\"[4] and by Eusebius as \\"the first to receive the episcopate of the church at Rome, after the martyrdom of Paul and Peter\\".[5] John Chrysostom wrote, \\"This Linus, some say, was second Bishop of the Church of Rome after Peter\\",[6] while the Liberian Catalogue[7] presents Peter as the first Bishop of Rome and Linus as his successor in the same office.\\r\\nThe Liber Pontificalis[8] also presents a list that makes Linus the second in the line of bishops of Rome, after Peter, while also stating that Peter consecrated two bishops, Linus and Anacletus, for the priestly service of the community, devoting himself instead to prayer and preaching, and that it was to Clement that he entrusted the Church as a whole, appointing him as his successor. Tertullian too wrote of Clement as the successor of Peter.[9] Jerome classified Clement as \\"the fourth bishop of Rome after Peter\\" (i.e., fourth in a series that included Peter), adding that, \\"most of the Latins think that Clement was second after the apostle.\\"[10]\\r\\nThe Apostolic Constitutions[11] denote that Linus, who was consecrated by Paul, was the first bishop of Rome and was succeeded by Clement, who was ordained and consecrated by Peter. Cletus is considered Linus's successor by Irenaeus, and the others cited above, who present Linus either as the first bishop of Rome or, if they give Peter as the first, as the second.\\r\\nThe Liberian Catalogue and the Liber Pontificalis date Linus's episcopate to 56ÿ67, during the reign of Nero, but Jerome dates it to 67ÿ78, and Eusebius puts the end of his episcopate at the second year of the reign of Titus (80).\\r\\nLinus is mentioned in the closing greeting of the Second Epistle to Timothy.[12] In that epistle, Linus is noted as being with Paul in Rome near the end of Paul's life. Iren?us stated that this is the same Linus who became Bishop of Rome, a view that is generally still accepted.\\r\\nAccording to the Liber Pontificalis, Linus was an Italian born in Volterra in the Tuscany region. His father's name was recorded as Herculanus. The Apostolic Constitutions name his mother as Claudia (immediately after the name \\"Linus\\" in 2 Timothy 4:21 a Claudia is mentioned, but the Apostolic Constitutions does not explicitly identify that Claudia was Linus's mother). According to Liber Pontificalis, Linus issued a decree that women should cover their heads in church, created the first fifteen bishops, and that he died a martyr and was buried on the Vatican Hill next to Peter. It gives the date of his death as 23 September, the date on which his feast is still celebrated.[13] His name is included in the Roman Canon of the Mass.\\r\\nWith respect to Linus's supposed decree requiring women to cover their heads, J.P. Kirsch commented in the Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Without doubt this decree is apocryphal, and copied by the author of the Liber Pontificalis from the first Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians (11:5) and arbitrarily attributed to the first successor of the Apostle in Rome. The statement made in the same source, that Linus suffered martyrdom, cannot be proved and is improbable. For between Nero and Domitian there is no mention of any persecution of the Roman Church; and Irenaeus (1. c., III, iv, 3) from among the early Roman bishops designates only Telesphorus as a glorious martyr.\\"[1]\\r\\nThe Roman Martyrology does not list Linus as a martyr. The entry about him is as follows: \\"At Rome, commemoration of Saint Linus, Pope, who, according to Irenaeus, was the person to whom the blessed Apostles entrusted the episcopal care of the Church founded in the City, and whom blessed Paul the Apostle mentions as associated with him.\\"[13]\\r\\nA tomb found in St. Peter's Basilica in 1615 by Torrigio was inscribed with the letters LINVS, and was once taken to be Linus's tomb. However a note by Torrigio shows that these were merely the last five letters of a longer name (e.g. Aquilinus or Anullinus).

HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 18% of people within one year of their diagnosis, and in 39% within five years of their diagnosis. Deteriorating liver function is believed to cause changes in the circulation that supplies the intestines, altering blood flow and blood vessel tone in the kidneys. The kidney failure of HRS is a consequence of these changes in blood flow, rather than direct damage to the kidney. The diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome is based on laboratory tests of individuals susceptible to the condition. Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome have been defined: Type 1 HRS entails a rapidly progressive decline in kidney function, while type 2 HRS is associated with ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) that does not improve with standard diuretic medications.\\r\\nThe risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high; the mortality of individuals with type 1 HRS is over 50% over the short term, as determined by historical case series. The only long-term treatment option for the condition is liver transplantation. While awaiting transplantation, people with HRS often receive other treatments that improve the abnormalities in blood vessel tone, including supportive care with medications, or the insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), which is a small shunt placed to reduce blood pressure in the portal vein. Some patients may require hemodialysis to support kidney function, or a newer technique called liver dialysis which uses a dialysis circuit with albumin-bound membranes to bind and remove toxins normally cleared by the liver, providing a means of extracorporeal liver support until transplantation can be performed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHepatorenal syndrome is a particular and common type of kidney failure that affects individuals with liver cirrhosis or, less commonly, with fulminant liver failure.[1] The syndrome involves constriction of the blood vessels of the kidneys and dilation of blood vessels in the splanchnic circulation, which supplies the intestines.[2] The classification of hepatorenal syndrome identifies two categories of kidney failure, termed type 1 and type 2 HRS, which both occur in individuals with either cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. In both categories, the deterioration in kidney function is quantified either by an elevation in creatinine level in the blood, or by decreased clearance of creatinine in the urine.[3]\\r\\nType 1 HRS is characterized by rapidly progressive kidney failure, with a doubling of serum creatinine to a level greater than 221 mol/L (2.5 mg/dL) or a halving of the creatinine clearance to less than 20?mL/min over a period of less than two weeks. The prognosis of individuals with type 1 HRS is particularly grim, with a mortality rate exceeding 50% after one month.[4] Patients with type 1 HRS are usually ill, may have low blood pressure, and may require therapy with drugs to improve the strength of heart muscle contraction (inotropes) or other drugs to maintain blood pressure (vasopressors).[5]\\r\\nIn contrast, type 2 HRS is slower in onset and progression. It is defined by an increase in serum creatinine level to >133 mol/L (1.5?mg/dL) or a creatinine clearance of less than 40?mL/min, and a urine sodium < 10 mol/L.[6] It also carries a poor outlook, with a median survival of approximately six months unless the affected individual undergoes liver transplantation. Type 2 HRS is thought to be part of a spectrum of illness associated with increased pressures in the portal vein circulation, which begins with the development of fluid in the abdomen (ascites). The spectrum continues with diuretic-resistant ascites, where the kidneys are unable to excrete sufficient sodium to clear the fluid even with the use of diuretic medications. Most individuals with type 2 HRS have diuretic-resistant ascites before they develop deterioration in kidney function.[7]\\r\\nBoth types of hepatorenal syndrome share three major components: altered liver function, abnormalities in circulation, and kidney failure. As these phenomena may not necessarily produce symptoms until late in their course, individuals with hepatorenal syndrome are typically diagnosed with the condition on the basis of altered laboratory tests. Most people who develop HRS have cirrhosis, and may have signs and symptoms of the same, which can include jaundice, altered mental status, evidence of decreased nutrition, and the presence of ascites.[2] Specifically, the production of ascites that is resistant to the use of diuretic medications is characteristic of type 2 HRS. Oliguria, which is a decrease in urine volume, may occur as a consequence of kidney failure; however, some individuals with HRS continue to produce a normal amount of urine.[3] As these signs and symptoms may not necessarily occur in HRS, they are not included in the major and minor criteria for making a diagnosis of this condition; instead HRS is diagnosed in an individual at risk for the condition on the basis of the results of laboratory tests, and the exclusion of other causes.[3]\\r\\nHepatorenal syndrome usually affects individuals with cirrhosis and elevated pressures in the portal vein system (termed portal hypertension). While HRS may develop in any type of cirrhosis, it is most common in individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis, particularly if there is concomitant alcoholic hepatitis identifiable on liver biopsies.[8] HRS can also occur in individuals without cirrhosis, but with acute onset of liver failure, termed fulminant liver failure.[3][8]\\r\\nCertain precipitants of HRS have been identified in vulnerable individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. These include bacterial infection, acute alcoholic hepatitis, or bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is the infection of ascites fluid, is the most common precipitant of HRS in cirrhotic individuals. HRS can sometimes be triggered by treatments for complications of liver disease: iatrogenic precipitants of HRS include the aggressive use of diuretic medications or the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid by paracentesis from the abdominal cavity without compensating for fluid losses by intravenous replacement.[8]\\r\\nThere can be many causes of kidney failure in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. Consequently, it is a challenge to distinguish hepatorenal syndrome from other entities that cause kidney failure in the setting of advanced liver disease. As a result, additional major and minor criteria have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome.[3]\\r\\nThe major criteria include liver disease with portal hypertension; kidney failure; the absence of shock, infection, recent treatment with medications that affect the function of the kidney (nephrotoxins), and fluid losses; the absence of sustained improvement in kidney function despite treatment with 1.5 litres of intravenous normal saline; the absence of proteinuria (protein in the urine); and, the absence of kidney disease or obstruction of kidney outflow as seen on ultrasound.[3]\\r\\nThe minor criteria are the following: a low urine volume (less than 500?mL (18?imp?fl?oz; 17?US?fl?oz) per day), low sodium concentration in the urine, a urine osmolality that is greater than that in the blood, the absence of red blood cells in the urine, and a serum sodium concentration of less than 130?mmol/L.[3]\\r\\nMany other diseases of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Individuals with pre-renal kidney failure do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have kidney dysfunction due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys. Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration. In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and increased excretion of sodium.[3] Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure. Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine. As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics.[5] Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of hyaline casts or muddy-brown casts in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material, as the kidneys have not been directly injured.[3] Some viral infections of the liver, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also lead to inflammation of the glomerulus of the kidney.[9][10] Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably, the antibiotic gentamicin) or contrast nephropathy, caused by intravenous administration of contrast agents used for medical imaging tests.[3]\\r\\nThe kidney failure in hepatorenal syndrome is believed to arise from abnormalities in blood vessel tone in the kidneys.[2] The predominant theory (termed the underfill theory) is that blood vessels in the kidney circulation are constricted because of the dilation of blood vessels in the splanchnic circulation (which supplies the intestines), which is mediated by factors released by liver disease.[4][11] Nitric oxide,[12] prostaglandins,[2][13] and other vasoactive substances[2] have been hypothesized as powerful mediators of splanchnic vasodilation in cirrhosis.[2] The consequence of this phenomenon is a decrease in the \\"effective\\" volume of blood sensed by the juxtaglomerular apparatus, leading to the secretion of renin and the activation of the reninÿangiotensin system, which results in the vasoconstriction of vessels systemically and in the kidney specifically.[2] However, the effect of this is insufficient to counteract the mediators of vasodilation in the splanchnic circulation, leading to persistent \\"underfilling\\" of the kidney circulation and worsening kidney vasoconstriction, leading to kidney failure.[11]\\r\\nStudies to quantify this theory have shown that there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure.[14] Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor,[15] prostacyclin, thromboxane A2,[16] and endotoxin.[4] In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin,[15] terlipressin,[17] and octreotide)[18] leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis.\\r\\nThe underfill theory involves activation of the reninÿangiotensinÿaldosterone system, which leads to an increase in absorption of sodium from the kidney tubule (termed renal sodium avidity) mediated by aldosterone, which acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal convoluted tubule.[7][11] This is believed to be a key step in the pathogenesis of ascites in cirrhotics as well. It has been hypothesized that the progression from ascites to hepatorenal syndrome is a spectrum where splanchnic vasodilation defines both resistance to diuretic medications in ascites (which is commonly seen in type 2 HRS) and the onset of kidney vasoconstriction (as described above) leading to hepatorenal syndrome.[7]\\r\\nThe risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high; consequently, there is a significant emphasis on the identification of patients who are at risk for HRS, and prevention of triggers for onset of HRS. As infection (specifically spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis, and are common triggers for HRS, specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications to prevent HRS.[5] Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of ascites and can be preventable. The aggressive use of diuretic medications should be avoided. In addition, many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications (such as some antibiotics) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in kidney function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS.[4][5] Also, large volume paracentesiswhich is the removal of ascites fluid from the abdomen using a needle or catheter in order to relieve discomfortmay cause enough alteration in hemodynamics to precipitate HRS, and should be avoided in individuals at risk. The concomitant infusion of albumin can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large-volume paracentesis and may prevent HRS.[19] Conversely, in individuals with very tense ascites, it has been hypothesized that removal of ascitic fluid may improve kidney function if it decreases the pressure on the renal veins.[20]\\r\\nIndividuals with ascites that have become infected spontaneously (termed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or SBP) are at an especially high risk for the development of HRS.[2] In individuals with SBP, one randomized controlled trial found that the administration of intravenous albumin on the day of admission and on the third day in hospital reduced both the rate of kidney insufficiency and the mortality rate.[21]\\r\\nThe definitive treatment for hepatorenal syndrome is liver transplantation, and all other therapies can best be described as bridges to transplantation.[1][22] While liver transplantation is by far the best available management option for HRS, the mortality of individuals with HRS has been shown to be as high as 25% within the first month after transplantation.[23] Individuals with HRS and evidence of greater hepatic dysfunction (quantified as MELD scores above 36) have been found to be at greatest risk of early mortality after liver transplantation.[23] A further deterioration of kidney function even after liver transplantation in individuals with HRS has been demonstrated in several studies; however, this is transient and thought to be due to the use of medications with toxicity to the kidneys, and specifically the introduction of immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine that are known to worsen kidney function.[2] Over the long-term, however, individuals with HRS who are the recipients of liver transplants almost universally recover kidney function, and studies show that their survival rates at three years are similar to those who have received liver transplants for reasons other than HRS.[1][2]\\r\\nIn anticipation of liver transplantation (which may be associated with considerable in-hospital delay), several other strategies have been found to be beneficial in preserving kidney function. These include the use of intravenous albumin infusion, medications (for which the best evidence is for analogues of vasopressin, which causes splanchnic vasoconstriction), radiological shunts to decrease pressure in the portal vein, dialysis, and a specialized albumin-bound membrane dialysis system termed molecular adsorbents recirculation system (MARS) or liver dialysis.[2]\\r\\nMany major studies showing improvement in kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome have involved expansion of the volume of the plasma with albumin given intravenously.[2][24][25] The quantity of albumin administered intravenously varies: one cited regimen is 1 gram of albumin per kilogram of body weight intravenously on the first day, followed by 20 to 40 grams daily.[26] Notably, studies have shown that treatment with albumin alone is inferior to treatment with other medications in conjunction with albumin; most studies evaluating pre-transplant therapies for HRS involve the use of albumin in conjunction with other medical or procedural treatment.[2][27]\\r\\nMidodrine is an alpha-agonist and octreotide is an analogue of somatostatin, a hormone involved in regulation of blood vessel tone in the gastrointestinal tract. The medications are respectively systemic vasoconstrictors and inhibitors of splanchnic vasodilation, and were not found to be useful when used individually in treatment of hepatorenal syndrome.[1][2][28] However, one study of 13 patients with hepatorenal syndrome showed significant improvement in kidney function when the two were used together (with midodrine given orally, octreotide given subcutaneously and both dosed according to blood pressure), with three patients surviving to discharge.[29] Another nonrandomized, observational study of individuals with HRS treated with subcutaneous octreotide and oral midodrine showed that there was increased survival at 30 days.[1][30]\\r\\nThe vasopressin analogue ornipressin was found in a number of studies to be useful in improvement of kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome,[1][24][31] but has been limited in its use, as it can cause severe ischemia to major organs.[1][24] Terlipressin is a vasopressin analogue that has been found in one large study to be useful for improving kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome with a lesser incidence of ischemia but is not available in the United States.[1][25] A key criticism of all of these medical therapies has been heterogeneity in the populations investigated and the use of kidney function, instead of mortality, as an outcome measure.[32]\\r\\nOther agents that have been investigated for use in treatment of HRS include pentoxifylline,[33] acetylcysteine,[34] and misoprostol.[1][35] The evidence for all of these therapies is based on either case series, or in the case of pentoxifylline, extrapolated from a subset of patients treated for alcoholic hepatitis.[1]\\r\\nA transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) involves the decompression of the high pressures in the portal circulation by placing a small stent between a portal and hepatic vein. This is done through radiologically guided catheters which are passed into the hepatic vein either through the internal jugular vein or the femoral vein. Theoretically, a decrease in portal pressures is thought to reverse the hemodynamic phenomena that ultimately lead to the development of hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS has been shown to improve kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome.[7][36][37] Complications of TIPS for treatment of HRS include the worsening of hepatic encephalopathy (as the procedure involves the forced creation of a porto-systemic shunt, effectively bypassing the ability of the liver to clear toxins), inability to achieve adequate reduction in portal pressure, and bleeding.[7][36]\\r\\nLiver dialysis involves extracorporeal dialysis to remove toxins from the circulation, usually through the addition of a second dialysis circuit that contains an albumin-bound membrane. The molecular adsorbents recirculation system (MARS) has shown some utility as a bridge to transplantation in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, yet the technique is still nascent.[7][38]\\r\\nRenal replacement therapy may be required to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation, although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used.[39] The use of dialysis, however, does not lead to recuperation or preservation of kidney function in patients with HRS, and is essentially only used to avoid complications of kidney failure until transplantation can take place. In patients who undergo hemodialysis, there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to low blood pressure in patients with HRS, although appropriate studies have yet to be performed. As a result, the role of renal replacement therapy in patients with HRS remains unclear.[2]\\r\\nAs the majority of individuals with hepatorenal syndrome have cirrhosis, much of the epidemiological data on HRS comes from the cirrhotic population. The condition is quite common: approximately 10% of individuals admitted to hospital with ascites have HRS.[8] A retrospective case series of cirrhotic patients treated with terlipressin suggested that 20.0% of acute kidney failure in cirrhotics was due to type 1 HRS, and 6.6% was due to type 2 HRS.[17] It is estimated that 18% of individuals with cirrhosis and ascites will develop HRS within one year of their diagnosis with cirrhosis, and 39% of these individuals will develop HRS within five years of diagnosis.[8] Three independent risk factors for the development of HRS in cirrhotics have been identified: liver size, plasma renin activity, and serum sodium concentration.[8]\\r\\nThe prognosis of these patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival.[4][8][22] The severity of liver disease (as evidenced by the MELD score) has been shown to be a determinant of outcome.[23][40] Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis.[33]\\r\\nThe first reports of kidney failure occurring in individuals with chronic liver diseases were from the late 19th century by Frerichs and Flint.[8] However, the hepatorenal syndrome was first defined as acute kidney failure that occurred in the setting of biliary surgery.[1][41] The syndrome was soon re-associated with advanced liver disease,[22] and, in the 1950s, was clinically defined by Sherlock, Hecker, Papper and Vessin as being associated with systemic hemodynamic abnormalities and high mortality.[8][42] Hecker and Sherlock specifically identified that individuals with HRS had low urinary output, very low sodium in the urine, and no protein in the urine.[1] Murray Epstein was the first to characterize splanchnic vasodilation and kidney vasoconstriction as the key alterations in hemodynamics in patients with the syndrome.[43] The functional nature of the kidney impairment in HRS was crystallized by studies demonstrating that kidneys transplanted from patients with hepatorenal syndrome returned to function in the new host,[44] leading to the hypothesis that hepatorenal syndrome was a systemic condition and not a kidney disease. The first systematic attempt to define hepatorenal syndrome was made in 1994 by the International Ascites Club, a group of liver specialists. The more recent history of HRS has involved elucidation of the various vasoactive mediators that cause the splanchnic and kidney blood flow abnormalities of the condition.[8]","input":"Why does liver failure lead to kidney failure?"},{"output":"twelve","context":"","input":"How many countries is there in south america?"},{"output":"S1 Billion","context":"The ownership of Arsenal Football Club is considerably different from that of other clubs in English football.

The company struggled in the club's early years, with its location in industrial Woolwich resulting in low attendances. The club was liquidated and reformed in 1910, and taken over by the owner of Fulham FC, Henry Norris. Norris owned the club for the next nineteen years, moving it to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury in 1913. Norris however was forced to resign as chairman and leave Arsenal in 1929 following an expenses scandal.[8]\\r\\nBy the time of World War II the majority of Arsenal shares were held by Samuel Hill-Wood and Sir Bracewell Smith, the MP for Holborn and a future Lord Mayor of London. In those days the shares were not considered to be valuable and had never paid a dividend, and were seen largely as a charitable exercise to provide recreational entertainment for the working people of North London.[9]\\r\\nAfter his death, the shareholding of Sir Bracewell Smith was divided between his son and daughter and ended up in the hands of his grandchildren, Sir Charles Bracewell-Smith, Clive Carr (Life-President), Richard Carr (still a director) and Sarah Carr, now Lady Phipps-Bagge.[10] Samuel Hill-Wood's shares passed first to his son Denis and then his grandson and former Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood; he sold much of his family's shareholdings in the 1980s to David Dein, who sold some of them on to Danny Fiszman (a London diamond dealer).[11] In the early 2000s the club sold a 9.9% stake to Granada Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of ITV plc,[12] and a significant stake was also bought by hedge fund Lansdowne Partners.[13]\\r\\nAs of 19 May 2017, the largest shareholder in the club is Stan Kroenke, owner of Kroenke Sports Enterprises (KSE), who owns 41,721 shares (67.05%).

This is the largest single stake owned by a non-board member. This led to press speculation of a bidding war between Kroenke and Usmanov.[19] However, Kroenke agreed not to purchase more than 29.9% of the club until at least September 2009,[15] while the rest of the board agreed not to consider a sale of their shares to \\"non-permitted persons\\" until at least April 2009, and had first option on each other's shares until October 2012.[20]\\r\\nIn April 2011, Kroenke extended his ownership of the club by purchasing the shareholdings of Nina Bracewell-Smith (15.9%), Danny Fiszman (16.11%) and other directors of the Arsenal board, taking his shareholding to 66.64%.

An example of a euryhaline fish is the molly (Poecilia sphenops) which can live in fresh water, brackish water, or salt water. The green crab (Carcinus maenas) is an example of a euryhaline invertebrate that can live in salt and brackish water. Euryhaline organisms are commonly found in habitats such as estuaries and tide pools where the salinity changes regularly. However, some organisms are euryhaline because their life cycle involves migration between freshwater and marine environments, as is the case with salmon and eels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opposite of euryhaline organisms are stenohaline ones, which can only survive within a narrow range of salinities. Most freshwater organisms are stenohaline, and will die in seawater, and similarly most marine organisms are stenohaline, and cannot live in fresh water.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsmoregulation is the active process by which an organism maintains its level of water content. The osmotic pressure in the body is homeostatically regulated in such a manner that it keeps the organism's fluids from becoming too diluted or too concentrated. Osmotic pressure is a measure of the tendency of water to move into one solution from another by osmosis.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo major types of osmoregulation are osmoconformers and osmoregulators. Osmoconformers match their body osmolarity to their environment actively or passively. Most marine invertebrates are osmoconformers, although their ionic composition may be different from that of seawater.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsmoregulators tightly regulate their body osmolarity, which always stays constant, and are more common in the animal kingdom. Osmoregulators actively control salt concentrations despite the salt concentrations in the environment. An example is freshwater fish. The gills actively uptake salt from the environment by the use of mitochondria-rich cells. Water will diffuse into the fish, so it excretes a very hypotonic (dilute) urine to expel all the excess water. A marine fish has an internal osmotic concentration lower than that of the surrounding seawater, so it tends to lose water (to the more negative surroundings) and gain salt. It actively excretes salt out from the gills. Most fish are stenohaline, which means they are restricted to either salt or fresh water and cannot survive in water with a different salt concentration than they are adapted to. However, some fish show a tremendous ability to effectively osmoregulate across a broad range of salinities; fish with this ability are known as euryhaline species, e.g., salmon. Salmon has been observed to inhabit two utterly disparate environments  marine and fresh water  and it is inherent to adapt to both by bringing in behavioral and physiological modifications.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome marine fish, like sharks, have adopted a different, efficient mechanism to conserve water, i.e., osmoregulation. They retain urea in their blood in relatively higher concentration. Urea is damaging to living tissue so, to cope with this problem, some fish retain trimethylamine oxide. This provides a better solution to urea's toxicity. Sharks, having slightly higher solute concentration (i.e., above 1000 mOsm which is sea solute concentration), do not drink water like fresh water fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nShort-finned molly\\r\\n\\r\\nRound goby\\r\\n\\r\\nAtlantic stingray\\r\\n\\r\\nBat ray\\r\\n\\r\\nLongnose stingray[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBig-scale sand smelt\\r\\n\\r\\nMoonyfishes\\r\\n\\r\\nPink salmon\\r\\n\\r\\nBarramundi\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen sawfish\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish toothcarp\\r\\n\\r\\nAtlantic threadfin\\r\\n\\r\\nDesert pupfish\\r\\n\\r\\nMayan cichlid\\r\\n\\r\\nCrevalle jacks\\r\\n\\r\\nThe level of salinity in intertidal zones can also be quite variable. Low salinities can be caused by rainwater or river inputs of freshwater. Estuarine species must be especially euryhaline, or able to tolerate a wide range of salinities. High salinities occur in locations with high evaporation rates, such as in salt marshes and high intertidal pools. Shading by plants, especially in the salt marsh, can slow evaporation and thus ameliorate salinity stress. In addition, salt marsh plants tolerate high salinities by several physiological mechanisms, including excreting salt through salt glands and preventing salt uptake into the roots.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite having a regular freshwater presence, the Atlantic stingray is physiologically euryhaline and no population has evolved the specialized osmoregulatory mechanisms found in the river stingrays of the family Potamotrygonidae. This may be due to the relatively recent date of freshwater colonization (under one million years), and/or possibly incomplete genetic isolation of the freshwater populations, as they remain capable of surviving in salt water. Freshwater Atlantic stingrays have only 30-50% the concentration of urea and other osmolytes in their blood compared to marine populations. However, the osmotic pressure between their internal fluids and external environment still causes water to diffuse into their bodies, and they must produce large quantities of dilute urine (at 10 times the rate of marine individuals) to compensate.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nCobia\\r\\n\\r\\nFlathead mullet\\r\\n\\r\\nBull shark\\r\\n\\r\\nthe seagrass Halodule uninervis\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen sea urchin\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite-spotted jellyfish\\r\\n\\r\\nlagoon cockle\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Zealand mud snail\\r\\n\\r\\nAmphipods of the Gammaridae family\\r\\n\\r\\nIrrawaddy dolphin (compared with an average human)\\r\\n\\r\\nAsian shore crab\\r\\n\\r\\nShore crab\\r\\n\\r\\nCrab-eating Frog\\r\\n\\r\\nDiamondback terrapin","input":"What kind of fish live in salt water?"},{"output":"explosive","context":"A cinder cone or scoria cone is a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments, such as either volcanic clinkers, cinders, volcanic ash, or scoria that has been built around a volcanic vent.[1][2] They consist of loose pyroclastic debris formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single, typically cylindrical, vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders, clinkers, or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is symmetrical; with slopes between 30ÿ40; and a nearly circular ground plan. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rock fragments, often called cinders or scoria, are glassy and contain numerous gas bubbles \\"frozen\\" into place as magma exploded into the air and then cooled quickly.[2] Cinder cones range in size from tens to hundreds of meters tall.[2] Cinder cones are made of pyroclastic material. Many cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit. During the waning stage of a cinder-cone eruption, the magma has lost most of its gas content. This gas-depleted magma does not fountain but oozes quietly into the crater or beneath the base of the cone as lava.[3] Lava rarely issues from the top (except as a fountain) because the loose, uncemented cinders are too weak to support the pressure exerted by molten rock as it rises toward the surface through the central vent.[2] Because it contains so few gas bubbles, the molten lava is denser than the bubble-rich cinders.[3] Thus, it often burrows out along the bottom of the cinder cone, lifting the less dense cinders like a cork on water, and advances outward, creating a lava flow around the cone's base.[3] When the eruption ends, a symmetrical cone of cinders sits at the center of a surrounding pad of lava.[3] If the crater is fully breached, the remaining walls form an amphitheatre or horseshoe shape around the vent.\\r\\nCinder cones are commonly found on the flanks of shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes, and calderas.[2] For example, geologists have identified nearly 100 cinder cones on the flanks of Mauna Kea, a shield volcano located on the island of Hawaii.[2] These cones are also referred to as 'scoria cones' and 'cinder and spatter cones.'[2]\\r\\nThe most famous cinder cone, Paricutin, grew out of a corn field in Mexico in 1943 from a new vent.[2] Eruptions continued for nine years, built the cone to a height of 424 meters, and produced lava flows that covered 25?km2.[2]\\r\\nThe Earth's most historically active cinder cone is Cerro Negro in Nicaragua.[2] It is part of a group of four young cinder cones NW of Las Pilas volcano. Since its initial eruption in 1850, it has erupted more than 20 times, most recently in 1995 and 1999.[2]\\r\\nBased on satellite images it was suggested that cinder cones might occur on other terrestrial bodies in the solar system too.[4] They were reported on the flanks of Pavonis Mons in Tharsis,[5][6] in the region of Hydraotes Chaos[7] on the bottom of the Coprates Chasma,[8] or in the volcanic field Ulysses Colles.[9] It is also suggested that domical structures in Marius Hills might represent lunar cinder cones.[10]\\r\\nThe size and shape of cinder cones depend on environmental properties as different gravity and/or atmospheric pressure might change the dispersion of ejected scoria particles.[4] For example, cinder cones on Mars seem to be more than two times wider than terrestrial analogues[9] as lower atmospheric pressure and gravity enable wider dispersion of ejected particles over a larger area.[4][11] Therefore, it seems that erupted amount of material is not sufficient on Mars for the flank slopes to attain the angle of repose and Martian cinder cones seem to be ruled mainly by ballistic distribution and not by material redistribution on flanks as typical on Earth.[11]\\r\\nSome cinder cones are monogenetic ÿ the result of a single, never-to-be-repeated eruption. Parcutin in Mexico, Diamond Head, Koko Head, Punchbowl Crater and some cinder cones on Mauna Kea are monogenetic cinder cones.\\r\\nMonogenetic eruptions can last for more than 10 years.[citation needed] Parcutin erupted from 1943 to 1952.","input":"What type of eruption does cinder cone volcanoes have?"},{"output":"the final trumpet sound and the final woe","context":"In the Book of Revelation, Seven trumpets are sounded, one at a time, to cue apocalyptic events received in the Revelation of Christ Jesus,[1] by John of Patmos.[2][non-primary source needed] The seven trumpets are sounded by seven angels and the events that follow are described in detail from Revelation Chapters 8 to 11. According to Revelation 8:1-2,[3] the angels sound these trumpets after the breaking of the seventh seal. These seals secured the apocalyptic document, that was in the right hand of Him who sits on the main throne.[4] The trumpets are referred to in Koine Greek as ?? (salpingos, salpinx); this was a straight, narrow bronze tube with a mouthpiece of bone and a bell; they do not resemble modern trumpets.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the invention of the brass trumpet, God had Moses make two silver Trumpets (Numbers 10:2), but the traditional sacred horn of the ancient Hebrews was the shofar made from a ram's horn[clarification needed]. It has been used since Moses' day (Exodus 19:13)[5] to get the attention of the Israelites, signal, or to prelude an announcement and/or warning from God. Joshua had 7 priests carry 7 horns for 7 days and circle Jericho 7 times, then the priest sounded the horns, the people shouted and the walls came down. (Joshua 6:4).[5] In St. Paul's letter of I Thessalonians 4:16, \\"the trumpet of God\\" heralds the Second Coming of Christ.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the first trumpet sound, hail and fire, mixed with blood, is thrown to the Earth burning up a third of the trees on the planet, and all green grass. [6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the second trumpet sounding, it cues something like a great burning mountain that plunges into the sea and wipes out a third of all sea life and ships. A third of the oceans will become blood.[7]\\\\\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the sound of the third trumpet, a great star called Wormwood falls to the Earth poisoning a third of the planet's freshwater sources, such as rivers and springs. Men will die from drinking its bitter taste.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the sounding of the fourth trumpet, a third of the light that shines from the Sun, moon and stars became dark from these celestial bodies being \\"struck\\". This catastrophe caused complete darkness for a third of a day, during the day, even through night hours.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth trumpet sound is the \\"first Woe\\" of three. Before this trumpet sounds, an angel (translated eagle in some versions) appears, flying in mid-heaven, and warns, \\"Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth trumpet prompts a personified star to fall from heaven. The star is given the key to the bottomless pit. After opening it, the smoke that rises out, darkens the air and blocks the sunlight. Then from out of the smoke, the Locusts were unleashed. They were scorpion tailed warhorses, having a man's face with lion's teeth. Their hair was long like that of a woman's and flew with locust-like wings. They were crowned with golden crowns and protected with iron-like breastplates. They were commanded by their king, Abaddon, to torment any man who does not have the seal of God on their forehead, by using their scorpion-like tails. It was also made clear to them that they must not kill anyone during their five-month mission of torment.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreterist views\\r\\nRobert Witham, a Catholic commentator, issued his two-volume Annotations on the New Testament, in 1733. Commenting on Chapter 9, he offers two preterist views for identifying the locusts with scorpion tails.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the fifth trumpet blast, the sixth one sounds.[14] This is the \\"Second woe\\", where four angels are released from their binds to the \\"great river Euphrates\\". They command a brute force of 200 million mounted troops whose horses dissipate plague from out of their mouths, most notably: fire, smoke, and brimstone. The mounted horsemen wore breastplates with the color of fire, hyacinth, and brimstone. The horses had a lion's head and their tails were like a serpent, even with a snake head. They are responsible for the deaths of a third of mankind who are stricken by the plague that emanated from these armies.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound of the seventh trumpet signals the \\"Third woe\\". This is the final trumpet sound and the final woe. Loud voices in heaven which said; \\"The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever.\\" Thanks is given to God, the Almighty and praise for the wrath that came, the dead who were judged, and the bond-servants rewarded. \\"Then Gods temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a severe hailstorm.\\" [16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Christian Eschatology, the first six trumpets are used to serve as a wake up call to the sinners on Earth and a call to repentance. Each trumpet blast brings with it a plague of a more disastrous nature than the one before it. The trumpet is used to build anticipation and tells the reader that an alert, announcement, or warning is about to take place. The seventh trumpet does not bring a plague with it. Rather, it is sounded so that glory is given to God and His kingdom is announced.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Preterist understanding is that these blasts are like war trumpets against apostate Israel of the time period and that they correspond to events in the Jewish Wars. For example, the second trumpet is the nation of Rome depicted as a mountain, symbolic for great nations in the Old Testament, and its destruction of Galilee and the Sea of Galilee becoming full of blood and dead bodies.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning the second trumpet blast, Futurist Christian apologists speculate that the \\"great mountain burning with fire\\" that plunges into the sea, in Revelation 8:8,[18] is an impact event by a possible Near-Earth object.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nChristians who follow the Posttribulation rapture doctrine, argue that the seventh trumpet is the last trumpet mentioned in I Corinthians 15:52,[21] and that there is a strong correlation between the events mentioned in Isaiah 27:13,[22] Matthew 24:29-31,[23] and I Thessalonians 4:16.[24] These parallels are used to support the doctrine of the rapture occurring after the tribulation. Therefore, Posttribulationists see the rapture happening during the seventh trumpet.  The nature of the 7th trumpet shows that \\"time is no more, and that the mystery of God is finished, Rev. 10:6,7.  At the 7th trumpet, Jesus rules and reigns forevermore,[25] He has taken His great power and reigned,[26] and He rewards the righteous, and judges the wicked.[27]  Both Jesus and Paul declare that when Jesus comes, His reward is with Him, and He rewards everyone according to their works, Rev. 22:12,2 Tim 4:1.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some scholars who describe a part from the finale from the second symphony by Gustav Mahler, as the seven trumpets, actually played by 4 trumpets, bass drum, cymbals and triangle, which are offstage.[28]","input":"What is the seventh trumpet in the bible?"},{"output":"Hidalgo","context":"The Rio Grande Valley is an area located in the southernmost tip of South Texas. It lies along the northern bank of the Rio Grande river, which separates Mexico from the United States. The four-county region, consisting of Hidalgo, Cameron, Willacy, and Starr counties, is one of the fastest growing places in the United States.[citation needed] From having about 325,000 people in 1969, to today a population over 1,300,000 in 2014. Some of the biggest cities in the region are: Brownsville, Harlingen, Weslaco, Pharr, McAllen, Edinburg, Mission, Hidalgo, and Rio Grande City.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rio Grande Valley is not a true valley, but a floodplain, containing many oxbow lakes or resacas formed from pinched-off meanders in earlier courses of the Rio Grande.[1] Early 20th-century land developers, attempting to capitalize on unclaimed land, utilized the name \\"Magic Valley\\" to attract settlers and appeal to investors. The Rio Grande Valley is also called El Valle, the Spanish translation of \\"the valley\\", by those who live there.[2] The residents of the Rio Grande Valley no longer refer to the area as \\"El Mgico Valle del Ro Grande\\" (\\"The Magical Valley of the Rio Grande\\"), but as \\"The Valley\\" and also simply by the initials R.G.V.\\r\\nThe main region is within four Texan counties: Starr County, Hidalgo County, Willacy County, and Cameron County. As of January 1, 2012, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population of the Rio Grande Valley at 1,305,782.[3] According to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2008, 86 percent of Cameron County, 90 percent of Hidalgo County, 97 percent of Starr County, and 86 percent of Willacy County are Hispanic.[4]\\r\\nThe largest city is Brownsville (Cameron County), followed by McAllen (Hidalgo County). Other major cities include Harlingen, Edinburg, Mission, Rio Grande City, Raymondville, Weslaco, Hidalgo and Pharr.[5]\\r\\nThe Rio Grande Valley experiences a warm and fair climate that brings visitors from many surrounding areas. The east side of the region experiences a humid subtropical climate, and becomes more arid as one heads west. The Valley is one of the southernmost areas of the continental United States, with only a small stretch of southern Florida laying at a lower latitude than the city of Brownsville. Due to its southerly location, the lower Rio Grande Valley tends to be very warm in comparison to northern areas. While having average temperatures that land the region a semi-tropical climate, the lower Valley only misses tropical climate status by a few degrees. Furthermore, the area lays in a transitional climate zone; therefore, cities like Brownsville and South Padre Island land in a tropical savanna climate classification during years when winter months are slightly warmer than average. Due to this, the lower part of region has been known to sustain tropical plants such as flame trees, Cuban Royal palms , and coconut palms.\\r\\nTemperature extremes range from triple digits during the summer months to freezing during the winter. Taking into consideration the regions warm weather, periods of triple digit weather occur much more often than those with freezing temperatures. While the Valley has seen severe cold events before, such as the 2004 Christmas snow storm, the region only occasionally experiences temperatures at or below freezing. These happen less often near the coast, where in some cases, never see temperatures below 35-40 degrees. Artic cold fronts bring colder weather to the region, but tend to dissapate quickly with daytime heating.\\r\\nThe Rio Grande Valleys proximity to the Gulf of Mexico make it a target for hurricanes. Though not impacted as frequently as other areas of the Gulf Coast of the United States, the Valley has experienced major hurricanes in the past. Hurricanes that have made landfall in or near the area include: Hurricane Beulah (1963), Hurricane Allen (1980), Hurricane Gilbert, Hurricane Bret, Hurricane Dolly (2008), and [[Hurricane Alex (2010)]. Having an especially flat terrain, the Valley usually experiences the catastrophic effects of tropical cyclones in the form of flooding. Due to threats of storm surge, the impending impact of tropical cyclones usually results in the closing of the Queen Isabella Causeway and voluntary -or sometimes mandatory- evacuations of the city of South Padre Island and coastal Cameron and Willacy counties.\\r\\nSevere weather in the Rio Grande Valley typically occurs during the spring months. While the area doesnt see intense severe thunderstorm and tornado events like in the northern part of the state of Texas, the south Texas region is not immune to hail and supercell events that result in brief tornado touchdowns.\\r\\nThe Lower Rio Grande Valley encompasses landmarks that attract tourists, and popular destinations include: Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge, and Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park; and on the coast: South Padre Island, Brazos Island, and the Port Isabel Lighthouse.\\r\\nThe Valley is a popular waypoint for tourists visiting northeast Mexico. Popular destinations across the border and Rio Grande include: Matamoros, Nuevo Progreso, Ro Bravo, and Reynosa, all located in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.\\r\\nThe Valley also attracts tourists from the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le܇n, Coahuila, and Mexico, D.F. (Mxico City).\\r\\nThe Valley is historically reliant on agribusiness and tourism. Cotton, grapefruit, sorghum, maize, and sugarcane are its leading crops, and the region is the center of citrus production and the most important area of vegetable production in the State of Texas. Over the last several decades, the emergence of maquiladoras (factories or fabrication plants) has caused a surge of industrial development along the border, while international bridges have allowed Mexican nationals to shop, sell, and do business in the border cities along the Rio Grande. The geographic inclusion of South Padre Island also drives tourism, particularly during the Spring Break season, during which South Padre Island becomes reminiscent of New Orleans during Mardi Gras.[citation needed] During the winter months, many retirees (commonly referred to as \\"Winter Texans\\") arrive to enjoy the warm weather, access to pharmaceuticals and health care in Mexican border crossings such as Nuevo Progreso. There is a substantial health-care industry with major hospitals and many clinics and private practices in Brownsville, Harlingen, and McAllen.\\r\\nTexas is the third largest producer of citrus fruit in United States, the majority of which is grown in the Rio Grande Valley. Grapefruit make up over 70% of the Valley citrus crop, which also includes orange, tangerine, tangelo and Meyer lemon production each Winter.[7]\\r\\nThere are two semi-professional sports teams that play in the Rio Grande Valley: The Rio Grande Valley Vipers (basketball), and The Rio Grande Valley FC Toros (soccer). Previous teams that are now defunct include: the Edinburg Roadrunners (baseball), La Fiera FC (indoor soccer), Rio Grande Valley Ocelots FC,(soccer), Rio Grande Valley WhiteWings (baseball), Rio Grande Valley Killer Bees (ice hockey), and the RGV Sol (indoor football).\\r\\nOne of the Valley's major tourist attractions is the semi-tropical wildlife. Birds and butterflies attract a large amount of visitors every year all throughout the entire valley. Ecotourism is a major economic force in the Rio Grande Valley.\\r\\nAs of 2016, officeholders tend to be Democrat. It is common for voters to be influenced by members of their own extended families and by prominent families in their towns, so politicians often try to make friends with family groups to increase their chances of getting elected. As of 2006, about 20,000 to 30,000 people in Cameron County habitually vote in primary elections, and Presidential elections have higher turnouts. Politiqueras, women hired to help elderly people vote, are crucial in South Texas elections.

It was fought May 12 and 13, 1865, on the banks of the Rio Grande east of Brownsville, Texas and a few miles from the seaport of Los Brazos de Santiago, more than a month after Robert E. Lee had surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant in the Eastern Theater. Though the Battle of Appomattox Court House is identified as the last major battle of the war, Palmito Ranch was the last engagement between organized forces of the Union Army and Confederate States Army involving casualties.\\r\\nUnion and Confederate forces in southern Texas had been observing an unofficial truce, but Union Colonel Theodore H. Barrett ordered an attack on a Confederate camp near Fort Brown for unknown reasons; anecdotes suggest he wanted to see combat before the war ended. The Union attackers captured a few prisoners, but the following day the attack was repulsed near Palmito Ranch by Colonel John Salmon Ford, and the battle became a Confederate victory. Union forces were surprised by Confederate artillery, said to have been supplied by the French Army occupying the nearby Mexican town of Matamoros. Rumors also persist that Confederates were assisted by a steam-powered French gun boat patrolling the Rio Grande.[citation needed]\\r\\nCasualty estimates are not dependable, but Union Private John J. Williams of the 34th Indiana Infantry Regiment is believed to have been the last man killed in combat during the war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter July 27, 1864, the Union Army withdrew most of the 6,500 troops deployed to the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, which they had occupied since November 2, 1863. The Confederates were determined to protect their remaining ports, which were essential for cotton sales to Europe, and the importation of supplies. The Mexicans across the border tended to side with the Confederates because of the lucrative smuggling trade.[1] Beginning in early 1865, the rival armies in south Texas honored a gentlemen's agreement, as they saw no point in further hostilities between them.[2]\\r\\nUnion Major General Lew Wallace proposed a negotiated end of hostilities in Texas to Confederate Brigadier General James E. Slaughter and met with Slaughter and his subordinate Colonel Ford at Port Isabel on March 11ÿ12, 1865.[3] Despite Slaughter's and Ford's agreement that combat would prove tragic, Slaughter's superior, Confederate Maj. Gen. John G. Walker, rejected the ceasefire in a scathing exchange of letters with Wallace. Despite this, both sides honored a tacit agreement not to advance on the other without prior written notice.\\r\\nA brigade of 1,900 Union troops commanded by Col. Robert B. Jones of the 34th Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry were on blockade duty at the Port of Brazos Santiago at the mouth of the present-day ship channel of the Port of Brownsville. The 400-man 34th Indiana was an experienced regiment that had served in the Vicksburg Campaign and was then reorganized in December 1863 as a \\"Veteran\\" regiment composed entirely of veterans from several other regiments whose original enlistments had expired. The 34th Indiana deployed to Los Brazos de Santiago on December 22, 1864, replacing the 91st Illinois Volunteer Infantry, which returned to New Orleans. The brigade also included the 87th and 62nd United States Colored Infantry Regiments (\\"United States Colored Troops\\", or U.S.C.T.) which had a combined strength of about 1,100. Shortly after Gen. Walker rejected the armistice proposal, Col. Jones resigned from the army to return to Indiana. He was replaced in the regiment by Lt. Col. Robert G. Morrison and at Los Brazos de Santiago by Colonel Theodore H. Barrett, commander of the 62nd U.S.C.T.\\r\\nThe 30-year-old Barrett had been an army officer since 1862, but he had yet to see combat. Anxious for higher rank, he volunteered for the newly raised \\"colored\\" regiments and was appointed colonel of the 1st Missouri Colored Infantry in 1863. In March 1864, the regiment became the 62nd U.S.C.T. Barrett contracted malaria in Louisiana that summer, and while he was on convalescent leave, the 62nd was posted to Brazos Santiago. He joined it there in February 1865.\\r\\nWhy this final battle at Palmito Ranch even took place is still debated. Lee had surrendered to Grant in Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, triggering a series of formal surrenders in other places throughout the country. Soon after the battle, Barrett's detractors claimed he desired \\"a little battlefield glory before the war ended altogether.\\"[2] Others have suggested that Barrett needed horses for the 300 dismounted cavalrymen in his brigade and decided to take them from his enemy.[4] Louis J. Schuler, in his 1960 pamphlet The last battle in the War Between the States, May 13, 1865: Confederate Force of 300 defeats 1,700 Federals near Brownsville, Texas, asserts that Brig. Gen. Egbert B. Brown of the U.S. Volunteers had ordered the expedition to seize as contraband 2,000 bales of cotton stored in Brownsville and sell them for his own profit.[5] However, this is impossible as Brown was not appointed to command at Brazos Santiago until later in May.[6]\\r\\nLieutenant Colonel David Branson wanted to attack the Confederate encampments commanded by Ford at White and Palmito Ranches near Fort Brown outside Brownsville. Branson's Union forces consisted of 250 men of the 62nd U.S.C.T. in eight companies and two companies of the (U.S.) 2nd Texas Cavalry Battalion. The 300-man 2nd Texas, like the earlier-formed 1st Texas Cavalry Regiment, was composed largely of Texans of Mexican origin who remained loyal to the United States.[7] They moved from Brazos Santiago to the mainland. At first Branson's expedition was successful, capturing three prisoners and some supplies, although it failed to achieve the desired surprise.[8] During the afternoon, Confederate forces under Captain William N. Robinson counterattacked with less than 100 cavalry, driving Branson back to White's Ranch, where the fighting stopped for the night. Both sides sent for reinforcements; Ford arrived with six French guns and the remainder of his cavalry force (for a total of 300 men), while Barrett came with 200 troops of the 34th Indiana in nine understrength companies.[9][10]\\r\\nThe next day, Barrett started advancing westward, passing a half-mile to the west of Palmito Ranch, with skirmishers from the 34th Indiana deployed in advance.[11] Ford attacked Barrett's force as it was skirmishing with an advance Confederate force along the Rio Grande about 4 p.m. He sent a couple of companies with artillery to attack the Union right flank and the remainder of his force into a frontal attack. After some confusion and fierce fighting, the Union forces retreated towards Boca Chica. Barrett attempted to form a rearguard, but Confederate artillery prevented him from rallying a force sufficient to do so.[12] During the retreat, which lasted until 14 May, 50 members of the 34th Indiana's rearguard company, 30 stragglers, and 20 of the dismounted cavalry were surrounded in a bend of the Rio Grande and captured.[13] The battle is recorded as a Confederate victory.[14]\\r\\nFighting in the battle involved Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, and Native American troops. Reports of shots from the Mexican side, the sounding of a warning to the Confederates of the Union approach, the crossing of Imperial cavalry into Texas, and the participation by several among Ford's troops are unverified, despite many witnesses reporting shooting from the Mexican shore.[11]\\r\\nIn Barrett's official report of August 10, 1865, he reported 115 Union casualties: one killed, nine wounded, and 105 captured.[15] Confederate casualties were reported as five or six wounded, with none killed.[16] Historian and Ford biographer Stephen B. Oates, however, concludes that Union deaths were much higher, probably around 30, many of whom drowned in the Rio Grande or were attacked by French border guards on the Mexican side. He likewise estimated Confederate casualties at approximately the same number.[5][17] Using court-martial testimony and post returns from Brazos Santiago, historian Jerry D. Thompson of Texas A&M International University determined that:\\r\\nPrivate John J. Williams[19] of the 34th Indiana was the last fatality during the Battle at Palmito Ranch, likely making him the final combat death of the entire war, since historians generally agree that this was the final battle.[20][21]\\r\\nConfederate General Edmund Kirby Smith officially surrendered all Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi Department, except those under the command of Brigadier General Chief Stand Watie, on June 2, 1865.[22] Stand Watie, of the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles, became the last Confederate general to surrender his forces on June 23, 1865, in Doaksville, Indian Territory.[23] On that same day, President Andrew Johnson ended the Union blockade of the Southern states.[23]\\r\\nMany senior Confederate commanders in Texas (including Smith, Walker, Slaughter, and Ford) and many troops with their equipment fled across the border to Mexico, possibly to ally with French Imperial forces or with Mexican forces under deposed President Benito Jurez.\\r\\nThe Military Division of the Southwest (after June 27 the Division of the Gulf), commanded by Maj. Gen. Phillip H. Sheridan, occupied Texas between June and August. Consisting of the IV Corps, XIII Corps, the African-American XXV Corps, and two 4,000-man cavalry divisions commanded by Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt and Maj. Gen. George A. Custer, it aggregated a 50,000-man force on the Gulf Coast and along the Rio Grande to pressure the French intervention in Mexico and garrison the Reconstruction Department of Texas.\\r\\nIn July 1865, Barrett preferred charges of disobedience of orders, neglect of duty, abandoning his colors, and conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline against Morrison for actions in the battle, resulting in the latter's court martial. Confederate Col. Ford, who had returned from Mexico at the request of Union Gen. Frederick Steele to act as parole commissioner for disbanding Confederate forces, appeared as a defense witness and assisted in absolving Morrison of responsibility for the defeat.[5]\\r\\nThe history of the battle is also significant for providing accounts of the roles of Hispanic Confederate veterans and of the treatment of black prisoners-of-war in South Texas. There were Hispanic Confederate veterans at Fort Brown in Brownsville and on the field of Palmito Ranch. Col. Santos Benavides, who was the highest ranking Hispanic in either army, led between 100 and 150 Hispanic soldiers in the Brownsville Campaign in May 1865.[24]\\r\\nSome of the Sixty-Second Colored Regiment were also taken. They had been led to believe that if captured they would either be shot or returned to slavery. They were agreeably surprised when they were paroled and permitted to depart with the white prisoners. Several of the prisoners were from Austin and vicinity. They were assured they would be treated as prisoners of war. There was no disposition to visit upon them a mean spirit of revenge.[25]\\r\\nWhen Colonel Ford surrendered his command following the campaign of Palmito Ranch he urged his men to honor their paroles. He insisted that \\"The negro had a right to vote.\\"[25]\\r\\nAlthough officially this is considered by most historians to be the last ever land engagement fought between the north and the south. Several sources suggest that the battle of Hobdy's Bridge located near Eufaula in Alabama was the last skirmish between the two forces, on 19 of May, 1865. Union records show that in fact the last northern soldier killed in combat during the war was a man by the name of John W. Skinner who was ranked corporal at the time of his death. Three others were wounded and one unharmed, all from the same unit, Company C, 1st Florida U.S. Cavalry.[1]\\r\\nResulting in a Confederate victory, however as there was no organised command structure, but rather rebel stragglers there was controversy surrounding the validity of the union men. In 1896 these same men had their pensions cut though this was quickly rectified by an appeal to the commissioner of pensions. The assistant secretary to the commissioner then overturned this decision thus legally ruling them as the last union casualties of the war.[2]\\r\\nOn April 2, 1866, President Johnson declared the insurrection at an end, except in Texas, because of a technicality concerning incomplete formation of a new state government.[23] He declared the insurrection at an end in Texas and throughout the United States on August 20, 1866.[23]\\r\\nToday, the Palmito Ranch Battlefield preserves the location of the last battle of the American Civil War. The area has remained relatively unchanged, with the marshy, windswept prairies almost the same as they were in 1865. Over 5,400 acres (2,200?ha) are protected at the site, which is included in the National Register of Historic Places. The only indication that anything happened here, however, is a marker on the \\"Boca Chica Highway\\" (Texas State Highway 4) near where Palmito Ranch originally stood.\\r\\n{reflist}\\r\\nCoordinates: 255648N 971707W? / ?25.94667N 97.28528W? / 25.94667; -97.28528","input":"Where was the last civil war battle fought?"},{"output":"October 1, 1949","context":"The history of the People's Republic of China details the history of mainland China since October 1, 1949, when, after a near complete victory by the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the Chinese Civil War, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China (PRC) from atop Tiananmen.  The PRC has for several decades been synonymous with China, but it is only the most recent political entity to govern mainland China, preceded by the Republic of China (ROC) and thousands of years of imperial dynasties.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the Chinese Civil War and the victory of Mao Zedong's Communist forces over the Kuomintang forces of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to Taiwan, Mao declared the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. Mao's first goal was a total overhaul of the land ownership system, and extensive land reforms. China's old system of gentry landlord ownership of farmland and tenant peasants was replaced with a distribution system in favor of poor/landless peasants which significantly reduced economic inequality. Over a million landlords were executed.[1] In Zhangzhuangcun, in the more thoroughly reformed north of the country, most \\"landlords\\" and \\"rich peasants\\" had lost all their land and often their lives or had fled. All formerly landless workers had received land, which eliminated this category altogether. As a result, \\"middling peasants,\\" who now accounted for 90 percent of the village population, owned 90.8 percent of the land.[2] Mao laid heavy theoretical emphasis on class struggle, and in 1953 began various campaigns to persecute former landlords and merchants, including the execution of more powerful landlords. Drug trafficking in the country as well as foreign investment were largely wiped out.\\r\\n\\r\\nMao believed that socialism would eventually triumph over all other ideologies, and following the First Five-Year Plan based on a Soviet-style centrally controlled economy, Mao took on the ambitious project of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, beginning an unprecedented process of collectivization in rural areas. Mao urged the use of communally organized iron smelters to increase steel production, pulling workers off of agricultural labor to the point that large amounts of crops rotted unharvested. Mao decided to continue to advocate these smelters despite a visit to a factory steel mill which proved to him that high quality steel could only be produced in a factory. He thought that ending the program would dampen peasant enthusiasm for his political mobilization, the Great Leap Forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe implementation of Maoist thought in China may have been responsible for over 40ÿ70 million deaths including famine during peacetime[3], with the Great Leap Forward,  Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957ÿ1958,[4] and the Cultural Revolution. Millions died from both executions and forced labour.\\r\\nBecause of Mao's land reforms during the Great Leap Forward, which resulted in massive famines, thirty million perished between 1958 and 1961.  By the end of 1961 the birth rate was nearly cut in half because of malnutrition.[5] Active campaigns, including party purges and \\"reeducation\\" resulted in the imprisonment or execution of those deemed to hold views contrary to Maoist ideals.[6]\\r\\nMao's failure with the Leap reduced his power in government, whose administrative duties fell to Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo impose socialist orthodoxy and rid China of \\"old elements\\", and at the same time serving certain political goals, Mao began the Cultural Revolution in May 1966. The campaign was far reaching into all aspects of Chinese life. Red Guards terrorized the streets as many ordinary citizens were deemed counter-revolutionaries. Education and public transportation came to a nearly complete halt. Daily life involved shouting slogans and reciting Mao quotations. Many prominent political leaders, including Liu and Deng, were purged and deemed \\"capitalist-roaders\\". The campaign would not come to a complete end until the death of Mao in 1976.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporters of the Maoist Era claim that under Mao, China's unity and sovereignty was assured for the first time in a century, and there was development of infrastructure, industry, healthcare, education (only 20% of the population could read in 1949, compared to 65.5% thirty years later)[7], which raised standard of living for the average Chinese. They also claimed that campaigns such as the Great Leap Forward ÿ an example of the concept New Democracy ÿ and the Cultural Revolution were essential in jumpstarting China's development and \\"purifying\\" its culture. Others[8] claim that though the consequences of both these campaigns were economically and humanly disastrous, they left behind a \\"clean slate\\" on which later economic progress could be built. Supporters often also doubt statistics or accounts given for death tolls or other damages incurred by Mao's campaigns, attributing the high death toll to natural disasters, famine, or other consequences of political chaos during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek.\\r\\n\\r\\nMao Zedong's death was followed by a power struggle between the Gang of Four, Hua Guofeng, and eventually Deng Xiaoping. Deng would maneuver himself to the top of China's leadership by 1980. At the Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee, Deng embarked China on the road to Economic Reforms and Openness (T˜ Gaige Kaifang), policies that began with the de-collectivization of the countryside, followed with industrial reforms aimed at decentralizing government controls in the industrial sector. A major document presented at the September 1979 Fourth Plenum, gave a \\"preliminary assessment\\" of the entire 30-year period of Communist rule. At the plenum, party Vice Chairman Ye Jianying declared the Cultural Revolution \\"an appalling catastrophe\\" and \\"the most severe setback to [the] socialist cause since [1949].\\"[9] The Chinese government's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This stated that \\"Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the \\"cultural revolution\\", but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the subject of Mao's legacy Deng coined the famous phrase \\"7 parts good, 3 parts bad\\" and avoided denouncing Mao altogether. Deng championed the idea of Special Economic Zones (SEZs), areas where foreign investment would be allowed to pour in without strict government restraint and regulations, running on a basically capitalist system. Deng laid emphasis on light industry as a stepping stone to the development of heavy industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporters of the economic reforms point to the rapid development of the consumer and export sectors of the economy, the creation of an urban middle class that now constitutes 15% of the population, higher living standards (which is shown via dramatic increases in GDP per capita, consumer spending, life expectancy, literacy rate, and total grain output) and a much wider range of personal rights and freedoms for average Chinese as evidence of the success of the reforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough standards of living improved significantly in the 1980s, Deng's reforms were not without criticism. Hard-liners asserted that Deng opened China once again to various social evils, and an overall increase in materialistic thinking, while liberals attacked Deng's unrelenting stance on political reform. Liberal forces began gathering in different forms to protest against the Party's authoritarian leadership. In 1989, the death of Hu Yaobang, a liberal figure, triggered weeks of spontaneous protests in the Tiananmen Square. The government imposed martial law and sent in tanks and soldiers to suppress the demonstrations. Western countries and multilateral organizations briefly suspended their formal ties with China's government under Premier Li Peng's leadership, which was directly responsible for the military curfew and bloody crackdown.\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics of the economic reforms, both in China and abroad, claim that the reforms have caused wealth disparity, environmental pollution, rampant corruption, widespread unemployment associated with layoffs at inefficient state-owned enterprises, and has introduced often unwelcome cultural influences. Consequently, they believe that China's culture has been corrupted, the poor have been reduced to a hopeless abject underclass, and that the social stability is threatened. They are also of the opinion that various political reforms, such as moves towards popular elections, have been unfairly nipped in the bud.  Regardless of either view, today, the public perception of Mao has improved at least superficially; images of Mao and Mao related objects have become fashionable, commonly used on novelty items and even as talismans. However, the path of modernization and market-oriented economic reforms that China started since the early 1980s appears to be fundamentally unchallenged. Even critics of China's market reforms do not wish to see a backtrack of these two decades of reforms, but rather propose corrective measures to offset some of the social issues caused by existing reforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1979, the Chinese government instituted a one child policy to try to control its rapidly increasing population.  The controversial policy resulted in a dramatic decrease in child poverty. The law currently applies to about a third of mainland Chinese, with plans in place to ease it to a two-child limit.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe achievements of Lee Kuan Yew to create an economic superpower in Singapore had a profound effect on the Communist leadership in China. They made a major effort, especially under Deng Xiaoping, to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship, and subtle suppression of dissent. Over 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the events at Tiananmen, Deng Xiaoping retired from public view. While keeping ultimate control, power was passed onto the third generation of leadership led by Jiang Zemin, who was hailed as its \\"core\\". Economic growth, despite foreign trade embargoes, returned to a fast pace by the mid-1990s. Jiang's macroeconomic reforms furthered Deng's vision for \\"Socialism with Chinese Characteristics\\". At the same time, Jiang's period saw a continued rise in social corruption in all areas of life.  Unemployment skyrocketed as unprofitable SOE's were closed to make way for more competitive ventures, internally and abroad. The ill-equipped social welfare system was put on a serious test. Jiang also laid heavy emphasis on scientific and technological advancement in areas such as space exploration. To sustain vast human consumption, the Three Gorges Dam was built, attracting supporters and widespread criticism. Environmental pollution became a very serious problem as Beijing was frequently hit by sandstorms as a result of desertification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1990s saw two foreign colonies returned to China, Hong Kong from Britain in 1997, and Macau from Portugal in 1999. Hong Kong and Macau mostly continued their own governance, retaining independence in their economic, social, and judicial systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nJiang and President Clinton exchanged state visits, but Sino-American relations took very sour turns at the end of the decade. On May 7, 1999, during the Kosovo War, US aircraft bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. The U.S. government claimed the strike was due to bad intelligence and false target identification.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the US, the Cox Report stated that China had been stealing various top US military secrets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, a US surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet over international waters near Hainan, inciting further outrage with the Chinese public, already dissatisfied with the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the political agenda, China was once again put on the spotlight for the banning of public Falun Gong activity in 1999. Silent protesters from the spiritual movement sat outside of Zhongnanhai, asking for dialogue with China's leaders. Jiang saw it as threatening to the political situation and outlawed the group altogether, while using the mass media to denounce it as an evil cult.\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, Premier Zhu Rongji's economic policies held China's economy strong during the Asian Financial Crisis. Economic growth averaged at 8% annually, pushed back by the 1998 Yangtze River Floods. After a decade of talks, China was finally admitted into the World Trade Organization.  Standards of living improved significantly, although a wide urban-rural wealth gap was opened, as China saw the reappearance of the middle class. Wealth disparity between East and the Western hinterlands continued to widen by the day, prompting government programs to \\"develop the West\\", taking on such ambitious projects such as the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The burden of education was greater than ever.  Rampant corruption continued despite Premier Zhu's anti-corruption campaign that executed many officials.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first major issue faced by China in the 21st century as a new generation of leaders led by Hu Jintao after assuming power was the public health crisis involving SARS, an illness that seemed to have originated out of Guangdong province. China's position in the war on terror drew the country closer diplomatically to the United States. The economy continues to grow in double-digit numbers as the development of rural areas became the major focus of government policy. In gradual steps to consolidate his power, Hu Jintao removed Shanghai Party Chief Chen Liangyu and other potential political opponents amidst the fight against corruption, and the ongoing struggle against once powerful Shanghai clique. The assertion of the Scientific Perspective to create a Socialist Harmonious Society is the focus of the Hu-Wen administration, as some Jiang-era excesses are slowly reversed. In the years after Hu's rise to power, respect of basic human rights in China continue to be a source of concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe political status and future of Taiwan remain uncertain, but steps have been taken to improving relations between the Communist Party and several of Taiwan's parties that hold a less antagonistic view towards China, notably former rival Kuomintang.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe continued economic growth of the country as well as its sporting power status gained China the right to host the 2008 Summer Olympics. However, this also put Hu's administration under intense spotlight.  While the 2008 Olympic was commonly understood to be a come-out party for People's Republic of China, in light of the March 2008 Tibet protests, the government received heavy scrutiny. The Olympic torch was met with protest en route. Within the country these reactions were met with a fervent wave of nationalism with accusations of Western bias against China.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2008, a massive earthquake registering 8.0 on the Richter scale hit Sichuan province of China, exacting a death toll officially estimated at approximately 70,000.  The government responded more quickly than it did with previous events, and has allowed foreign media access to the regions that were hit the hardest.  The adequacy of the government response was generally praised, and the relief efforts extended to every corner of Chinese life.\\r\\nIn May and June 2008, heavy rains in southern China caused severe flooding in the provinces of Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong, with dozens of fatalities and over a million people forced to evacuate. As of 2009 China has increased its internet monitoring capabilities by adding hundreds of new monitoring stations.","input":"When was the people's republic of china founded?"},{"output":"September 1996","context":"This is a timeline of the background of the Taliban's rise to power.\\r\\nIt details the Taliban movement's origins in Pashtun nationalism, and briefly relates its ideological underpinnings with that of broader Afghan society.\\r\\nIt details the Taliban's consolidation of power, listing persecutions by the Taliban officials during its five years in power in Afghanistan and during its war with the Northern Alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the power vacuum created by the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the country was torn apart by warring mujahideen groups and the ISI of Pakistan grasped the chance to wield power in the region by fostering a previously unknown Kandahari student movement.[1] They continued to support the Taliban, as Pakistani allies, in their push to conquer Afghanistan in the 1990s.[2]\\r\\nTaliban initially enjoyed enormous good will from Afghans weary of the corruption, brutality, and the incessant fighting of Mujahideen warlords.[3] One story is that the rape and murder of boys and girls from a family traveling to Kandahar or a similar outrage by Mujahideen bandits sparked Mohammed Omar (Mullah Omar) and his students to vow to rid Afghanistan of these criminals.[4] Another motivation was that the Pakistan-based truck shipping mafia known as the \\"Afghanistan Transit Trade\\" and their allies in the Pakistan government, trained, armed, and financed the Taliban to clear the southern road across Afghanistan to the Central Asian Republics of extortionate bandit gangs.[5]\\r\\nMany senior leaders of the Afghanistan Taliban were closely associated with and had attended the Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary in Akora Khattak in Pakistan, including Mullah Omar, and its role in supporting the Taliban.[6][7] The seminary is run by Maulana Sami ul Haq of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam who is often referred to as the \\"Father of the Taliban\\".[6][8]\\r\\nAfter the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979, Islamic mujahideen fighters engaged in war with those soviet forces. Some of those Islamic fighters would later transform into the Taliban according to Professor Carole Hillenbrand who stated: \\"The West helped the Taliban to fight the Soviet takeover of Afghanistan\\".[9]\\r\\nAlthough there isn't any evidence that the CIA directly supported the Taliban or Al Qaeda, some basis for military support of the Taliban was provided when, in the early 1980s, the CIA and the ISI (Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency) provided arms to Afghans resisting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the ISI assisted the process of gathering radical Muslims from around the world to fight against the Soviets.[10] Osama Bin Laden was one of the key players in organizing training camps for the foreign Arab volunteers, although his organization, Maktab al-Khidamat, was exclusively Saudi funded.[11] [12]\\r\\nThe Taliban were based in the Helmand, Kandahar, and Uruzgan regions and were overwhelmingly ethnic Pashtuns and predominantly Durrani Pashtuns.[13]\\r\\nThe first major military activity of the Taliban was in OctoberÿNovember 1994 when they marched from Maiwand in southern Afghanistan to capture Kandahar City and the surrounding provinces, losing only a few dozen men.[14] Starting with the capture of a border crossing and a huge ammunition dump from warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a few weeks later they freed \\"a convoy trying to open a trade route from Pakistan to Central Asia\\" from another group of warlords attempting to extort money.[15] In the next three months this hitherto \\"unknown force\\" took control of twelve of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, with Mujahideen warlords often surrendering to them without a fight and the \\"heavily armed population\\" giving up their weapons.[16] By September 1996 they had captured Afghanistan's capital, Kabul.\\r\\nUnder the Taliban regime, Sharia law was interpreted to ban a wide variety of activities hitherto lawful in Afghanistan: employment, education and sports for women, movies, television, videos, music, dancing, hanging pictures in homes, clapping during sports events, kite flying, and beard trimming. One Taliban list of prohibitions included:\\r\\npork, pig, pig oil, anything made from human hair, satellite dishes, cinematography, and equipment that produces the joy of music, pool tables, chess, masks, alcohol, tapes, computers, VCRs, television, anything that propagates sex and is full of music, wine, lobster, nail polish, firecrackers, statues, sewing catalogs, pictures, Christmas cards.[17]\\r\\nMen were required to have a beard extending farther than a fist clamped at the base of the chin. On the other hand, they had to wear their head hair short. Men were also required to wear a head covering.[18]\\r\\nPossession was forbidden of depictions of living things, whether drawings, paintings or photographs, stuffed animals, and dolls.[18]\\r\\nThese rules were issued by the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Suppression of Vice (PVSV) and enforced by its \\"religious police,\\" a concept thought to be borrowed from the Wahhabis. In newly conquered towns hundreds of religious police beat offenders (typically men without beards and women who were not wearing their burqas properly) with long sticks.[19]\\r\\nTheft was punished by the amputation of a hand, rape and murder by public execution. Married adulterers were stoned to death. In Kabul, punishments were carried out in front of crowds in the city's former soccer stadium.\\r\\nWomen in particular were targets of the Taliban's restrictions. They were prohibited from working; from wearing clothing regarded as \\"stimulating and attractive,\\" including the \\"Iranian chador,\\" (viewed as insufficiently complete in its covering); from taking a taxi without a \\"close male relative\\" (mahram); washing clothes in streams; or having their measurements taken by tailors.[20]\\r\\nEmployment of women was restricted to the medical sector because male medical personnel were not allowed to examine women. One result of the Taliban's ban on employment of women was the closing down of many primary schools, in places such as Kabul, not only for girls but for boys too, because almost all the teachers there were women.[21]\\r\\nWomen were also not permitted to attend co-educational schools; in practice, this prevented the vast majority of young women and girls in Afghanistan from receiving even a primary education.[22][23]\\r\\nWomen were made to wear the burqa, a traditional dress covering the entire body, with a small screen covering the face through which the wearer could see. Taliban restrictions became more severe after they took control of the capital. In February 1998, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul and issued new regulations ordering \\"householders to blacken their windows, so women would not be visible from the outside.\\"[24] Home schools for girls, which had been allowed to continue, were forbidden.[25] In June 1998, the Taliban stopped all women from attending general hospitals,[26] leaving the use of one all-women hospital in Kabul. There were many reports of Muslim women being beaten by the Taliban for violating the Taliban interpretation of the Sharia.\\r\\nMovie theaters were closed and music was banned. Hundreds of cultural artifacts that were deemed polytheistic were also destroyed including a major museum and countless private art collections. [27]\\r\\nA sample Taliban edict issued after their capture of Kabul is one decreed in December 1996 by the \\"General Presidency of Amr Bil Maruf and Nahi Anil Munkar\\" (or Religious Police) banning a variety of things and activities: music, shaving of beards, keeping of pigeons, flying kites, displaying of pictures or portraits, western hairstyles, music and dancing at weddings, gambling, \\"sorcery,\\" and not praying at prayer times.[20] In February 2001, Taliban used sledgehammers to destroy representational works of art at the National Museum of Afghanistan.[28]\\r\\nLocal festivities were not exempt from prohibitions. The Taliban banned the traditional Afghan New Year's celebrations and \\"for a time they also banned [Ashura] the Shia Islamic month of mourning and even restricted any show of festivity at Eid.\\"[29] The Afghan people were not allowed to have any cultural celebrations if women were present. If there were only men at the celebration it would be allowed, so long as it ended by 7:00 p.m, a set time.\\r\\nMany Taliban officials wanted to give entertain or said they did but they wanted it to be set by them and guided by the holy religion.\\r\\nIn March 2001, the Taliban ordered the demolition of two statues of Buddhas carved into cliffsides at Bamiyan, one 38 metres (125?ft) tall and carved in 507 CE, the other 53 metres (174?ft) tall and carved in 554 CE. The act was condemned by UNESCO and many countries around the world.\\r\\nThe intentions of the destruction remain unclear. Mullah Omar initially supported the preservation of Afghanistan's heritage, and Japan linked financial aid to the preservation of the statues.[30] However, after a few years, a decree was issued claiming all representations of humans and idols, including those in museums, must be destroyed in accordance with Islamic law which prohibits any form of idol worship.\\r\\nThe government of Pakistan (itself host to one of the richest and most ancient collections of Buddhist art) implored the Taliban to spare the statues. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates later denounced the act as savage.\\r\\nSayed Rahmatullah Hashemi, a senior representative of the Taliban designated as the roving Ambassador, visited the US in March, 2001. He portrayed the Taliban's action not as an act of irrationality, but as an act of rage over UNESCO and some western governments denying the Taliban use of the funds meant for the repairs of the war-damaged statues of the Buddha. He contended that the Taliban intended to use the money for drought relief.[31] However, the Taliban spent much money and effort on destroying the statues, resources which they could have instead used for drought relief.\\r\\nThe worst attack on civilians came in summer of 1998 when the Taliban swept north from Herat to the predominantly Hazara and Uzbek city of Mazar-i-Sharif, the largest city in the north. Entering at 10 am on 8 August 1998, for the next two days the Taliban drove their pickup trucks \\"up and down the narrow streets of Mazar-i-Sharif shooting to the left and right and killing everything that moved  shop owners, cart pullers, women and children shoppers and even goats and donkeys.\\"[32] More than 8000 noncombatants were reported killed in Mazar-i-Sharif and later in Bamiyan.[33] Contrary to the injunctions of Islam, which demands immediate burial, the Taliban forbade anyone to bury the corpses for the first six days while they rotted in the summer heat and were eaten by dogs.[34] In addition to this indiscriminate slaughter, the Taliban sought out and massacred members of the Hazara, a mostly Shia ethnic group, while in control of Mazar-i-Sharif.\\r\\nWhile the slaughter can be attributed to several factors ÿ ethnic difference, suspicion of Hazara loyalty to their co-religionists in Iran, fury at the loss of life suffered in an earlier unsuccessful Taliban takeover of Mazar ÿ the belief by some Sunni Taliban that the Shia Hazaras were guilty of takfir (apostasy) may have been the principal motivation. It was expressed by Mullah Niazi, the commander of the attack and governor of Mazar after the attack, in his declaration from Mazar's central mosque:\\r\\n\\"Last year you rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you shot at us. Now we are here to deal with you. The Hazaras are not Muslims and now we have to kill Hazaras. You either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. Wherever you go we will catch you. If you go up we will pull you down by your feet; if you hide below, we will pull you up by your hair.\\"[35]\\r\\nHazara also suffered a siege by the Taliban of their Hazarajat homeland in central Afghanistan and the refusal by the Taliban to allow the UN to supply food to Hazara in the provinces of Bamiyan, Ghor, Wardak and Ghazni.[36] A month after the Mazar slaughter, Taliban broke through Hazar lines and took over Hazarajat. The number of civilians killed was not as great as in Mazar, but occurred nevertheless.[37]\\r\\nDuring the years that followed, massacres of Hazara by Taliban forces were documented by groups such as Human Rights Watch.[38]\\r\\nAccording to the testimony of Guantanamo captives before their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its civil service.[citation needed]","input":"When did the taliban first take over afghanistan?"},{"output":"Arshad Warsi","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBigg Boss is an Indian reality television game show franchise produced by EndemolShine India through Viacom 18 and Colors, broadcast in India, subsequently syndicated internationally and made available online as VOD through OTT platforms.

The franchise has extended its presence in Kannada, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Malayalam as of 2018. Though only celebrities were selected to be the housemates in the initial seasons, general public have been auditioned to be on the show in the latest seasons of Hindi, Kannada[1] and Telugu[2] versions of the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the show, contestants called \\"housemates\\" live together in a specially-constructed house that is isolated from the outside world. Housemates are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize. During their stay in the house, contestants are continuously monitored by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program relies on techniques such as a stripped back-to-basic environment, evictions, weekly tasks and competitions set by Bigg Boss, and the \\"Confession Room\\" where housemates convey their private thoughts to the camera and reveal their nominees for eviction. At regular intervals, the housemates privately nominate a number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to vote (via SMS or online through social media and smartphone applications) for the nominee they wish to be evicted or to be saved from eviction. The last person remaining is declared the winner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contestants are required to indulge in housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as \\"Bigg Boss\\"). The tasks are designed to test the teamwork abilities and community spirit of the housemates. The housemates' \\"luxury budget\\" (weekly allowance to buy luxury food items other than the supplied essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBigg Boss is a Hindi (Bollywood) adaption of Big Brother created in Netherlands by John de Mol Jr., largely based on the Celebrity Big Brother model owned by the Endemol Shine Group. The show was named Bigg Boss and a house was constructed for the purpose of the show at Lonavla in Maharashtra. Bigg Boss debuted on television in 2006 through Sony Entertainment Television with Arshad Warsi as the host.

It is dated variously from the late 4th century[1] to the 8th century.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChanakya and Chandragupta defeat the king Nanda, in an alliance with another king Parvateshvara (or Parvata).\\r\\nParvata and Chandragupta plan to divide up the old possessions of the Nanda Empire. Next, Parvata dies poisoned by a Visha Kanya and his son Malayaketu succeeds him. Malayaketu, together with Rakshasa, the last minister of Nanda, demands the inheritance of all the old territories of the Nanda. Rakshasa, has also vowed to avenge the murder of his master Nanda and kill Chandragupta for that crime. He plans an attack on his capital with the help of Malayaketu.\\r\\nThe challenge before Chanakya is to somehow bring Rakshasa to accept the office of the Prime minister of Chandragupta. He cannot do it by force for the fear of harming Rakshasa. No inducement can work either. So he employs the strategy of isolating Rakshasa from his allies. This he does by fabricating evidence to show that Rakshasa is willing to sacrifice Malayaketu and join Chandragupta's camp. Malayaketu falls for this deceit and debunks Rakshasa. The second part of Chanakya's strategy is to force Rakshasa to surrender and accept Chandragupta's ministership. This he achieves by announcing death penalty for Chandanadasa, an old friend of Rakshasa. Circumstances bring Rakshasa to the city of Pataliputra where his friend is about to be put to the gallows. Rakshasa obtains his release by surrendering himself and agreeing to become the Prime minister to Chandragupta.\\r\\nThe title of the play is explained as 'the play in which Rakshasa is caught with the help of a ring.' Rakshasa's official signet ring plays a very significant role in Chanakya's overall strategy to discredit Rakshasa in Malayaketu's eyes. A chance discovery of Rakshsa's official ring by Chanakya's spy helps Chanakya to prepare and authenticate a fake letter purportedly addressed by Rakshasa to Chandragupta. His seal then seals his fate.\\r\\nThe historical basis of the Mudrarakshasa is somewhat supported by the description of this period of history in Classical Hellenistic sources: the violent rule of the Nanda, the usurpation of Chandragupta, the formation of the Maurya Empire.\\r\\nAccording to the Sanskrit play Mudrarakshasa, Malayaketu was the king of a kingdom in Punjab located between the Jhelum and the Chenab (Greek: the Hydaspes and the Acesines) and dominions extending to Hyphasis.[3][not in citation given] Mudrarakshasa states that army of Malayaketu included people from Khasas, Magadha, Gandhara, Yavana, Saka, Chedi and Huna.[4]\\r\\nDhundiraja, the author of Jataka Bharanam, had written a commentary on Mudrarakshasa.\\r\\nThere is a Tamil version based on the Sanskrit play[5] and Keshavlal Dhruv translated the original into Gujarati as Mel ni Mudrika (1889).\\r\\nThe later episodes of the TV series Chanakya were based mostly on the Mudrarakshasa. A film in Sanskrit was made in 2006 by Manish K. Mokshagundam, using the same plot as the play but in a modern setting.[6]","input":"Who was the author of the book entitled mudrarakshasa?"},{"output":"March 6, 2011","context":"Love & Hip Hop: New York (originally known as simply Love & Hip Hop) is the original installment of the Love & Hip Hop reality television franchise on VH1.

The show features appearances from notable figures associated with East Coast hip hop. Its success has produced the spin-offs Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta, Chrissy & Mr. Jones, Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood, K. Michelle: My Life, Stevie J & Joseline: Go Hollywood, Leave It To Stevie and Love & Hip Hop: Miami.\\r\\nOn October 2, 2017, VH1 announced the show's return for an eighth season, which premiered on October 30, 2017.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, rapper Jim Jones approached VH1 executives to make a reality show about him.[2] Jim Ackerman, senior vice president of development and production at the time, was intrigued by the idea[3] and paired him with producers Stefan Springman and Toby Barraud of Eastern TV. Jones was unwilling to fully commit to the gruelling filming schedule and was dealing with the murder of a friend at the time, leading him to lash out violently at the producers and filming crew. The production issues were worked into the show's concept, which now focused on the culture clash between the gangsta rapper and the \\"honky\\" television producers.[2] The 11-minute presentation tape, Keeping Up with the Joneses,[4] also featured Jones' longtime girlfriend Chrissy Lampkin and his mother Nancy. According to Springman, VH1 loved the footage but were unsure if audiences would be invested in the concept full time.[5]\\r\\nJones' manager, Yandy Smith, approached Mona Scott-Young, her former employer at Violator, to retool the show.[6] The concept was tweaked to include Jim's girlfriend Chrissy Lampkin and her circle of friends, influenced by the female ensemble-driven reality shows of the time.[7] The original cast consisted of Lampkin, Olivia Longott, Swizz Beatz's ex-wife Mashonda Tifrere and Misa Hylton-Brim, the mother of Puffy Daddy's eldest son, pitched as a \\"black version of Sex and the City\\".[8][9] Hylton was eventually replaced with stylist Emily Bustamante, the mother of Fabolous's son. Mashonda was downgraded to a supporting role per her request.[10] Aspiring rapper Somaya Reece was brought on late into production to replace her.[11] Reece's ex Joe Budden was approached to appear in the first season, but declined.[12]\\r\\nThe series was first announced in VH1's programming development report in April 2010, under the title Diary of a Hip Hop Girlfriend.[13] On January 4, 2011, VH1 announced that Love & Hip Hop would debut on March 6, 2011.[14][15]\\r\\nLove & Hip Hop: New York revolves around the everyday lives of women working in the male-dominated world of hip hop.

Subsequent seasons expanded to include talent managers and producers, DJs and radio personalities, stylists, video vixens, glamour models and groupies. The show has a sprawling supporting cast, consisting mostly of men in the industry, who (in most cases) share the same amount of screen time and storyline focus as the show's leads.\\r\\nThe first season starred Jim Jones' girlfriend Chrissy Lampkin, Fabolous's girlfriend Emily Bustamante, Olivia Longott and aspiring rapper Somaya Reece, with Jim Jones, his mother Nancy Jones, Somaya's manager Maurice Aguilar and Olivia's manager Rich Dollaz in supporting roles.

Over the seasons, the show has explored addiction, substance abuse, race relations, colorism, religion and the impact of incarceration on black families.\\r\\nSeveral female cast members identify as bisexual, lesbian or sexually fluid, and the show is one of the few television shows to explore LGBT issues from a black and latino perspective. In season eight, openly gay stylist Jonathan Fernandez joins the cast and in one episode reveals the horrors he suffered as a child in conversion therapy in the Dominican Republic.[23]\\r\\nThe show's first season, which focused on the female cast's struggles within the male-dominated industry of hip hop, initially received a positive critical response. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times praised the show's deconstruction of the public image of rappers, as well as the quality of the production values with \\"slick, beautiful shots of the women driving spectacular cars with no men in sight\\". However, he was critical of the \\"needless filler drama\\" between Lampkin and Reese,[24] a criticism that was shared by other critics who felt the \\"endless catty arguments and trashy behavior\\" detracted from the show's message[25] and was too derivative of The Real Housewives franchise.[26]\\r\\nSubsequent seasons, particularly the spin-off Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta, have largely been overshadowed by criticism and controversy, with the franchise referred to as \\"ratchet TV\\" for its seemingly negative and stereotypical portrayal of black women and its focus on dysfunctional relationships, materialism, hyper-sexuality and violence.[27] Series creator Mona Scott-Young has been singled out in particular for allegedly \\"exploiting (black women) in her quest for the almighty dollar\\".[28][29] Scott-Young has continuously defended the show against these accusations, saying it was not created to represent all African-Americans: \\"It's set in a specific world and I dont think that theres anybody whos navigated that world who would deny that these things happen.[30] Despite the criticism, the franchise has dominated the ratings since its inception, and has been described as \\"riveting\\",[31] \\"addictive\\"[32] \\"bawdy and hilarious\\"[33] and a \\"guilty pleasure\\".[34] In 2014, Complex named Joe Budden, Chrissy Lampkin and Mama Jones as some of the greatest VH1 reality stars of all time.[35]\\r\\nLove & Hip Hop is often criticized for appearing to fabricate much of its storyline. Scott-Young has denied those claims: I cant stress enough that the stuff they deal with on (Love & Hip Hop) is real. We may frame it within a production construct that allows us to shoot on a schedule, but were not making up the stuff that theyre going through.[36] In October 2013, Peter Gunz admitted in an interview with Sway in the Morning to exploiting his romantic situation for a check,[37] stating \\"I was gonna get busted (for cheating) anyway. Let me get paid to get busted. Fuck it.\\" In December 2016, the show received criticism from fans after it was revealed that Yandy Smith and Mendeecees Harris were never legally married, despite taking part in a marriage ceremony live on VH1 as part of the special Love & Hip Hip Live: The Wedding.[38] In an interview with The Breakfast Club in November 2017, Cam'ron outed Kimberly Osorio as a storyline writer for the show.[39]\\r\\nLove & Hip Hop is one of the highest rated unscripted franchises in cable television history.[40] In an overview of the television cultural divide, The New York Times reported that Love & Hip Hop was most popular show in the black belt.[41]\\r\\nAfter a modest start, the show's audience grew substantially in its second season, averaging 2.8 million total viewers per episode, making it VH1's highest rated series in over three and a half years.[42] Overall, the series was the #8 highest rating series on cable in 2011.[43] However, following a cast retooling after nearly all of the original cast left the show, the show was met with mixed reception from audiences, with the third season garnering some of the lowest ratings in the franchise's history.[44] Following another cast retooling and a much publicised love triangle storyline involving Peter Gunz, Tara and Amina (reminiscent of the more popular Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta), the show's ratings improved significantly, up 54% over the previous season's average and attracting an average of 3 million total viewers per episode.[45] The show maintained a steady viewership of about two million viewers per episode for the next few seasons, until the poorly received eighth season, where ratings dipped below 2 million viewers for the first time in four years.\\r\\nDuring a speech at a campaign rally in North Carolina on November 4, 2016, President Barack Obama referenced the show, comparing the 2016 presidential race to reality television, saying \\"I mean, its like some Love & Hip Hop stuff.\\" [46]\\r\\nOn a 2013 episode of the BET television series The Game, Wendy Raquel Robinson's character Tasha makes reference to the franchise, saying \\"Back in the day we weren't carrying ourselves like them damn crazies you see on Love & Hip Hop, we conducted ourselves as upstanding women who were looked up to in the community\\". In the 2016 film Barbershop: The Next Cut, when Eve and Common's characters get into an argument over their relationship, Cedric the Entertainer's character makes a reference to the franchise, saying \\"This ain't no Love & Hip Hop reunion.\\" In the 2017 pilot of the Netflix television adaptation Dear White People, a character attempts to break up an argument between two female characters by saying \\"Yo, fam, can we cut the Love & Hip Hop auditions and get to it?\\"\\r\\nNicki Minaj references the show on her remix of Ciara's \\"I'm Out\\".

The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from three days to timeless matches.[3][4] The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877;[5] since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 11 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because of the increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.[6]\\r\\nCricket is, by its nature, capable of generating large numbers of records and statistics.[7] This list details the most significant team and individual records in Test cricket.\\r\\nThe most successful team in Test cricket, in terms of both wins and win percentage, is Australia, having won 362 of their 773 Tests (46.83%). Barring the ICC World XI, a rest of world team which played a single Test against Australia in 2005, the least successful team are Bangladesh who have struggled since their introduction to Test cricket in 2000, leading to questioning of their Test status.[8][9][10]\\r\\nAustralian Donald Bradman, widely considered the greatest batsman of all time,[11][12] holds several personal and partnership records. He scored the most runs in a series, has the most double centuries and was a part of the record 5th wicket partnership. His most significant record is his batting average of 99.94. One of cricket's most famous statistics,[13][14] it stands almost 40 runs higher than any other batsman's average. Don Bradman is the only player in the world to have scored 5000 runs against a single opposition: 5028 runs against England.[15]\\r\\nIn the Manchester Test of 1956, England spin bowler Jim Laker took 19 wickets for 90 runs (19ÿ90) which set not only the Test record for best match figures but also the first-class one.[16] In taking 10ÿ53 in the second innings he became the first bowler to capture all ten wickets in a Test match innings, and his analysis remains the best innings figures. Indian Leg-spinner Anil Kumble is the only other bowler to have taken 10 wickets in an innings, claiming 10ÿ74 against Pakistan in 1999.[17] West Indies batsman Brian Lara has the highest individual score in Test cricket: he scored 400 not out against England in 2004 to surpass the innings of 380 by Matthew Hayden six months earlier. Lara had held the record before Hayden, with a score of 375 against England 10 years earlier.[18] Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq holds the record of the fastest test half century scoring 50 runs from 21 balls. The record for the fastest test century is held by New Zealand's Brendon McCullum who scored 100 runs from 54 balls in his final test match.\\r\\nThe trend of countries to increase the number of Test matches they play means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern players. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan became the highest Test wicket-taker in December 2007, when he passed Shane Warne's total of 708 wickets.[19] Within a year, the equivalent batting record of highest run-scorer had also changed hands: Sachin Tendulkar surpassed the tally of 11,953 runs by Brian Lara.[20] The record for most dismissals by a wicket-keeper is held by Mark Boucher of South Africa[21] while the record for most catches by a fielder is held by Rahul Dravid.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general the top five are listed in each category (except when there is a tie for the last place among the five, when all the tied record holders are noted).\\r\\nLast updated: 29 October 2017[24]\\r\\nLast updated: 12 December 2016[25]\\r\\nLast updated: 12 December 2016[26]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[27][28][29]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[30]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[31]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[32]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[33]\\r\\nLast updated: 14 September 2017[34]\\r\\nLast updated: 14 September 2017[35]\\r\\nLast updated: 14 September 2017[36]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[37]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[38]\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\nLast updated: 17 March 2017[39]\\r\\nQualification: 20 innings.\\r\\nLast updated: 30 August 2017[40]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2015[41]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[42]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[43]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[44]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2015[45]\\r\\nLast updated: 17 March January 2017[46]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2015[47]\\r\\nLast updated: 14 August 2017[48]\\r\\nMost Test centuries\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 9 September 2017[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[51]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[52]\\r\\nLast updated: 11 December 2016[53]\\r\\n21 other players have scored a triple century in a Test: see List of Test cricket triple centuries for more details[54]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[55]\\r\\nMost Test 50+\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[56]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[57]\\r\\nLast updated: 15 February 2016[58] Notes:\\r\\nLast updated: 15 June 2016[59]\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n^[a] Allen Hill took the first Test wicket, but only two in the First Test match.

It grows wild in tropical climates around the world and is cultivated for agricultural and medicinal uses. Aloe is also used for decorative purposes and grows successfully indoors as a potted plant.[3]\\r\\nIt is found in many consumer products including beverages, skin lotion, cosmetics, or ointments for minor burns and sunburns. There is little scientific evidence of the effectiveness or safety of Aloe vera extracts for either cosmetic or medicinal purposes. Studies finding positive evidence are frequently contradicted by other studies.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAloe vera is a stemless or very short-stemmed plant growing to 60ÿ100?cm (24ÿ39?in) tall, spreading by offsets. The leaves are thick and fleshy, green to grey-green, with some varieties showing white flecks on their upper and lower stem surfaces.[7] The margin of the leaf is serrated and has small white teeth. The flowers are produced in summer on a spike up to 90?cm (35?in) tall, each flower being pendulous, with a yellow tubular corolla 2ÿ3?cm (0.8ÿ1.2?in) long.[7][8] Like other Aloe species, Aloe vera forms arbuscular mycorrhiza, a symbiosis that allows the plant better access to mineral nutrients in soil.[9]\\r\\nAloe vera leaves contain phytochemicals under study for possible bioactivity, such as acetylated mannans, polymannans, anthraquinone C-glycosides, anthrones, other anthraquinones, such as emodin and various lectins.[4][10][11]\\r\\nThe species has a number of synonyms: A. barbadensis Mill., Aloe indica Royle, Aloe perfoliata L. var. vera and A. vulgaris Lam.[12][13] Common names include Chinese Aloe, Indian Aloe, True Aloe, Barbados Aloe, Burn Aloe, First Aid Plant.[8][14][15][16][17] The species epithet vera means \\"true\\" or \\"genuine\\".[14] Some literature identifies the white-spotted form of Aloe vera as Aloe vera var. chinensis;[18][19] however, the species varies widely with regard to leaf spots[20] and it has been suggested that the spotted form of Aloe vera may be conspecific with A. massawana.[21] The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Aloe perfoliata var. vera,[22] and was described again in 1768 by Nicolaas Laurens Burman as Aloe vera in Flora Indica on 6 April and by Philip Miller as Aloe barbadensis some ten days after Burman in the Gardener's Dictionary.[23]\\r\\nTechniques based on DNA comparison suggest Aloe vera is relatively closely related to Aloe perryi, a species endemic to Yemen.[24] Similar techniques, using chloroplast DNA sequence comparison and ISSR profiling have also suggested it is closely related to Aloe forbesii, Aloe inermis, Aloe scobinifolia, Aloe sinkatana, and Aloe striata.[25] With the exception of the South African species A. striata, these Aloe species are native to Socotra (Yemen), Somalia, and Sudan.[25] The lack of obvious natural populations of the species has led some authors to suggest Aloe vera may be of hybrid origin.[26]\\r\\nA.?vera is considered to be native only to the south-west Arabian Peninsula.[27] However, it has been widely cultivated around the world, and has become naturalised in North Africa (Morocco, Mauritania, Egypt), as well as Sudan and neighbouring countries, along with the Canary, Cape Verde, and Madeira Islands.[12] The species was introduced to China and various parts of southern Europe in the 17th century.[28] It is widely naturalized elsewhere, occurring in temperate and tropical regions of Australia, South America, Mexico, the Caribbean and southeastern US states.[27][29] The current distribution has been suggested to be the result of human cultivation (anthropogenic).[21][30]\\r\\nAloe vera has been widely grown as an ornamental plant. The species is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens.[7] The species is hardy in zones 8ÿ11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow.[8][31] The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health.[32][33] This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[34]\\r\\nIn pots, the species requires well-drained, sandy potting soil and bright, sunny conditions. Aloe plants can burn under too much sun or shrivel when the pot does not drain water. The use of a good-quality commercial propagation mix or packaged \\"cacti and succulent mix\\" is recommended, as they allow good drainage.[35] Terra cotta pots are preferable as they are porous.[35] Potted plants should be allowed to completely dry before rewatering. When potted, aloes can become crowded with \\"pups\\" growing from the sides of the \\"mother plant\\". Plants that have become crowded should be divided and repotted to allow room for further growth and help prevent pest infestations. During winter, Aloe vera may become dormant, during which little moisture is required. In areas that receive frost or snow, the species is best kept indoors or in heated glasshouses.[8]\\r\\nThere is large-scale agricultural production of Aloe vera in Australia,[36] Bangladesh, Cuba,[37] the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico,[38] India,[39] Jamaica,[40] Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa,[41] along with the USA[42] to supply the cosmetics industry.\\r\\nThere is little scientific evidence of the effectiveness or safety of Aloe vera extracts for either cosmetic or medicinal purposes. A research study finding positive evidence is frequently contradicted by other studies.[4][5][6][43]\\r\\nDespite this, the cosmetic and alternative medicine industries regularly make claims regarding the soothing, moisturizing, and healing properties of aloe vera.[4][44]\\r\\nTwo 2009 reviews of clinical studies determined that all were too small and faulty to allow strong conclusions to be drawn.[43][45] One of the reviews found that Aloe has not been proven to offer protection for humans from sunburn.[45]\\r\\nThere is no good evidence aloe vera is of use in treating wounds or burns.[46][47] There is no good evidence that topical application of aloe vera is effective for treating genital herpes or psoriasis.[48] A 2014 Cochrane review found no strong evidence for the value of topical application of aloe vera to treat or prevent phlebitis caused by intravenous infusion.[49]\\r\\nAloe vera gel is used commercially as an ingredient in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts,[50][51][52] although at certain doses, its toxic properties could be severe whether ingested or topically applied.[53] The same is true for aloe latex, which was taken orally for conditions ranging from glaucoma to multiple sclerosis until the FDA required manufacturers to discontinue its use.[54]\\r\\nAloin, a compound found in the exudate of some Aloe species, was the common ingredient in over-the-counter (OTC) laxative products in the United States until 2002 when the Food and Drug Administration banned it because the companies manufacturing it failed to provide the necessary safety data.[55][56] Aloe vera has potential toxicity, with side effects occurring at some dose levels both when ingested or applied topically.[53] Although toxicity may be less when aloin is removed by processing, Aloe vera that contains aloin in excess amounts may induce side effects.[4][43][57]\\r\\nAloe vera juice is marketed to support the health of the digestive system, but there is neither scientific evidence nor regulatory approval to support this claim.[58] The extracts and quantities typically used for such purposes appear to be dose-dependent for toxic effects.[53]\\r\\nAloe vera is used in traditional medicine as a skin treatment. In Ayurvedic medicine it is called kathalai, as are extracts from agave.[59]:196 for aloe:117 for agave Early records of Aloe vera use appear in the Ebers Papyrus from the 16th century BC,[17]:18 and in Dioscorides' De Materia Medica and Pliny the Elder's Natural History?ÿ both written in the mid-first century AD.[17]:20 It is also written of in the Juliana Anicia Codex of 512 AD.[50]:9 The plant is used widely in the traditional herbal medicine of many countries.\\r\\nAloe vera is used on facial tissues where it is promoted as a moisturiser and anti-irritant to reduce chafing of the nose. Cosmetic companies commonly add sap or other derivatives from Aloe vera to products such as makeup, tissues, moisturizers, soaps, sunscreens, incense, shaving cream, or shampoos.[50] A review of academic literature notes that its inclusion in many hygiene products is due to its \\"moisturizing emollient effect\\".[11]\\r\\nOther potential uses for extracts of Aloe vera include the dilution of semen for the artificial fertilization of sheep,[60] as a fresh food preservative,[61] or for water conservation in small farms.[62] It has also been suggested that biofuels could be obtained from Aloe vera seeds.[63]\\r\\nUnder the guidelines of California Proposition 65, orally ingested non-decolorized aloe vera leaf extract has been listed by the OEHHA, along with goldenseal, among \\"chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity\\".[64]\\r\\nUse of topical aloe vera is not associated with significant side effects.[55] Oral ingestion of aloe vera, however, may cause abdominal cramps and diarrhea which in turn can decrease the absorption of drugs.[55] IARC studies have found ingested non-decolorized liquid aloe vera[65] to be carcinogenic in animals, and state that it is a possible carcinogen in humans as well.[66]","input":"What are the uses of aloe vera flower?"},{"output":"Symphony No. 1 in E? major, K. 16","context":"The Symphony No. 1 in E? major, K. 16, was written in 1764 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at the age of eight years.[1] By this time, he was already notable in Europe as a wunderkind performer, but had composed little music.\\r\\nThe autograph score of the symphony is today preserved in the Biblioteka Jagielloska in Krak܇w.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe piece was written on the Mozart family's Grand Tour of Europe in London when they had to move to Chelsea during the summer of 1764 due to Mozart's father Leopold's illness (throat infection).[1][2] The house at 180 Ebury Street, now in the borough of Westminster, where this symphony was written, is marked with a plaque.

This plasma consists of mostly electrons, protons and alpha particles with kinetic energy between 0.5 and 10 keV. Embedded within the solar-wind plasma is the interplanetary magnetic field.[2] The solar wind varies in density, temperature and speed over time and over solar latitude and longitude. Its particles can escape the Sun's gravity because of their high energy resulting from the high temperature of the corona, which in turn is a result of the coronal magnetic field.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a distance of more than a few solar radii from the Sun, the solar wind is supersonic and reaches speeds of 250 to 750 kilometers per second.[3] The flow of the solar wind is no longer supersonic at the termination shock. The Voyager 2 spacecraft crossed the shock more than five times between 30 August and 10 December 2007.[4] Voyager 2 crossed the shock about a billion kilometers closer to the Sun than the 13.5-billion-kilometer distance where Voyager 1 came upon the termination shock.[5][6] The spacecraft moved outward through the termination shock into the heliosheath and onward toward the interstellar medium. Other related phenomena include the aurora (northern and southern lights), the plasma tails of comets that always point away from the Sun, and geomagnetic storms that can change the direction of magnetic field lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe existence of particles flowing outward from the Sun to the Earth was first suggested by British astronomer Richard C. Carrington. In 1859, Carrington and Richard Hodgson independently made the first observation of what would later be called a solar flare. This is a sudden, localised increase in brightness on the solar disc, which is now known[7] to often occur in conjunction with an episodic ejection of material and magnetic flux from the Sun's atmosphere, known as a coronal mass ejection. On the following day, a geomagnetic storm was observed, and Carrington suspected that there might be a connection, which is now attributed to the arrival of the coronal mass ejection in near-Earth space and its subsequent interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere. George FitzGerald later suggested that matter was being regularly accelerated away from the Sun and was reaching the Earth after several days.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1910 British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington essentially suggested the existence of the solar wind, without naming it, in a footnote to an article on Comet Morehouse.[9] The idea never fully caught on even though Eddington had also made a similar suggestion at a Royal Institution address the previous year. In the latter case, he postulated that the ejected material consisted of electrons while in his study of Comet Morehouse he supposed them to be ions.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first person to suggest that the ejected material consisted of both ions and electrons was Kristian Birkeland.[10] His geomagnetic surveys showed that auroral activity was nearly uninterrupted. As these displays and other geomagnetic activity were being produced by particles from the Sun, he concluded that the Earth was being continually bombarded by \\"rays of electric corpuscles emitted by the Sun\\".[8] In 1916, Birkeland proposed that, \\"From a physical point of view it is most probable that solar rays are neither exclusively negative nor positive rays, but of both kinds\\". In other words, the solar wind consists of both negative electrons and positive ions.[11] Three years later in 1919, Frederick Lindemann also suggested that particles of both polarities, protons as well as electrons, come from the Sun.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the 1930s, scientists had determined that the temperature of the solar corona must be a million degrees Celsius because of the way it stood out into space (as seen during total eclipses). Later spectroscopic work confirmed this extraordinary temperature. In the mid-1950s Sydney Chapman calculated the properties of a gas at such a temperature and determined it was such a superb conductor of heat that it must extend way out into space, beyond the orbit of Earth. Also in the 1950s, Ludwig Biermann became interested in the fact that no matter whether a comet is headed towards or away from the Sun, its tail always points away from the Sun. Biermann postulated that this happens because the Sun emits a steady stream of particles that pushes the comet's tail away.[13] Wilfried Schr?der claimed that Paul Ahnert was the first to relate solar wind to comet tail direction based on observations of the comet Whipple-Fedke (1942g).[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nEugene Parker realised heat flowing from the Sun in Chapman's model and the comet tail blowing away from the Sun in Biermann's hypothesis had to be the result of the same phenomenon, which he termed the \\"solar wind\\".[15][16] In 1957, Parker showed,  even though the Sun's corona is strongly attracted by solar gravity, it is such a good heat conductor that it is still very hot at large distances. Since gravity weakens as distance from the Sun increases, the outer coronal atmosphere escapes supersonically into interstellar space. Furthermore, Parker was the first person to notice that the weakening effect of the gravity has the same effect on hydrodynamic flow as a de Laval nozzle: it incites a transition from subsonic to supersonic flow.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOpposition to Parker's hypothesis on the solar wind was strong. The paper he submitted to The Astrophysical Journal in 1958 was rejected by two reviewers. It was saved by the editor Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1959, the Soviet spacecraft Luna 1 first directly observed the solar wind and measured its strength,[18][19][20] using hemispherical ion traps. The discovery, made by Konstantin Gringauz, was verified by Luna 2, Luna 3 and by the more distant measurements of Venera 1. Three years later a similar measurement was performed by Neugebauer and collaborators using the Mariner 2 spacecraft.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, the Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrometer (UVCS) instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft observed the acceleration region of the fast solar wind emanating from the poles of the Sun and found that the wind accelerates much faster than can be accounted for by thermodynamic expansion alone. Parker's model predicted that the wind should make the transition to supersonic flow at an altitude of about 4 solar radii from the photosphere (surface); but the transition (or \\"sonic point\\") now appears to be much lower, perhaps only 1 solar radius above the photosphere, suggesting that some additional mechanism accelerates the solar wind away from the Sun. The acceleration of the fast wind is still not understood and cannot be fully explained by Parker's theory. The gravitational and electromagnetic explanation for this acceleration is, however, detailed in an earlier paper by 1970 Nobel laureate for Physics, Hannes Alfvn.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first numerical simulation of the solar wind in the solar corona including closed and open field lines was performed by Pneuman and Kopp in 1971. The magnetohydrodynamics equations in steady state were solved iteratively starting with an initial dipolar configuration.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, the Ulysses probe was launched to study the solar wind from high solar latitudes. All prior observations had been made at or near the Solar System's ecliptic plane.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, NASA launched the Parker Solar Probe, named in honor of Eugene Parker, on a mission to study the structure and dynamics of the solar corona, in an attempt to understand the mechanisms that cause particles to be heated and accelerated as solar wind.  During its seven year mission, the probe will make twenty-four orbits of the sun, passing further into the corona with each orbit's perihelion, ultimately passing within 0.04 astronomical units of the sun's surface.  It is the first NASA spacecraft named for a living person, and Parker himself, at age 91, was on hand to observe the launch.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile early models of the solar wind relied primarily on thermal energy to accelerate the material, by the 1960s it was clear that thermal acceleration alone cannot account for the high speed of solar wind. An additional unknown acceleration mechanism is required and likely relates to magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sun's corona, or extended outer layer, is a region of plasma that is heated to over a million kelvin. As a result of thermal collisions, the particles within the inner corona have a range and distribution of speeds described by a Maxwellian distribution. The mean velocity of these particles is about 145?km/s, which is well below the solar escape velocity of 618?km/s. However, a few of the particles achieve energies sufficient to reach the terminal velocity of 400?km/s, which allows them to feed the solar wind. At the same temperature, electrons, due to their much smaller mass, reach escape velocity and build up an electric field that further accelerates ions away from the Sun.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total number of particles carried away from the Sun by the solar wind is about 1.3G1036 per second.[28] Thus, the total mass loss each year is about (2ÿ3)G10?14 solar masses,[29] or about (1.3ÿ1.9) million tonnes per second. This is equivalent to losing a mass equal to the Earth every 150?million years.[30] However, only about 0.01% of the Sun's total mass has been lost through the solar wind.[31] Other stars have much stronger stellar winds that result in significantly higher mass loss rates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solar wind is observed to exist in two fundamental states, termed the slow solar wind and the fast solar wind, though their differences extend well beyond their speeds. In near-Earth space, the slow solar wind is observed to have a velocity of 300ÿ500?km/s, a temperature of 1.4ÿ1.6G106?K and a composition that is a close match to the corona. By contrast, the fast solar wind has a typical velocity of 750?km/s, a temperature of 8G105?K and it nearly matches the composition of the Sun's photosphere.[32] The slow solar wind is twice as dense and more variable in nature than the fast solar wind.[28][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe slow solar wind appears to originate from a region around the Sun's equatorial belt that is known as the \\"streamer belt\\", where coronal streamers are produced by magnetic flux open to the heliosphere draping over closed magnetic loops. The exact coronal structures involved in slow solar wind formation and the method by which the material is released is still under debate.[34][35][36] Observations of the Sun between 1996 and 2001 showed that emission of the slow solar wind occurred at latitudes up to 30ÿ35 during the solar minimum (the period of lowest solar activity), then expanded toward the poles as the solar cycle approached maximum. At solar maximum, the poles were also emitting a slow solar wind.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fast solar wind originates from coronal holes,[37] which are funnel-like regions of open field lines in the Sun's magnetic field.[38] Such open lines are particularly prevalent around the Sun's magnetic poles. The plasma source is small magnetic fields created by convection cells in the solar atmosphere. These fields confine the plasma and transport it into the narrow necks of the coronal funnels, which are located only 20,000?kilometers above the photosphere. The plasma is released into the funnel when these magnetic field lines reconnect.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind exerts a pressure at 1 AU typically in the range of 1ÿ6?nPa (1ÿ6G10?9?N/m2), although it can readily vary outside that range.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ram pressure is a function of wind speed and density. The formula is\\r\\n\\r\\nP = mp * n * V2= 1.6726G10?6 * n * V2\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere mp is the proton mass, pressure P is in nPa (nanopascals), n is the density in particles/cm3 and V is the speed in km/s of the solar wind.[citation needed][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the fast and slow solar wind can be interrupted by large, fast-moving bursts of plasma called interplanetary coronal mass ejections, or ICMEs. ICMEs are the interplanetary manifestation of solar coronal mass ejections, which are caused by release of magnetic energy at the Sun. CMEs are often called \\"solar storms\\" or \\"space storms\\" in the popular media. They are sometimes, but not always, associated with solar flares, which are another manifestation of magnetic energy release at the Sun. ICMEs cause shock waves in the thin plasma of the heliosphere, launching electromagnetic waves and accelerating particles (mostly protons and electrons) to form showers of ionizing radiation that precede the CME.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a CME impacts the Earth's magnetosphere, it temporarily deforms the Earth's magnetic field, changing the direction of compass needles and inducing large electrical ground currents in Earth itself; this is called a geomagnetic storm and it is a global phenomenon. CME impacts can induce magnetic reconnection in Earth's magnetotail (the midnight side of the magnetosphere); this launches protons and electrons downward toward Earth's atmosphere, where they form the aurora.\\r\\n\\r\\nICMEs are not the only cause of space weather. Different patches on the Sun are known to give rise to slightly different speeds and densities of wind depending on local conditions. In isolation, each of these different wind streams would form a spiral with a slightly different angle, with fast-moving streams moving out more directly and slow-moving streams wrapping more around the Sun. Fast moving streams tend to overtake slower streams that originate westward of them on the Sun, forming turbulent co-rotating interaction regions that give rise to wave motions and accelerated particles, and that affect Earth's magnetosphere in the same way as, but more gently than, CMEs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the Sun's lifetime, the interaction of its surface layers with the escaping solar wind has significantly decreased its surface rotation rate.[41] The wind is considered responsible for comets' tails, along with the Sun's radiation.[42] The solar wind contributes to fluctuations in celestial radio waves observed on the Earth, through an effect called interplanetary scintillation.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the solar wind intersects with a planet that has a well-developed magnetic field (such as Earth, Jupiter or Saturn), the particles are deflected by the Lorentz force. This region, known as the magnetosphere, causes the particles to travel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere or surface. The magnetosphere is roughly shaped like a hemisphere on the side facing the Sun, then is drawn out in a long wake on the opposite side. The boundary of this region is called the magnetopause, and some of the particles are able to penetrate the magnetosphere through this region by partial reconnection of the magnetic field lines.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solar wind is responsible for the overall shape of Earth's magnetosphere. Fluctuations in its speed, density, direction, and entrained magnetic field strongly affect Earth's local space environment. For example, the levels of ionizing radiation and radio interference can vary by factors of hundreds to thousands; and the shape and location of the magnetopause and bow shock wave upstream of it can change by several Earth radii, exposing geosynchronous satellites to the direct solar wind. These phenomena are collectively called space weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the European Space Agency's Cluster mission, a new study has taken place that proposes that it is easier for the solar wind to infiltrate the magnetosphere than previously believed. A group of scientists directly observed the existence of certain waves in the solar wind that were not expected. A recent study shows that these waves enable incoming charged particles of solar wind to breach the magnetopause. This suggests that the magnetic bubble forms more as a filter than a continuous barrier. This latest discovery occurred through the distinctive arrangement of the four identical Cluster spacecraft, which fly in a controlled configuration through near-Earth space. As they sweep from the magnetosphere into interplanetary space and back again, the fleet provides exceptional three-dimensional insights on the phenomena that connect the sun to Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe research characterised variances in formation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) largely influenced by KelvinÿHelmholtz instability (which occur at the interface of two fluids) as a result of differences in thickness and numerous other characteristics of the boundary layer. Experts believe that this was the first occasion that the appearance of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves at the magnetopause had been displayed at high latitude dawnward orientation of the IMF. These waves are being seen in unforeseen places under solar wind conditions that were formerly believed to be undesired for their generation. These discoveries show how Earth's magnetosphere can be penetrated by solar particles under specific IMF circumstances. The findings are also relevant to studies of magnetospheric progressions around other planetary bodies. This study suggests that Kelvin-Helmholtz waves can be a somewhat common, and possibly constant, instrument for the entrance of solar wind into terrestrial magnetospheres under various IMF orientations.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solar wind affects other incoming cosmic rays interacting with planetary atmospheres. Moreover, planets with a weak or non-existent magnetosphere are subject to atmospheric stripping by the solar wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nVenus, the nearest and most similar planet to Earth, has 100 times denser atmosphere, with little or no geo-magnetic field. Space probes discovered a comet-like tail that extends to Earth's orbit.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarth itself is largely protected from the solar wind by its magnetic field, which deflects most of the charged particles; however some of the charged particles are trapped in the Van Allen radiation belt. A smaller number of particles from the solar wind manage to travel, as though on an electromagnetic energy transmission line, to the Earth's upper atmosphere and ionosphere in the auroral zones. The only time the solar wind is observable on the Earth is when it is strong enough to produce phenomena such as the aurora and geomagnetic storms. Bright auroras strongly heat the ionosphere, causing its plasma to expand into the magnetosphere, increasing the size of the plasma geosphere and injecting atmospheric matter into the solar wind. Geomagnetic storms result when the pressure of plasmas contained inside the magnetosphere is sufficiently large to inflate and thereby distort the geomagnetic field.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Mars is larger than Mercury and four times farther from the Sun, it is thought that the solar wind has stripped away up to a third of its original atmosphere, leaving a layer 1/100th as dense as the Earth's. It is believed the mechanism for this atmospheric stripping is gas caught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.[46] In 2015 the NASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission measured the rate of atmospheric stripping caused by the magnetic field carried by the solar wind as it flows past Mars, which generates an electric field, much as a turbine on Earth can be used to generate electricity. This electric field accelerates electrically charged gas atoms, called ions, in Mars' upper atmosphere and shoots them into space.[47] The MAVEN mission measured the rate of atmospheric stripping at about 100 grams (1/4 lb) per second.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nMercury, the nearest planet to the Sun, bears the full brunt of the solar wind, and since its atmosphere is vestigial and transient, its surface is bathed in radiation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMercury has an intrinsic magnetic field, so under normal solar wind conditions, the solar wind cannot penetrate its magnetosphere and particles only reach the surface in the cusp regions. During coronal mass ejections, however, the magnetopause may get pressed into the surface of the planet, and under these conditions, the solar wind may interact freely with the planetary surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth's Moon has no atmosphere or intrinsic magnetic field, and consequently its surface is bombarded with the full solar wind. The Project Apollo missions deployed passive aluminum collectors in an attempt to sample the solar wind, and lunar soil returned for study confirmed that the lunar regolith is enriched in atomic nuclei deposited from the solar wind. These elements may prove useful resources for lunar colonies.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solar wind \\"blows a bubble\\" in the interstellar medium (the rarefied hydrogen and helium gas that permeates the galaxy). The point where the solar wind's strength is no longer great enough to push back the interstellar medium is known as the heliopause and is often considered to be the outer border of the Solar System. The distance to the heliopause is not precisely known and probably depends on the current velocity of the solar wind and the local density of the interstellar medium, but it is far outside Pluto's orbit. Scientists hope to gain perspective on the heliopause from data acquired through the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission, launched in October 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nFox, Karen C.

HamMiqd?, Ashkenazi: Beis HaMikdosh; Ge'ez: ?? ?????: Bet? M?qd?s) was any of a series of structures which were located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, the current site of the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque. These successive temples stood at this location and functioned as a site of ancient Israelite and later Jewish worship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hebrew name given in the Hebrew Bible for the building complex is either Beit YHWH (House of Yahweh, or Jehovah), Beit HaElohim \\"House of God\\", or simply Beiti \\"my house\\", Beitekhah \\"your house\\" etc. The term hekhal \\"hall\\" or main building is often translated \\"temple\\" in older English Bibles. In rabbinical literature the temple is Beit HaMikdash, \\"The Sanctified House\\", and only the Temple in Jerusalem is referred to by this name.\\r\\nThe Hebrew Bible says that the First Temple was built in 957 BCE[1] by King Solomon.[2] According to the Book of Deuteronomy, as the sole place of Israelite sacrifice (Deuteronomy 12:2-27), the Temple replaced the Tabernacle constructed in the Sinai Desert under the auspices of Moses, as well as local sanctuaries, and altars in the hills.[3] This temple was sacked a few decades later by Shoshenq I, Pharaoh of Egypt.[4]\\r\\nAlthough efforts were made at partial reconstruction, it was only in 835 BCE when Jehoash, King of Judah in the second year of his reign invested considerable sums in reconstruction, only to have it stripped again for Sennacherib, King of Assyria c. 700 BCE. The First Temple was totally destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE (425 BCE according to historical Jewish sources), when they sacked the city.[5]\\r\\nAccording to the Book of Ezra, construction of the Second Temple was authorized by Cyrus the Great and began in 538 BCE, after the fall of the Babylonian Empire the year before. It was completed 23 years later, on the third day of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the Great (12 March 515 BCE),[6] dedicated by the Jewish governor Zerubbabel. However, with a full reading of the Book of Ezra and the Book of Nehemiah, there were four edicts to build the Second Temple, which were issued by three kings. Cyrus in 536 BCE, which is recorded in the first chapter of Ezra. Next, Darius I of Persia in 519 BCE, which is recorded in the sixth chapter of Ezra. Third, Artaxerxes I of Persia in 457 BCE, which was the seventh year of his reign, and is recorded in the seventh chapter of Ezra. Finally, by Artaxerxes again in 444 BCE in the second chapter of Nehemiah.[7] Also, despite the fact that the new temple was not as extravagant or imposing as its predecessor, it still dominated the Jerusalem skyline and remained an important structure throughout the time of Persian suzerainty. Moreover, the temple narrowly avoided being destroyed again in 332 BCE when the Jews refused to acknowledge the deification of Alexander the Great of Macedonia. Alexander was allegedly \\"turned from his anger\\" at the last minute by astute diplomacy and flattery. Further, after the death of Alexander on 13 June 323 BCE, and the dismembering of his empire, the Ptolemies came to rule over Judea and the Temple. Under the Ptolemies, the Jews were given many civil liberties and lived content under their rule. However, when the Ptolemaic army was defeated at Panium by Antiochus III of the Seleucids in 198 BCE, this policy changed. Antiochus wanted to Hellenize the Jews, attempting to introduce the Greek pantheon into the temple. Moreover, a rebellion ensued and was brutally crushed, but no further action by Antiochus was taken, and when Antiochus died in 187 BCE at Luristan, his son Seleucus IV Philopator succeeded him. However, his policies never took effect in Judea, since he was assassinated the year after his ascension.\\r\\nAntiochus IV Epiphanes succeeded his older brother to the Seleucid throne and immediately adopted his father's previous policy of universal Hellenisation. The Jews rebelled again and Antiochus, in a rage, retaliated in force. Considering the previous episodes of discontent, the Jews became incensed when the religious observances of Sabbath and circumcision were officially outlawed. When Antiochus erected a statue of Zeus in their temple and Hellenic priests began sacrificing pigs (the usual sacrifice offered to the Greek gods in the Hellenic religion), their anger began to spiral. When a Greek official ordered a Jewish priest to perform a Hellenic sacrifice, the priest (Mattathias) killed him. In 167 BCE, the Jews rose up en masse behind Mattathias and his five sons to fight and win their freedom from Seleucid authority. Mattathias' son Judas Maccabaeus, now called \\"The Hammer\\", re-dedicated the temple in 165 BCE and the Jews celebrate this event to this day as a major part of the festival of Hanukkah.\\r\\nThe temple was rededicated under Judas Maccabaeus in 164 BCE.[2] During the Roman era, Pompey entered (and thereby desecrated) the Holy of Holies in 63 BCE, but left the Temple intact.[8][9][10] In 54 BCE, Crassus looted the Temple treasury,[11][12] only for him to die the year after at the Battle of Carrhae against Parthia. According to folklore he was executed by having molten gold poured down his throat. When news of this reached the Jews, they revolted again, only to be put down in 43 BCE.\\r\\nAround 20 BCE, the building was renovated and expanded by Herod the Great, and became known as Herod's Temple. It was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE during the Siege of Jerusalem. During the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Romans in 132ÿ135 CE, Simon bar Kokhba and Rabbi Akiva wanted to rebuild the Temple, but bar Kokhba's revolt failed and the Jews were banned from Jerusalem (except for Tisha B'Av) by the Roman Empire. The emperor Julian allowed to have the Temple rebuilt but the Galilee earthquake of 363 ended all attempts ever since.\\r\\nAfter the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem in the 7th century, Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ordered the construction of an Islamic shrine, the Dome of the Rock, on the site of the Temple. The shrine has stood on the mount since 691 CE; the al-Aqsa Mosque, from roughly the same period, also stands in the Temple courtyard.\\r\\nThe Temple Mount, along with the entire Old City of Jerusalem, was captured from Jordan by Israel in 1967 during the Six-Day War, allowing Jews once again to pray at the holy site.[13][14][clarification needed] Jordan had occupied East Jerusalem and the Temple Mount immediately following Israel's declaration of independence on May 14, 1948. Israel officially unified East Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount, with the rest of Jerusalem in 1980 under the Jerusalem Law, though United Nations Security Council Resolution 478 declared the Jerusalem Law to be in violation of international law.[15] The Muslim Waqf, based in Jordan, has administrative control of the Temple Mount.\\r\\nThere are four theories as to where the Temple stood; where the Dome of the Rock is now located, to the north of the Dome of the Rock (Professor Asher Kaufman), to the east of the Dome of the Rock (Professor Joseph Patrich of the Hebrew University).[16] and to the south of the Temple Mount on Mount Ophel.[17][18][19][20]\\r\\nThe Temple of Solomon or First Temple consisted of three main elements:\\r\\nIn the case of the last and most elaborate structure, the Herodian Temple, the structure consisted of the wider Temple precinct, the restricted Temple courts, and the Temple building itself:\\r\\nAccording to the Talmud, the Women's Court was to the east and the main area of the Temple to the west.[21] The main area contained the butchering area for the sacrifices and the Outer Altar on which portions of most offerings were burned. An edifice contained the ulam (antechamber), the hekhal (the \\"sanctuary\\"), and the Holy of Holies. The sanctuary and the Holy of Holies were separated by a wall in the First Temple and by two curtains in the Second Temple. The sanctuary contained the seven branched candlestick, the table of showbread and the Incense Altar.\\r\\nThe main courtyard had thirteen gates. On the south side, beginning with the southwest corner, there were four gates:\\r\\nOn the north side, beginning with the northwest corner, there were four gates:\\r\\nOn the east side was Shaar Nikanor, between the Women's Courtyard and the main Temple Courtyard, which had two minor doorways, one on its right and one on its left. On the western wall, which was relatively unimportant, there were two gates that did not have any name.\\r\\nThe Mishnah lists concentric circles of holiness surrounding the Temple: Holy of Holies; Sanctuary; Vestibule; Court of the Priests; Court of the Israelites; Court of the Women; Temple Mount; the walled city of Jerusalem; all the walled cities of the Land of Israel; and the borders of the Land of Israel.\\r\\nThe Temple was the place where offerings described in the course of the Hebrew Bible were carried out, including daily morning and afternoon offerings and special offerings on Sabbath and Jewish holidays. Levites recited Psalms at appropriate moments during the offerings, including the Psalm of the Day, special psalms for the new month, and other occasions, the Hallel during major Jewish holidays, and psalms for special sacrifices such as the \\"Psalm for the Thanksgiving Offering\\" (Psalm 100).\\r\\nAs part of the daily offering, a prayer service was performed in the Temple which was used as the basis of the traditional Jewish (morning) service recited to this day, including well-known prayers such as the Shema, and the Priestly Blessing. The Mishna describes it as follows:\\r\\nThe superintendent said to them, bless one benediction! and they blessed, and read the Ten Commandments, and the Shema, \\"And it shall come to pass if you will hearken\\", and \\"And [God] spoke...\\". They pronounced three benedictions with the people present: \\"True and firm\\", and the \\"Avodah\\" \\"Accept, Lord our God, the service of your people Israel, and the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer receive with favor. Blessed is He who receives the service of His people Israel with favor\\" (similar to what is today the 17th blessing of the Amidah), and the Priestly Blessing, and on the Sabbath they recited one blessing; \\"May He who causes His name to dwell in this House, cause to dwell among you love and brotherliness, peace and friendship\\" on behalf of the weekly Priestly Guard that departed.\\r\\nThe Talmud (Yoma 9b) provides traditional theological reasons for the destruction: \\"Why was the first Temple destroyed? Because the three cardinal sins were rampant in society: idol worship, licentiousness, and murder And why then was the second Temple ÿ wherein the society was involved in Torah, commandments and acts of kindness ÿ destroyed? Because gratuitous hatred was rampant in society. This teaches you that gratuitous hatred is equal in severity to the three cardinal sins: idol worship, licentiousness, and murder.\\"[23][24]\\r\\nPart of the traditional Jewish morning service, the part surrounding the Shema prayer, is essentially unchanged from the daily worship service performed in the Temple. In addition, the Amidah prayer traditionally replaces the Temple's daily tamid and special-occasion Mussaf (additional) offerings (there are separate versions for the different types of sacrifices). They are recited during the times their corresponding offerings were performed in the Temple.\\r\\nThe Temple is mentioned extensively in Orthodox services. Conservative Judaism retains mentions of the Temple and its restoration, but removes references to the sacrifices. References to sacrifices on holidays are made in the past tense, and petitions for their restoration are removed. Mentions in Orthodox Jewish services include:\\r\\nThe destruction of the Temple is mourned on the Jewish fast day of Tisha B'Av. Three other minor fasts (Tenth of Tevet, 17th of Tammuz, and Third of Tishrei), also mourn events leading to or following the destruction of the Temple. There are also mourning practices which are observed at all times, for example, the requirement to leave part of the house unplastered.\\r\\nJesus predicts the destruction of the Second Temple (Matthew 24:2) and allegorically compares his body to a Temple that will be torn down and raised up again in three days. This idea, of the Temple as the body of Christ, became a rich and multi-layered theme in medieval Christian thought (where Temple/body can be the heavenly body of Christ, the ecclesial body of the Church, and the Eucharistic body on the altar).[25]\\r\\nThe Temple Mount bears significance in Islam as it acted as a sanctuary for many Hebrew prophets. Islamic tradition says that a temple was first built on the Temple Mount by Jacob and later renovated by Solomon, son of David. In addition, it is considered to be the site of Muhammad's Night Journey and his ascent into Heaven (Isra and Mi'raj), one of the most significant events recounted in the Qur'an.\\r\\nAccording to Muslim scholar Seyyed Hossein Nasr, professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University, Jerusalem has the significance as a holy site for Muslims primarily in three ways.[26] First, while in Mecca, Muhammad used the Temple in Jerusalem as his first qiblah (prayer direction); then, after Muhammad emigrated from Mecca to Medina, Allah permitted his prophet to turn towards Mecca in prayer sixteen months after he arrived (Sura 2:144, 149-150). Second, while Muhammad was still living in Mecca, he reports that he took a Night Journey to Bait-ul-Maqdis (i.e. Temple in Jerusalem) which is considered as a very auspicious event in Islam known as Isra. The third factor, says Nasr, is the Muslim belief in the Second Coming of Christ to Bait-ul-Maqdis (i.e. Temple in Jerusalem).\\r\\nImam Abdul Hadi Palazzi, leader of Italian Muslim Assembly, quotes the Qur'an to support Judaism's special connection to the Temple Mount. According to Palazzi, \\"The most authoritative Islamic sources affirm the Temples\\". He adds that Jerusalem is sacred to Muslims because of its prior holiness to Jews and its standing as home to the biblical prophets and kings David and Solomon, all of whom he says are sacred figures in Islam. He claims that the Qur'an \\"expressly recognizes that Jerusalem plays the same role for Jews that Mecca has for Muslims\\".[27]\\r\\nIn his 2007 book, The Fight for Jerusalem: Radical Islam, the West, and the Future of the Holy City, Dore Gold calls assertions that the Temple in Jerusalem never existed or was not located on the Mount \\"Temple Denial\\". David Hazony has described the phenomenon as \\"a campaign of intellectual erasure [by Palestinian leaders, writers, and scholars] ... aimed at undermining the Jewish claim to any part of the land\\" and compared the phenomenon to Holocaust denial.[28]\\r\\nArchaeological excavations have found remnants of both the First Temple and Second Temple. Among the artifacts of the First Temple are dozens of ritual immersion or baptismal pools in this area surrounding the Temple Mount,[29] as well as a large square platform identified by architectural archaeologist Leen Ritmeye as likely being built by king Hezekiah c. 700 BCE as a gathering area in front of the Temple.\\r\\nPossible Second Temple artifacts include the Trumpeting Place inscription and the Temple Warning inscription, which are surviving pieces of the Herodian expansion of the Temple Mount.\\r\\nEver since the Second Temple's destruction, a prayer for the construction of a Third Temple has been a formal and, by some authorities,[citation needed] optional part of the thrice-daily Jewish prayer services. However, the question of whether and when to construct the Third Temple is disputed both within the Jewish community and without; groups within Judaism argue both for and against construction of a new Temple, while the expansion of Abrahamic religion since the 1st century CE has made the issue contentious within Christian and Islamic thought as well. Furthermore, the complicated political status of Jerusalem makes reconstruction difficult, while Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock have been constructed at the traditional physical location of the Temple. When the Umayyad Caliph Abdel-Malik ibn Marwan built the Dome of the Rock, some reports indicated that the Jews were filled with elation. Some even believed that this Islamic shrine was the third temple.[citation needed] For a century, Jews had full access to this holiest of sites.\\r\\nIn 363 CE, the Roman emperor Julian had ordered Alypius of Antioch to rebuild the Temple as part of his campaign to strengthen non-Christian religions.[30] The attempt failed, perhaps due to sabotage, an accidental fire, or an earthquake in Galilee.\\r\\nThe Book of Ezekiel prophesies what would be the Third Temple, noting it as an eternal house of prayer and describing it in detail.\\r\\nJournalistic depiction of the controversies around the Jerusalem Temple was presented in the 2010 documentary Lost Temple by Serge Grankin. The film contains interviews with religious and academic authorities involved in the issue. German journalist Dirk-Martin Heinzelmann, featured in the film, presents the point of view of Prof. Joseph Patrich (the Hebrew University), stemming from the underground cistern mapping made by Charles William Wilson (1836-1905).[31]\\r\\nCoordinates: 314640N 351408E? / ?31.77765N 35.23547E? / 31.77765; 35.23547","input":"When was the temple destroyed by the babylonians?"},{"output":"as of 2016 is estimated to be 3,211,474","context":"","input":"What is the population of meghalaya in 2018?"},{"output":"\\"That '70s Finale\\"","context":"The eighth and final season of the American comedy television series That '70s Show premiered November 2, 2005 on Fox in the United States.

Kutcher had quit the show at the end of season seven but remained on the series for five episodes during the eighth season. He appeared in the first four episodes to give closure to Kelso and he appeared again in the final episode titled \\"That '70s Finale\\". Also, Leo (Tommy Chong) returned as a main character since his return to the series in the seventh season (in a special guest role). \\r\\n\\r\\nMany plots of the season involved Donna's new relationship with Randy, Jackie falling in love with Fez, Hyde getting married to a stripper named Samantha, Kelso getting a new job and moving to Chicago, and the Formans adjusting to an empty nest which is too empty for Kitty and not empty enough for Red due to the kids' presence despite Eric's absence. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis season is set entirely in 1979, with the final seconds of the series being the final seconds of the decade.

Anslinger was appointed its first commissioner by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon under President Herbert Hoover. Under Anslinger, the bureau lobbied for harsh penalties for drug usage. The FBN is credited for criminalizing drugs such as cannabis with the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, as well as strengthening the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914. Even so, the main focus of the FBN was fighting opium and heroin smuggling. One instance against opium was The Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942.[2] To that end the FBN over time established several offices overseas in France, Italy, Turkey, Beirut, Thailand and other hotspots of international narcotics smuggling. These agents (never totaling more than 17) cooperated with local drug enforcement agencies in gathering intelligence on smugglers and also made undercover busts locally. The work against heroin and opium was however hamstrung by US foreign policy considerations: during the Vietnam War for instance great importance was placed on investigating minor Vietnamese smugglers that could be connected to the resistance while investigations of large scale smugglers from the US ally Thailand were left unfinished.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnslinger retired in 1962 and was succeeded by Henry Giordano, who was the commissioner of the FBN until it was merged in 1968 with the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control, an agency of the Food and Drug Administration, to form the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, an agency of the United States Department of Justice.

The albums were recorded after Bowie took up residence in West Berlin in late 1976, and saw him experiment with elements of electronic, krautrock, ambient, and world music in collaboration with American producer Tony Visconti and English musician Brian Eno.\\r\\n\\r\\nBowie began referring to the three albums as a Berlin-centered trilogy during the promotion of Lodger, although \\"Heroes\\" was the only installment primarily recorded in the city. Each album reached the UK top five. Bowie would later call the music of the trilogy his \\"DNA\\".[1] Consequence of Sound characterized the trilogy as an \\"art rock trifecta\\",[2] while Rolling Stone wrote that the Berlin Trilogy \\"stands as some of the most innovative music in the artist's influential canon\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Bowie's Thin White Duke period and the commercial success of the singles \\"Fame\\" and \\"Golden Years\\" in 1976, he was eager to escape the drug culture of Los Angeles,[4] where he had developed a cocaine addiction.[5] He had also become embroiled in controversy regarding comments he made seemingly in favour of fascism.[6] He blamed his erratic behaviour on his addictions and precarious mental state,[7] saying \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed.\\"[8] He called the period \\"the darkest days of my life\\" and confessed to having no memory of recording of Station to Station in Los Angeles in late 1975 due to his \\"astronomic\\" cocaine addiction.[9] As his health deteriorated, Bowie attempted to reduce his cocaine intake and phase out the Thin White Duke persona, whom he had come to see as \\"a nasty character indeed.\\"[5] He said: \\"It was a dangerous period for me. I was at the end of my tether physically and emotionally and had serious doubts about my sanity.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nBowie moved to Switzerland in the second half of 1976. There, he began exploring other art forms and visiting galleries in Geneva and the Brcke Museum in Berlin, becoming (in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford) \\"a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art?... Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art, locked in Clos des Msanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography.\\"[11] Later that year, Bowie, along with friend and singer Iggy Pop, retreated to Berlin in a further attempt to escape his addiction and the spotlight:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years Berlin had appealed to me as a sort of sanctuary-like situation. It was one of the few cities where I could move around in virtual anonymity. I was going broke; it was cheap to live. For some reason, Berliners just didn't care. Well, not about an English rock singer, anyway.[12]\\r\\nWhile sharing an apartment with Pop, Bowie became interested in the German music scene, including acts such as Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk and Neu!.[13] Before moving to the apartment on Hauptstra?e, Pop and Bowie stayed with Edgar Froese of Tangerine Dream and his family at their home in Sch?neberg. Froese also helped Bowie with his recovery and introduced him to the Berlin underground scene. Bowie named Froese's solo album Epsilon in Malaysian Pale a big influence and a soundtrack to his life in Berlin.[14][15] During the months of his recovery, he had also become interested in Brian Eno's minimalist album Discreet Music (1975). He met Eno in 1976[16][17][18] and soon after began collaborations with Eno and producer Tony Visconti.[19] In 1976, Bowie cowrote and produced Pop's solo album debut, The Idiot (1977).[20] As work on the album started before Bowie's own Low, Pop's The Idiot is often referred to as the unofficial beginning of Bowie's Berlin period, though the two albums were recorded almost concurrently.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album Low (1977) was recorded as Bowie grappled with difficult personal issues, including a troubled marriage and drug dependence: \\"There's oodles of pain in the Low album. That was my first attempt to kick cocaine, so that was an awful lot of pain. And I moved to Berlin to do it. I moved out of the coke centre of the world [i.e., Los Angeles] into the smack centre of the world. Thankfully, I didn't have a feeling for smack, so it wasn't a threat\\".[23] Visconti contended that the title was partly a reference to Bowie's \\"low\\" moods during the album's writing and recording.[24] The album marked a movement for Bowie into electronic[25] and ambient music.[26] Side one of the album contained short, direct avant-pop song-fragments;[27] side two comprised longer, mostly instrumental tracks.[27] Often incorrectly given credit as Low's producer,[28] Eno was responsible for a good deal of the direction and composition of the second side of the album and wrote the theme and instrumentation for \\"Warszawa\\" while Bowie was in Paris attending court hearings against his former manager.[29] Partly influenced by the Krautrock sound of Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk and Neu!, Low evinced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional.[18][30] [15]\\r\\n\\r\\nLow and The Idiot were mostly recorded in France, and of Bowie's trilogy only Low and \\"Heroes\\" were recorded at Hansa Studios in Berlin, nicknamed \\"Hansa by the Wall\\" for its proximity to the imposing structure that divided West from East Berlin.[4] Although he completed the album in November 1976, it took his unsettled record company another three months to release it.[31] It received considerable negative criticism upon its releasea release which RCA, anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum, did not welcome, and which Bowie's ex-manager, Tony Defries, who still maintained a significant financial interest in the singer's affairs, tried to prevent. Despite these forebodings, Low yielded the UK number three single \\"Sound and Vision\\", and its own performance surpassed that of Station to Station in the UK chart, where it reached number two.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEchoing Low's minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, \\"Heroes\\" (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by frequent Eno collaborator and King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp. Like Low, \\"Heroes\\" evinced the zeitgeist of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city of Berlin.[32] Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and koto, the album was another hit, reaching number three in the UK. Its title track, though only reaching number 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French.[33] Referencing the burgeoning new wave music scene, RCA Records marketed \\"Heroes\\" with the slogan \\"There's Old Wave. There's New Wave. And there's David Bowie?...\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter releasing \\"Heroes\\" in 1977, Bowie spent much of 1978 on the Isolar II world tour, bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was \\"Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage.?... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends.\\"[34] Recordings from the tour made up the live album Stage, released the same year.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was around the time of Lodger (1979) that Bowie began framing his previous two albums as the beginning of a Berlin-centered trilogy concluding with Lodger, largely as a marketing technique to support the unusual new album.[36] Lodger, the final piece in what Bowie called his \\"triptych\\", eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of the other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. Recorded in Switzerland and New York, the result was a mixture of new wave and world music, in places incorporating Hijaz non-Western scales. Some tracks were composed using Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies cards: \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" entailed band members swapping instruments, \\"Move On\\" used the chords from Bowie's early composition \\"All the Young Dudes\\" played backwards, and \\"Red Money\\" took backing tracks from \\"Sister Midnight\\", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop.[37] The album was recorded in Switzerland. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, \\"It would be fair to call it Bowie's Sergeant Pepper?... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLodger initially received mixed reviews, and as described by biographer Christopher Sandford, \\"The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the endfor fifteen yearsof Bowie's partnership with Eno.\\" Lodger reached number 4 in the UK and number 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" (number 7 in the UK) and \\r\\n\\"DJ\\".[38][39] Towards the end of the year, Bowie and his wife Angela initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.[40] By the early 1980s, Bowie would decamp to New York City.[4]","input":"What albums did david bowie record in berlin?"},{"output":"November 27, 1966","context":"The highest score in a National Football League (NFL) game occurred on November 27, 1966, when the Washington Redskins and New York Giants combined for 113 points in a 72ÿ41 victory for the Redskins.

The Surgeon General also has many informal duties, such as educating the American public about health issues and advocating healthy lifestyle choices.\\r\\nThe office also periodically issues health warnings. Perhaps the best known example of this is the Surgeon General's warning label that has been present on all packages of American tobacco cigarettes since 1966.[5] A similar health warning has appeared on alcoholic beverages labels since 1988.[6]\\r\\nIn 1798, Congress established the Marine Hospital Fund, a network of hospitals that cared for sick and disabled seamen. The Marine Hospital Fund was reorganized along military lines in 1870 and became the Marine Hospital Servicepredecessor to todays United States Public Health Service.

Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods.[2][3] Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz built his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars that were accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.\\r\\nCars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort and safety, and controlling a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. Examples include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. This causes air pollution and also contributes to climate change and global warming.[4] Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, began to become commercially available in 2008.\\r\\nThere are costs and benefits to car use. The costs include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.[5] The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Road traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[6]\\r\\nThe benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.[7] The societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the taxes. The ability for people to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[8] It was estimated in 2014 that the number of cars was over 1.25 billion vehicles,[9] up from the 500 million of 1986.[10] The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other newly industrialized countries.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word car is believed to originate from the Latin word carrus or carrum (\\"wheeled vehicle\\"), or the Middle English word carre (meaning \\"two-wheel cart\\", from Old North French). In turn, these originated from the Gaulish word karros (a Gallic chariot).[12][13] It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.[14][15] \\"Motor car\\" is attested from 1895, and is the usual formal name for cars in British English.[3] \\"Autocar\\" is a variant that is also attested from 1895, but that is now considered archaic. It literally means \\"self-propelled car\\".[16] The term \\"horseless carriage\\" was used by some to refer to the first cars at the time that they were being built, and is attested from 1895.[17]\\r\\nThe word \\"automobile\\" is a classical compound derived from the Ancient Greek word aut܇s (ϫ???), meaning \\"self\\", and the Latin word mobilis, meaning \\"movable\\". It entered the English language from French, and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897.[18] Over time, the word \\"automobile\\" fell out of favour in Britain, and was replaced by \\"motor car\\". \\"Automobile\\" remains chiefly North American, particularly as a formal or commercial term.[19] An abbreviated form, \\"auto\\", was formerly a common way to refer to cars in English, but is now considered old-fashioned. The word is still very common as an adjective in American English, usually in compound formations like \\"auto industry\\" and \\"auto mechanic\\".[20][21] In Dutch and German, two languages historically related to English, the abbreviated form \\"auto\\" (Dutch) / \\"Auto\\" (German), as well as the formal full version \\"automobiel\\" (Dutch) / \\"Automobil\\" (German) are still used  in either the short form is the most regular word for \\"car\\".\\r\\nThe first working steam-powered vehicle was designed  and quite possibly built  by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-cm-long scale-model toy for the Chinese Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.[7][22][23] It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or ran.[23]\\r\\nNicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle or car in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.[24] He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.[25] His inventions were, however, handicapped by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.[25] In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods, and was of little practical use.\\r\\nThe development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the history of the car, but often treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. Sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.\\r\\nIn 1807, Nicphore Nipce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyrolophore), but they chose to install it in a boat on the river Saone in France.[26] Coincidentally, in 1807 the Swiss inventor Fran?ois Isaac de Rivaz designed his own 'de Rivaz internal combustion engine' and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Nipces' Pyrolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.[26] Neither design was very successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile, who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.[1]\\r\\nIn November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouv demonstrated the first working (three-wheeled) car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris.[27] Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were working on the problem at about the same time, Karl Benz generally is acknowledged as the inventor of the modern car.[1]\\r\\nIn 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a model intended for affordability. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888 Bertha Benz, the wife of Karl Benz, undertook the first road trip by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband's invention.\\r\\nIn 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called boxermotor. During the last years of the nineteenth century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a joint-stock company. The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world, was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897, the Pr?sident automobil.\\r\\nDaimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name Daimler. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895 about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other's early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35?hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\\r\\nKarl Benz proposed co-operation between DMG and Benz & Cie. when economic conditions began to deteriorate in Germany following the First World War, but the directors of DMG refused to consider it initially. Negotiations between the two companies resumed several years later when these conditions worsened and, in 1924 they signed an Agreement of Mutual Interest, valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, and sales and they advertised or marketed their car models jointly, although keeping their respective brands. On 28 June 1926, Benz & Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its cars Mercedes Benz, as a brand honoring the most important model of the DMG cars, the Maybach design later referred to as the 1902 Mercedes-35?hp, along with the Benz name. Karl Benz remained a member of the board of directors of Daimler-Benz until his death in 1929, and at times his two sons also participated in the management of the company.\\r\\nIn 1890, mile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France. In 1891, Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a gasoline-powered vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2,100?km (1,300 miles) from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first ParisÿBrestÿParis bicycle race, but finished 6 days after the winning cyclist, Charles Terront.\\r\\nThe first design for an American car with a gasoline internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester, New York. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of sixteen years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, Selden was granted a United States patent (U.S. Patent 549,160) for a two-stroke car engine, which hindered, more than encouraged, development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others, and overturned in 1911.\\r\\nIn 1893, the first running, gasoline-powered American car was built and road-tested by the Duryea brothers of Springfield, Massachusetts. The first public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon took place on 21 September 1893, on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield.[28][29] The Studebaker Automobile Company, subsidiary of a long-established wagon and coach manufacturer, started to build cars in 1897[30]:p.66 and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 and gasoline vehicles in 1904.[31]\\r\\nIn Britain, there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success, with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860.[32] Santler from Malvern is recognized by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first gasoline-powered car in the country in 1894,[33] followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895, but these were both one-offs.[33] The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Company, a company founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896, after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines. Lawson's company made its first car in 1897, and they bore the name Daimler.[33]\\r\\nIn 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a \\"New Rational Combustion Engine\\". In 1897, he built the first diesel engine.[1] Steam-, electric-, and gasoline-powered vehicles competed for decades, with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only Mazda's version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success.\\r\\nAll in all, it is estimated that over 100,000 patents created the modern automobile and motorcycle.[34]\\r\\nLarge-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the U.S. by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts.[35] This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world's first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.\\r\\nAs a result, Ford's cars came off the line in fifteen-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower (from 12.5-man-hours to 1 hour 33 minutes).[36] It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan Black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1913, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford's apocryphal remark, \\"any color as long as it's black\\".[36] In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.[36]\\r\\nFord's complex safety proceduresespecially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam aboutdramatically reduced the rate of injury. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \\"Fordism,\\" and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\\r\\nIn the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citroen was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.[36]\\r\\nDevelopment of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910ÿ1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.\\r\\nSince the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \\"move up\\" as their fortunes improved.\\r\\nReflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.[36]\\r\\nIn Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford's practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41% of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra, had gone under. Citroen did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault's 10CV and Peugeot's 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete.[36] Germany's first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at Russelsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5% of the market.[36]\\r\\nIn Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companines were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three-wheeled for commercial uses, like Daihatsu, or were the result of partnering with European companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda's decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries, as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation.\\r\\nMost cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the deflagration (rather than detonation) combustion of hydrocarbon fossil fuels, mostly gasoline (petrol) and diesel, as well as some Autogas and CNG. Hydrocarbon fuels cause air pollution and contribute to climate change and global warming.[4] Rapidly increasing oil prices, concerns about oil dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. Efforts to improve or replace existing technologies include the development of hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries. Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use.\\r\\nOil consumption in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has been abundantly pushed by car growth; the 1985ÿ2003 oil glut even fuelled the sales of low-economy vehicles in OECD countries. The BRIC countries are adding to this consumption; in December 2009 China was briefly the largest car market.[37]\\r\\nCars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 2000s-era cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.\\r\\nSince the car was first invented, its controls have become fewer and simpler through automation. For example, all cars once had a manual controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. Examples include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knob and switches for secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW's iDrive and Ford's MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the 2010s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.\\r\\nCars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.\\r\\nIn the United States, \\"from 1975 to 1980, average [car] weight dropped from 1,842 to 1,464?kg (4,060 to 3,228?lb), likely in response to rising gasoline prices\\" and new fuel efficiency standards.[39] The average new car weighed 1,461?kg (3,221?lb) in 1987 but 1,818?kg (4,009?lb) in 2010, due to modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and \\"more-powerfulif more-efficientengines.\\"[40] Heavier cars are safer for the driver, from an accident perspective, but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users.[40] The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance, with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance. The SmartFortwo, a small city car, weighs 750ÿ795?kg (1,655ÿ1,755?lb). Heavier cars include full-size cars, SUVs and extended-length SUVs like the Suburban.\\r\\nAccording to research conducted by Julian Allwood of the University of Cambridge, global energy use could be heavily reduced by using lighter cars, and an average weight of 500?kg (1,100?lb) has been said to be well achievable.[41] In some competitions such as the Shell Eco Marathon, average car weights of 45?kg (99?lb) have also been achieved.[42][43] These cars are only single-seaters (still falling within the definition of a car, although 4-seater cars are more common), but they nevertheless demonstrate the amount by which car weights could still be reduced, and the subsequent lower fuel use (i.e. up to a fuel use of 2560?km/l).[44]\\r\\nMost cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats. Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, and minivan.\\r\\nRoad traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[6] Mary Ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown, Ireland,[45] and Henry Bliss one of the United States' first pedestrian car casualties in 1899 in New York City.[46] There are now standard tests for safety in new cars, such as the EuroNCAP and the US NCAP tests,[47] and insurance-industry-backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).[48]\\r\\nWorldwide, road traffic is becoming ever safer, in part due to efforts by the government to implement safety features in cars (e.g., seat belts, air bags, etc.), reduce unsafe driving practices (e.g., speeding, drinking and driving and texting and driving) and make road design more safe by adding features such as speed bumps, which reduce vehicle speed, and roundabouts, which reduce the likelihood of a head-on-collision (as compared with an intersection).\\r\\nThe costs of car usage, which may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance,[5] are weighed against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of the benefits?ÿ perceived and real?ÿ of vehicle usage. The benefits may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence and convenience.[7] During the 1920s, cars had another benefit: \\"[c]ouples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates, plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night.\\"[50]\\r\\nSimilarly the costs to society of encompassing car use, which may include those of: maintaining roads, land use, air pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life, can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. The societal benefits may include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of car production and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability for humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[8]\\r\\nWhile there are different types of fuel that may power cars, most rely on gasoline or diesel. The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that the average vehicle emits 8,887 grams of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) per gallon of gasoline. The average vehicle running on diesel fuel will emit 10,180 grams of carbon dioxide.[51] Many governments are using fiscal policies (such as road tax or the US gas guzzler tax) to influence vehicle purchase decisions, with a low CO2 figure often resulting in reduced taxation.[52] Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g. hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels. High fuel taxes may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, or to not drive. On average, today's cars are about 75 percent recyclable, and using recycled steel helps reduce energy use and pollution.[53] In the United States Congress, federally mandated fuel efficiency standards have been debated regularly, passenger car standards have not risen above the 27.5 miles per US gallon (8.6?L/100?km; 33.0?mpg?imp) standard set in 1985. Light truck standards have changed more frequently, and were set at 22.2 miles per US gallon (10.6?L/100?km; 26.7?mpg?imp) in 2007.[54]\\r\\nThe manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive, and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories, including energy usage, waste and water consumption.[55]\\r\\nThe growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl, therefore encouraging more travel by car resulting in inactivity and obesity, which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases.[56]\\r\\nTransportation (of all types including trucks, buses and cars) is a major contributor to air pollution in most industrialised nations. According to the American Surface Transportation Policy Project nearly half of all Americans are breathing unhealthy air. Their study showed air quality in dozens of metropolitan areas has worsened over the last decade.[57]\\r\\nAnimals and plants are often negatively impacted by cars via habitat destruction and pollution. Over the lifetime of the average car the \\"loss of habitat potential\\" may be over 50,000?m2 (540,000?sq?ft) based on primary production correlations.[58] Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars, referred to as roadkill. More recent road developments are including significant environmental mitigations in their designs such as green bridges to allow wildlife crossings, and creating wildlife corridors.\\r\\nGrowth in the popularity of vehicles and commuting has led to traffic congestion. Brussels was considered Europe's most congested city in 2011 according to TomTom.[59]\\r\\nCar propulsion technologies that are under development include gasoline/electric and plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, hydrogen cars, biofuels, and various alternative fuels. Research into future alternative forms of power include the development of fuel cells, Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), stirling engines,[60] and even using the stored energy of compressed air or liquid nitrogen.\\r\\nNew materials which may replace steel car bodies include duralumin, fiberglass, carbon fiber, biocomposites, and carbon nanotubes. Telematics technology is allowing more and more people to share cars, on a pay-as-you-go basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems.[61]\\r\\nFully autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), and are expected to be commercially available around 2020. According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehiclesin conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasurecould reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades.[62] This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular needa bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short trip down the street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.[63][64]\\r\\nThere have been several projects aiming to develop a car on the principles of open design, an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared, often without monetary compensation. The projects include OScar, Riversimple (through 40fires.org)[65] and c,mm,n.[66] None of the projects have reached significant success in terms of developing a car as a whole both from hardware and software perspective and no mass production ready open-source based design have been introduced as of late 2009. Some car hacking through on-board diagnostics (OBD) has been done so far.[67]\\r\\nCar-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular, in the US and Europe.[68] For example, in the US, some car-sharing services have experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and 2007. Services like car sharing offering a residents to \\"share\\" a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighborhoods.[69]\\r\\nThe automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells the world's motor vehicles. In 2008, more than 70 million motor vehicles, including cars and commercial vehicles were produced worldwide.[70]\\r\\nIn 2007, a total of 71.9 million new cars were sold worldwide: 22.9 million in Europe, 21.4 million in the Asia-Pacific Region, 19.4 million in the USA and Canada, 4.4 million in Latin America, 2.4 million in the Middle East and 1.4 million in Africa.[71] The markets in North America and Japan were stagnant, while those in South America and other parts of Asia grew strongly. Of the major markets, China, Russia, Brazil and India saw the most rapid growth.\\r\\nAbout 250 million vehicles are in use in the United States. Around the world, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road in 2007; they burn over 260?billion US gallons (980,000,000?m3) of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China and India.[11] In the opinion of some, urban transport systems based around the car have proved unsustainable, consuming excessive energy, affecting the health of populations, and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investments. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars.[72][73][74] The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems.\\r\\nIn 2008, with rapidly rising oil prices, industries such as the automotive industry, are experiencing a combination of pricing pressures from raw material costs and changes in consumer buying habits. The industry is also facing increasing external competition from the public transport sector, as consumers re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.[75] Roughly half of the US's fifty-one light vehicle plants are projected to permanently close in the coming years, with the loss of another 200,000 jobs in the sector, on top of the 560,000 jobs lost this decade.[76] Combined with robust growth in China, in 2009, this resulted in China becoming the largest car producer and market in the world. China 2009 sales had increased to 13.6 million, a significant increase from one million of domestic car sales in 2000.[77] Since then however, even in China and other BRIC countries, the automotive production is again falling.[78]\\r\\nEstablished alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transit such as buses, trolleybuses, trains, subways, tramways light rail, cycling, and walking. Bike-share systems have been tried in some European cities, including Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programs have been experimented with in a number of US Cities.[80] Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted.[81]\\r\\nThe term motorcar has formerly also been used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage.

It may be full-time, or on-demand, and is typically linked via a transfer case which provides an additional output drive-shaft, along with additional gear ranges.\\r\\nWhen a four-wheeled vehicle has torque supplied to both axles, this is described as \\"all-wheel drive\\" (AWD). However, \\"four-wheel drive\\" typically refers to a set of specific components and functions, and/or intended offroad application, which generally complies with modern use of the terminology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4G4/4WD/AWD systems were developed in many different markets and used in many different vehicle platforms. There is no universally accepted set of terminology to describe the various architectures and functions.[1] The terms used by various manufacturers often reflect marketing rather than engineering considerations or significant technical differences between systems.[2][3] SAE International's standard J1952 recommends only the term All-Wheel-Drive with additional sub classifications which cover all types of AWD/4WD/4x4 systems found on production vehicles.[4]\\r\\nFour-by-four (4G4) refers to the general class of vehicles. The first figure represents the total wheels (more precisely, axle ends), and the second, the number that are powered. Syntactically, 4G2 means a four-wheel vehicle that transmits engine torque to only two axle-ends: the front two in front-wheel drive or the rear two in rear-wheel drive.[5] Alternatively, a 6G4 vehicle has three axles, two of which provide torque to two wheel ends each.\\r\\nFour wheel drive (4WD) refers to vehicles with two axles providing torque to four wheel ends. In the North American market the term generally refers to a system that is optimized for off-road driving conditions.[6] The term \\"4WD\\" is typically designated for vehicles equipped with a transfercase which switches between 2WD and 4WD operating modes, either manually or automatically.[7]\\r\\nAll wheel drive (AWD) historically was synonymous with \\"four-wheel drive\\" on four-wheeled vehicles, and six-wheel drive on 6G6s, and so on, being used in that fashion at least as early as the 1920s.[8][9] Today in North America the term is applied to both heavy vehicles as well as light passenger vehicles. When referring to heavy vehicles the term is increasingly applied to mean \\"permanent multiple-wheel drive\\" on 2G2, 4G4, 6G6 or 8G8 drive train systems that include a differential between the front and rear drive shafts.[10] This is often coupled with some sort of anti-slip technology, increasingly hydraulic-based, that allows differentials to spin at different speeds but still be capable of transferring torque from a wheel with poor traction to one with better. Typical AWD systems work well on all surfaces, but are not intended for more extreme off-road use.[10] When used to describe AWD systems in light passenger vehicles, it refers to a system that applies torque to all four wheels (permanently or on demand) and/or is targeted at improving on-road traction and performance (particularly in inclement conditions), rather than for off-road applications.[6]\\r\\nSome all wheel drive electric vehicles solve this challenge using one motor for each axle, thereby eliminating a mechanical differential between the front and rear axles. An example of this is the dual motor variant of the Tesla Model S, which on a millisecond scale can control the torque distribution electronically between its two motors.[11]\\r\\nIndividual-wheel drive (IWD) was coined to identify those electric vehicles whereby each wheel is driven by its own individual electric motor. This system essentially has inherent characteristics that would be generally attributed to four-wheel drive systems like the distribution of the available torque to the wheels. However, because of the inherent characteristics of electric motors, torque can be negative, as seen in the Rimac Concept One and SLS AMG Electric. This can have drastic effects, as in better handling in tight corners.[12]\\r\\nThe term IWD can refer to a vehicle with any number of wheels. For example, the Mars rovers are 6-wheel IWD.\\r\\nPer the SAE International standard J1952 AWD is the preferred term for all the systems described above. The standard subdivides AWD systems into three categories.[4]\\r\\nPart-Time AWD systems require driver intervention to couple and decouple the secondary axle from the primarily driven axle and these systems do not have a center differential (or similar device). The definition notes that part-time systems may have a low range.\\r\\nFull-Time AWD systems drive both front and rear axles at all times via a center (inter-axle) differential. The torque split of that differential may be fix or variable depending on the type of center differential. This system can be used on any surface at any speed. The definition does not address inclusion or exclusion of a low range gear.\\r\\nOn-Demand AWD systems drive the secondary axle via an active or passive coupling device or \\"by an independently powered drive system\\". The standard notes that in some cases the secondary drive system may also provide the primary vehicle propulsion. On-demand systems function primarily with only one powered axle until torque is required by the second axle. At that point either a passive or active coupling sends torque to the secondary axle.\\r\\nIn addition to the above primary classifications the J1952 standard notes secondary classifications resulting in a total of eight system designations:\\r\\nTwo wheels fixed to the same axle turn at the same speed as a vehicle goes around curves. This either forces one to slip, if possible, to balance the apparent distance covered, or creates uncomfortable and mechanically stressful wheel hop. To prevent this the wheels are allowed to turn at different speeds using a mechanical or hydraulic differential. This allows one driveshaft to independently drive two output shafts, axles that go from the differential to the wheel, at different speeds.\\r\\nThe differential does this by distributing angular force (in the form of torque) evenly, while distributing angular velocity (turning speed) such that the average for the two output shafts is equal to that of the differential ring gear. When powered each axle requires a differential to distribute power between the left and right sides. When power is distributed to all four wheels a third or 'center' differential can be used to distribute power between the front and rear axles.\\r\\nThe described system handles extremely well, as it is able to accommodate various forces of movement and distribute power evenly and smoothly, making slippage unlikely. Once it does slip, however, recovery is difficult. If the left front wheel of a 4WD vehicle slips on an icy patch of road, for instance, the slipping wheel will spin faster than the other wheels due to the lower traction at that wheel. Since a differential applies equal torque to each half-shaft, power is reduced at the other wheels, even if they have good traction. This problem can happen in both 2WD and 4WD vehicles, whenever a driven wheel is placed on a surface with little traction or raised off the ground. The simplistic design works acceptably well for 2WD vehicles. It is much less acceptable for 4WD vehicles, because 4WD vehicles have twice as many wheels with which to lose traction, increasing the likelihood that it may happen. 4WD vehicles may also be more likely to drive on surfaces with reduced traction. However, since torque is divided amongst four wheels rather than two, each wheel receives approximately half the torque of a 2WD vehicle, reducing the potential for wheel slip.\\r\\nMany differentials have no way of limiting the amount of engine power that gets sent to its attached output shafts. As a result, if a tire loses traction on acceleration, either because of a low-traction situation (e.g., - driving on gravel or ice) or the engine power overcomes available traction, the tire that is not slipping receives little or no power from the engine. In very low traction situations, this can prevent the vehicle from moving at all. To overcome this, there are several designs of differentials that can either limit the amount of slip (these are called 'limited-slip' differentials) or temporarily lock the two output shafts together to ensure that engine power reaches all driven wheels equally.\\r\\nLocking differentials work by temporarily locking together a differential's output shafts, causing all wheels to turn at the same rate, providing torque in case of slippage. This is generally used for the center differential, which distributes power between the front and the rear axles. While a drivetrain that turns all wheels equally would normally fight the driver and cause handling problems, this is not a concern when wheels are slipping.\\r\\nThe two most common factory-installed locking differentials use either a computer-controlled multi-plate clutch or viscous coupling unit to join the shafts, while other differentials more commonly used on off-road vehicles generally use manually operated locking devices. In the multi-plate clutch the vehicle's computer senses slippage and locks the shafts, causing a small jolt when it activates, which can disturb the driver or cause additional traction loss. In the viscous coupling differentials the shear stress of high shaft speed differences causes a dilatant fluid in the differential to become solid, linking the two shafts. This design suffers from fluid degradation with age and from exponential locking behavior.[citation needed] Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer.\\r\\nA third approach to limiting slippage is taken by a Torsen differential. A Torsen differential allows the output shafts to receive different amounts of torque. This design does not provide for traction when one wheel is spinning freely, where there is no torque, but provides excellent handling in less extreme situations.[citation needed] A typical Torsen II differential can deliver up to twice as much torque to the high traction side before traction is exceeded at the lower traction side.\\r\\nA fairly recent innovation in automobiles is electronic traction control. Traction control typically uses a vehicle's braking system to slow a spinning wheel. This forced slowing emulates the function of a limited-slip differential, and, by using the brakes more aggressively to ensure wheels are being driven at the same speed, can also emulate a locking differential. It should be noted that this technique normally requires wheel sensors to detect when a wheel is slipping, and only activates when wheel slip is detected. Therefore, there is typically no mechanism to actively prevent wheel slip (i.e., you can't \\"lock the differential\\" in advance of wheel slip), rather the system is designed to expressly permit wheel slip to occur, and then attempt to send torque to the wheels with the best traction. If preventing all-wheel slip is a requirement, this is a limiting design.\\r\\nThe architecture of an AWD/4WD system can be described by describing its possible operating modes.[1] A single vehicle may have the ability to operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection. Mohan describes the modes as follows:\\r\\nTwo Wheel Drive (2WD) Mode - In this mode only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven. The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The operating torque split ratio is 0:100.\\r\\nFour Wheel Drive (4WD) Mode - Here, depending on the nature of torque transfer to the axles, we can define three sub-modes (below).\\r\\nIn 1893, before the establishment of a modern automotive industry in Britain, English engineer Bramah Joseph Diplock patented a four-wheel-drive system for a steam-powered traction engine,[13] including four-wheel steering and three differentials, which was subsequently built. The development also incorporated Bramah's Pedrail wheel system in what was one of the first four-wheel-drive automobiles to display an intentional ability to travel on challenging road surfaces. It stemmed from Bramagh's previous idea of developing an engine that would reduce the amount of damage to public roads.\\r\\nFerdinand Porsche designed and built a four-wheel-driven electric vehicle for the k. u. k. Hofwagenfabrik Ludwig Lohner & Co. in Vienna in 1899, presented to the public during the 1900 World Exhibition in Paris. The vehicle was a series hybrid car, that used an electric hub motor at each wheel, powered by batteries, which were in turn charged by a gasoline-engine generator.[14][15] It was clumsily heavy and due to its unusual status the so-called Lohner-Porsche is not frequently given its credit as the first four-wheel-driven automobile.\\r\\nThe world's first four-wheel-drive car directly powered by an internal combustion engine, commissioned for the Paris to Madrid race of 1903, the Spyker 60 H.P., was presented that year by Dutch brothers Jacobus and Hendrik-Jan Spijker of Amsterdam.[16][17] The two-seat sports car featured permanent four-wheel drive and was also the first car ever equipped with a six-cylinder engine, as well as four-wheel braking. Later used as a hill-climb racer, it is now an exhibit in the Louwman Museum (the former Nationaal Automobiel Museum) in the Hague, the Netherlands.[18]\\r\\nDesigns for four-wheel drive in America came from the Twyford Company of Brookville, Pennsylvania in 1905, six were made there around 1906; one still exists and is displayed annually.[19] The second American four-wheel-drive vehicle was built in 1908 by (what became) the Four Wheel Drive Auto Company (FWD) of Wisconsin (not to be confused with the term \\"FWD\\" as an acronym for front-wheel drive). FWD would later produce around 15,000 of its four-wheel-drive Model B trucks for the British and American armies during World War I.[20] Approximately 11,500 of the Jeffery or Nash Quad models (1913ÿ1919) were similarly used. The Quad not only came with four-wheel drive and four-wheel brakes, but also featured four-wheel steering.[20]\\r\\nThe Reynolds-Alberta Museum has a four-wheel-drive vehicle, named \\"Michigan\\", from 1905 in an unrestored storage. The American Marmon-Herrington Company was founded in 1931 to serve a growing market for moderately priced four-wheel-drive vehicles. Marmon-Herrington specialized in converting Ford trucks to four-wheel drive and got off to a successful start by procuring contracts for military aircraft refueling trucks, 4G4 chassis for towing light weaponry,[21] commercial aircraft refueling trucks, and an order from the Iraqi Pipeline Company for what were the largest trucks ever built at the time.\\r\\nDaimler-Benz also has a history in four-wheel drive. In 1907 the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft had built a four-wheel-driven vehicle called Dernburg-Wagen, also equipped with four-wheel steering, that was used by German colonial civil servant, Bernhard Dernburg, in Namibia. Mercedes and BMW, in 1926, introduced a rather sophisticated four-wheel drive, the G1, the G4 and G4 following. The 1937 Mercedes-Benz G5 and BMW 325 4G4 featured full-time four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, three locking differentials, and fully independent suspension. They were produced because of a government demand for a four-wheel-drive passenger vehicle. The modern G-series/Wolf such as the G500 and G55 AMG still feature some of the attributes, with the exception of fully independent suspension since it can compromise ground clearance. The Unimog is another Mercedes truck.\\r\\nStarting in 1936, Japanese company Tokyu Kurogane Kogyo built approximately 4,700 four-wheel-drive roadsters, called the Kurogane Type 95 reconnaissance car, used by the Imperial Japanese Army from 1937 until 1944, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Three different bodystyles were manufactured; a 2-door roadster, a 2-door pickup truck and a 4-door phaeton, all equipped with a transfer case that engaged the front wheels, powered by a 1.3 litre, 2-cylinder, air-cooled OHV V-twin engine.[22]\\r\\nThe first Russian produced four-wheel-drive vehicle, also in part for civilian use, was the GAZ-61, developed in the Soviet Union in 1938. \\"Civilian use\\" may be a bit of a misnomer, as most if not all were used by the Soviet government and military (as command cars), but the GAZ-61-73 version is the first four-wheel drive vehicle with a normal closed sedan body. Elements of the chassis were used in subsequent military vehicles such as the 1940 GAZ-64 and the 1943 GAZ-67, as well as the post-war GAZ-69, and the properly civilian GAZ-M-72, based on the rear-wheel drive GAZ-20 \\"Victory\\" and built from 1955-1958. Soviet civilian life did not allow the proliferation of civilian products such as the Jeep in North America, but through the 1960s the technology of Soviet 4G4 vehicles stayed on par with British, German, and American models, even exceeding it in some aspects, and for military purposes just as actively developed, produced and used.\\r\\nIt was not until \\"go-anywhere\\" vehicles were needed for the military on a large scale, that four-wheel drive found its place. The World War II Jeep, originally developed by American Bantam but mass-produced by Willys and Ford, became the best-known four-wheel-drive vehicle in the world during the war.[23]\\r\\nWillys introduced the model CJ-2A in 1945, the first full-production four-wheel-drive vehicle for sale in the general marketplace. Thanks to the ubiquitous World War II jeep's success, its rugged utilitarianism set the pattern for many four-wheel drive vehicles to come.[24]\\r\\nThe similarly boxy, also inline-4 powered Land Rover appeared at the Amsterdam Motor Show in 1948. Originally conceived as a stop-gap product for the struggling Rover car company, despite chronic under-investment it succeeded far better than the passenger cars. Inspired by a Willys MB that was frequently run off-road on the farm belonging to chief engineer Maurice Wilks, Land Rover developed the more refined yet still off-road capable luxury 4WD Range Rover in the 1970s.\\r\\nWith the acquisition of the \\"Jeep\\" name in 1950 Willys had cornered the brand. Its successor, Kaiser Jeep, introduced a revolutionary 4WD wagon called the Wagoneer in 1963. Not only was it technically innovative, with independent front suspension and the first automatic transmission coupled to 4WD, it was equipped and finished as a regular passenger automobile.[25] In effect, it was the ancestor of the modern SUV. The luxury Rambler or Buick V8s powered Super Wagoneer produced from 1966 to 1969 raised the bar even higher.\\r\\nJensen applied the Formula Ferguson (FF) full-time all-wheel-drive system to 318 units of their Jensen FF built from 1966 to 1971, marking the first time 4WD was used in a production GT sports car.[26] While most 4WD systems split torque evenly, the Jensen split torque roughly 40% front, 60% rear by gearing the front and rear at different ratios.\\r\\nAmerican Motors (AMC) acquired Kaiser's Jeep Division in 1970 and quickly upgraded and expanded the entire line of off-road 4WD vehicles. With its added roadworthiness, the top range full-size Grand Wagoneer continued to compete with traditional luxury cars.[27] Partially hand-built, it was relatively unchanged during its production through 1991, even after Chrysler's buyout of AMC.\\r\\nSubaru introduced the category-expanding Leone in 1972, an inexpensive compact station wagon with a light-duty, part-time four-wheel drive system that could not be engaged on dry pavement. In September AMC introduced Quadra Trac full-time AWD for the 1973 model year Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer.[28] Thanks to full-time AWD, which relieved the driver of getting out to lock hubs and having to manually select between 2WD and 4WD modes, it dominated all other makes in FIA rally competition. Gene Henderson and Ken Pogue won the Press-on-Regardless Rally FIA championship with a Quadra Trac equipped Jeep in 1972.[29]\\r\\nAmerican Motors introduced the innovative Eagle for the 1980 model year.[30] These were the first American mass production cars to use the complete front-engine, four-wheel drive system.[31] The AMC Eagle was offered as a sedan, coupe, and station wagon with permanent automatic all-wheel-drive passenger models. The new Eagles combined Jeep technology with an existing and proven AMC passenger automobile platform. They ushered a whole new product category of \\"sport-utility\\" or crossover SUV. AMC's Eagles came with the comfort and high-level appointments expected of regular passenger models and used the off-road technology for an extra margin of safety and traction.[32]\\r\\nThe Eagle's thick viscous fluid center differential provided quiet and smooth transfer of power that was directed proportionally to the axle with the greatest traction. This was a true full-time system operating only in four-wheel drive without undue wear on suspension or driveline components. There was no low range in the transfer case. This became the forerunner of the designs that followed from other manufacturers.[33] The automobile press at the time tested the traction of the Eagles and described it as far superior to the Subaru's and that it could beat many so-called off-road vehicles. Four Wheeler magazine concluded that the AMC Eagle was \\"The beginning of a new generation of cars.\\"[34]\\r\\nThe Eagles were popular (particularly in the snowbelt), had towing capacity, and came in several equipment levels including sport and luxury trims. Two additional models were added in 1981, the sub-compact SX/4 and Kammback. A manual transmission and a front axle-disconnect feature were also made available for greater fuel economy. During 1981 and 1982 a unique convertible was added to the line. The Eagle's monocoque body was reinforced for the conversion and had a steel targa bar with a removable fiberglass roof section.[35] The Eagle station wagon remained in production for one model year after Chrysler acquired AMC in 1987.\\r\\nAudi also introduced a permanently all-wheel-driven road-going car, the Audi Quattro, in 1980. Audi's chassis engineer, J?rg Bensinger, had noticed in winter tests in Scandinavia that a vehicle used by the German Army, the Volkswagen Iltis, could beat any high-performance Audi. He proposed developing a four-wheel-drive car, that would also be used for rallying to improve Audi's conservative image. The Audi Quattro system became a feature on production cars.\\r\\nIn 1987, Toyota also developed a car built for competition in rally campaigns.[36] A limited number of road-going FIA Homologation Special Vehicle Celica GT-Four (known as Toyota Celica All-Trac Turbo in North America) were produced. The All-Trac system was later available on serial production Toyota Camry, Toyota Corolla, and Toyota Previa models.\\r\\nSome of the earliest mid-engined four-wheel-drive cars were the various road-legal rally cars made for Group B homologation, such as the Ford RS200 made from 1984 to 1986. In 1989, niche maker Panther Westwinds created a mid-engined four-wheel-drive, the Panther Solo 2.\\r\\nIn the United States, as of late 2013, AWD vehicles comprised 32 per cent of new light vehicle sales, up five per cent since 2008.[37] This is in large part due to the popularity of the crossover.[37] Most crossovers offer the popular technology, in spite of it increasing vehicle price and fuel consumption.[38] Car manufacturers have inundated consumers with marketing proclaiming AWD as a safety feature, although the advantage of AWD over FWD is in accelerating, not braking or steering.[39] Tests have shown that though AWD gives improved acceleration in wintery conditions, it does not help with braking.[40]\\r\\nIn 2008, Nissan introduced the GT-R featuring a rear-mounted transaxle. The AWD system requires two drive shafts, one main shaft from the engine to the transaxle and differential and a second drive shaft from the transaxle to the front wheels.[41]\\r\\nSpyker is credited with building and racing the first ever four-wheel racing car, the Spyker 60 HP in 1903.[42][17]\\r\\nBugatti created a total of three four-wheel-drive racers, the Type 53, in 1932, but the cars were notorious for having poor handling.\\r\\nMiller produced the first 4WD car to qualify for the Indianapolis 500, the 1938 Miller Gulf Special.\\r\\nFerguson Research Ltd. built the front-engine P99 Formula One car that actually won a non-World Championship race with Stirling Moss in 1961. In 1968, Team Lotus raced cars in the Indy 500 and three years later in Formula 1 with the Lotus 56, that had both turbine engines and 4WD, as well as the 1969 4WD-Lotus 63 that had the standard 3-litre V8 Ford Cosworth engine. Matra also raced a similar MS84, and McLaren entered their M9A in the British Grand Prix, while engine manufacturers Ford-Cosworth produced their own version which was tested but never raced. All these F1 cars were considered inferior to their RWD counterparts, as the advent of aerodynamic downforce meant that adequate traction could be obtained in a lighter and more mechanically efficient manner, and the idea was discontinued, even though Lotus tried repeatedly.\\r\\nNissan and Audi had success with all-wheel drive in road racing with the former's advent of the Nissan Skyline GT-R in 1989. So successful was the car that it dominated the Japanese circuit for the first years of production, going on to bigger and more impressive wins in Australia before weight penalties eventually levied a de facto ban on the car. Most controversially was the win pulled off at the 1990 Macau Grand Prix where the car led from start to finish. Audi's dominance in the Trans-Am Series in 1988 was equally controversial as it led to a weight penalty mid season and to a rule revision banning all-AWD cars, its dominance in Super Touring eventually led to a FIA ban on AWD system in 1998.\\r\\nNew 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans regulations may revive AWD/4WD in road racing, though such systems are only allowed in new hybrid-powered Le Mans Prototypes.[43] One example is the Audi R18 e-tron quattro (winner of 2012 race, the first ever hybrid/4WD to win Le Mans), utilizing an electric motor in the front axle while combining the engine motor in the rear.[44]\\r\\nMedium-duty trucks and Heavy-duty trucks have recently adopted 4G4 drive-trains. 4G4 medium-duty trucks became common after Ford Motor Company began selling Ford Super Duty trucks. The Super Duty trucks shared many parts between the light duty and medium duty, reducing production costs. The Dana 60 front axle is used on both medium- and light-duty Super Duty trucks. Furthermore, the Big Three share/shared parts between the companies reducing costs. The Dana S 110 is currently being used for the rear drive, under Ford and Ram's medium-duty trucks. The Dana 110 was also used on the General Motors 4G4s as well. Ram Trucks began selling medium-duty trucks, 4G4 and 4G2, in 2008. General Motors sold a 4G4 for model years 2005-2009.\\r\\nGM 4G4 medium-duty trucks\\r\\nHeavy duty International Workstar\\r\\nFord medium-duty 4G4 drive train\\r\\nVolvo introduced the Model 646 four-wheel drive backhoe loader in 1977.[45] Case Corporation followed suit in the U.S. in 1987.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn engineering terms, \\"four-wheel drive\\" designates a vehicle with power delivered to four wheel ends spread over at least two axles. The term 4G4 (pronounced four by four) was in use to describe North American military four-wheel-drive vehicles as early as the 1940s,[46] with the first number indicating the number of wheel ends on a vehicle and the second indicating the number of driven wheels.\\r\\nTrucks with dual tires on the rear axle and two driven axles are designated as 4G4s despite having six wheels because the paired rear wheels behave as a single wheel for traction and classification purposes. True 6G6 vehicles which have three powered axles, and are classified as 6G6s regardless of how many wheels they have. Examples of these with two rear, one front axle are the 6-wheeled Pinzgauer, which is popular with defense forces around the globe, and 10-wheeled GMC CCKW made famous by the U.S. Army in World War II.\\r\\n4-wheeler (or four-wheeler) is a related term applying to all-terrain vehicles, and not to be confused with four-wheel drive. The \\"four\\" in the instance referring to the vehicle having four wheels, not necessarily all driven.\\r\\nPrompted by a perceived need for a simple, inexpensive all-terrain vehicle for oil exploration in North Africa, the French motor manufacturer Citro?n developed the 2CV Sahara in 1958. Unlike other 4G4 vehicles which use a conventional transfer case to drive the front and rear axle, the Sahara had two engines, each independently driving a separate axle, with the rear engine facing backwards. The two throttles, clutches and gear change mechanisms could be linked, so the two 12?hp (9?kW) 425?cc (26?cu?in) engines could run together, or they could be split and the car driven solely by either engine. Combined with twin fuel tanks and twin batteries (which could be set up to run either or both engines), the redundancy of two separate drive trains meant that they could make it back to civilization even after major mechanical failures. Only around 700 of these cars were built, and only 27 are known to exist today.[47]\\r\\nBMC experimented with a twin-engine Mini Moke (dubbed the \\"Twini Moke\\") in the mid-1960s, but never put it into production. This made advantage of the Mini's 'power pack' layout, with a transverse engine and the gearbox in the engine sump. Simply by fitting a second engine/gearbox unit across the rear, a rudimentary 4G4 system could be produced. Early prototypes had separate gear levers and clutch systems for each engine. Later versions sent for evaluation by the British Army had more user-friendly linked systems.\\r\\nIn 1965, A. J. M. Chadwick patented a 4WD system, GB 1113068, that used hemispherical wheels for an all-terrain vehicle. Twenty years later, B. T. E. Warne, patented, GB 2172558, an improvement on Chadwick's design that did not use differential gear assemblies. By using near-spherical wheels with provision to tilt and turn each wheel co-ordinatively, the driven wheels maintain constant traction. Furthermore, all driven wheels steer and, as pairing of wheels is not necessary, vehicles with an odd number of wheels are possible without affecting the system's integrity. Progressive deceleration is made possible by dynamically changing the front-to-rear effective wheel diameter ratios.\\r\\nSuzuki Motors introduced the Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Edition in 1996. Earlier Suzuki versions were twin engined, from 1996 on the engine is a twin-turbocharged 2.0?L V6, mated to a sequential 6-speed manual transmission.\\r\\nNissan Motors has developed a system called E-4WD. It is designed for cars that are normally front-wheel drive, however the rear wheels are powered by electric motors. This system was introduced in some variants of the Nissan Cube and Tiida. (This is similar to the system used on the Ford Escape Hybrid AWD.[48])\\r\\nChrysler's Jeep Division debuted the twin engine, 670?hp (500?kW) Jeep Hurricane concept at the 2005 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. This vehicle has a unique \\"crab crawl\\" capability, which allows it to rotate 360 in place. This is accomplished by driving the left wheels as a pair and right wheels as a pair, as opposed to driving the front and rear pairs. A central gearbox allows one side to drive in the opposite direction to the other. It also has dual Hemi V8s.\\r\\nSome hybrid vehicles such as the Lexus RX400h provide power to an AWD system through a pair of electric motors, one to the front wheels and one to the rear. In the case of the AWD model version of the Lexus RX400h (and its Toyota-branded counterpart, the Harrier hybrid), the front wheels can also receive drive power directly from the vehicle's gasoline engine as well as via the electric motors, whereas the rear wheels derive power only from the second electric motor. Transfer of power is managed automatically by internal electronics based on traction conditions and need, making this an all-wheel-drive system.\\r\\nThe 4RM system used in the Ferrari FF in 2011 is unique in that it has a rear transaxle with secondary front transaxle connected directly to the engine. The car operates primarily as a rear wheel drive vehicle. Clutches in the front transaxle engage when the rear wheels slip. Drive to the front wheels is transmitted through two infinitely-variable clutch packs which are allowed to 'slip' to give the required road wheel speeds. The front transaxle has three gears, two forward, and reverse. The two forward gears of the front transmission match the lower four forward gears of the rear transmission. It is not used in higher gears. The connection between this gearbox and each front wheel is via independent haldex-type clutches, without a differential. Due to the difference in ratios the clutches continually slip and only transmit, at most, 20% of the engine's torque.[49]\\r\\nThe above systems ending with \\"#\\" function by selectively using the traction control system (via ABS) to brake a slipping wheel.\\r\\nNote: the above all function like 2WD when multi-plate clutch coupling is not engaged (with exception of Subaru models), and like 4WD highrange in a part-time 4WD system when the clutch is engaged (usually by computer although some allow manual control). Some in this category have varying degrees of control in the torque distribution between front and rear by allowing some of the clutches in a multi-plate clutch coupling to engage and slip varying amounts. An example of a system like this is the BorgWarner i-Trac(TM) system. Note: the Haldex Traction-based car list was created from the list on Haldex Traction corporate web site: Haldex Cars. A version of the BorgWarner ITM3e system is used on 2006 and up Porsche 911TT's. The Borg-Warner ITM 3e is also used in the 2006-now Hyundai Santa Fe and the Hyundai Tucson. In the Hyundais, the ITM 3e acts like a full-time AWD with 95:5 normal torque split. In extreme conditions, the system can be locked in a 50:50 split via the 4WD LOCK button.\\r\\nThese are vehicles that have no center differential. Since there is no center differential to allow for speed differences between the front and rear wheels when turning, a small amount of tire slippage must occur during turns. When used on slick surfaces, this is not a problem, but when turning on dry pavement, the tires grip, then are forced to slip, then grip again, and so on, until the turn is completed. This causes the vehicle to exhibit a 'hopping' sensation. Using an engaged part-time 4WD system on a hard surface is not recommended, as damage to the drive-line eventually occurs.","input":"What was the first mass produced car to come from the factory with all-wheel steering?"},{"output":"Russia","context":"There are eight sovereign states that have successfully detonated nuclear weapons.[1] Five are considered to be \\"nuclear-weapon states\\" (NWS) under the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In order of acquisition of nuclear weapons these are: the United States, the Russian Federation (the successor state to the Soviet Union), the United Kingdom, France, and China.\\r\\nSince the NPT entered into force in 1970, three states that were not parties to the Treaty have conducted nuclear tests, namely India, Pakistan, and North Korea. North Korea had been a party to the NPT but withdrew in 2003. Israel is also widely known to have nuclear weapons,[2][3][4][5][6] though it maintains a policy of deliberate ambiguity regarding this (has not acknowledged it), and is not known definitively to have conducted a nuclear test.[7] According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's SIPRI Yearbook of 2014, Israel has approximately 80 nuclear warheads.[8]\\r\\nAccording to Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Nuclear Notebook, the total number of nuclear weapons worldwide is estimated at 9,920 in 2017.[9]\\r\\nSouth Africa developed nuclear weapons but then disassembled its arsenal before joining the NPT.[10] Nations that are known or thought to have nuclear weapons are sometimes referred to informally as the nuclear club.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of states that have admitted the possession of nuclear weapons or are presumed to possess them, the approximate number of warheads under their control, and the year they tested their first weapon and their force configuration. This list is informally known in global politics as the \\"Nuclear Club\\".[11][12] With the exception of Russia and the United States (which have subjected their nuclear forces to independent verification under various treaties) these figures are estimates, in some cases quite unreliable estimates. In particular, under the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty thousands of Russian and U.S. nuclear warheads are inactive in stockpiles awaiting processing. The fissile material contained in the warheads can then be recycled for use in nuclear reactors.\\r\\nFrom a high of 68,000 active weapons in 1985, as of 2016[update] there are some 4,000 active nuclear warheads and 10,100 total nuclear warheads in the world.[1] Many of the decommissioned weapons were simply stored or partially dismantled, not destroyed.[13]\\r\\nIt is also noteworthy that since the dawn of the Atomic Age, the delivery methods of most states with nuclear weapons has evolved with some achieving a nuclear triad, while others have consolidated away from land and air deterrents to submarine-based forces.\\r\\nThese five states are known to have detonated a nuclear explosive before 1 January 1967 and are thus nuclear weapons states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, they also happen to be the UN Security Council's permanent members with veto power on UNSC resolutions.\\r\\nThe United States developed the first nuclear weapons during World War?II in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada as part of the Manhattan Project, out of the fear that Nazi Germany would develop them first. It tested the first nuclear weapon on July 16, 1945 (\\"Trinity\\") at 5:30 am, and remains the only country to have used nuclear weapons in war, devastating the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was the first nation to develop the hydrogen bomb, testing an experimental prototype in 1952 (\\"Ivy Mike\\") and a deployable weapon in 1954 (\\"Castle Bravo\\"). Throughout the Cold War it continued to modernize and enlarge its nuclear arsenal, but from 1992 on has been involved primarily in a program of Stockpile stewardship.[35][36][37][38] The U.S. nuclear arsenal contained 31,175 warheads at its Cold War height (in 1966).[39] During the Cold War, the United States built approximately 70,000 nuclear warheads, more than all other nuclear-weapon states combined.[40][41]\\r\\nThe Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon (\\"RDS-1\\") in 1949, in a crash project developed partially with espionage obtained during and after World War II. The Soviet Union was the second nation to have developed and tested a nuclear weapon. The direct motivation for Soviet weapons development was to achieve a balance of power during the Cold War. It tested its first megaton-range hydrogen bomb (\\"RDS-37\\") in 1955. The Soviet Union also tested the most powerful explosive ever detonated by humans, (\\"Tsar Bomba\\"), with a theoretical yield of 100 megatons, intentionally reduced to 50 when detonated. After its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet weapons entered officially into the possession of the Russian Federation.[42] The Soviet nuclear arsenal contained some 45,000 warheads at its peak (in 1986); the Soviet Union built about 55,000 nuclear warheads since 1949.[41]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom tested its first nuclear weapon (\\"Hurricane\\") in 1952. The UK had provided considerable impetus and initial research for the early conception of the atomic bomb, aided by the presence of refugee scientists working in British laboratories who had fled the continent. It collaborated closely with the United States and Canada during the Manhattan Project, but had to develop its own method for manufacturing and detonating a bomb as U.S. secrecy grew after 1945. The United Kingdom was the third country in the world, after the United States and Soviet Union, to develop and test a nuclear weapon. Its programme was motivated to have an independent deterrent against the Soviet Union, while also maintaining its status as a great power. It tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1957 (Operation Grapple), making it the third country to do so after the United States and Soviet Union.[43][44] The UK maintained a fleet of V bomber strategic bombers and ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) equipped with nuclear weapons during the Cold War. It currently maintains a fleet of four 'Vanguard' class ballistic missile submarines equipped with Trident II missiles. In 2016, the UK House of Commons voted to renew the British nuclear deterrent with the Dreadnought-class submarine, without setting a date for the commencement of service of a replacement to the current system.\\r\\nFrance tested its first nuclear weapon in 1960 (\\"Gerboise Bleue\\"), based mostly on its own research. It was motivated by the Suez Crisis diplomatic tension vis--vis both the Soviet Union and the Free World allies United States and United Kingdom. It was also relevant to retain great power status, alongside the United Kingdom, during the post-colonial Cold War (see: Force de frappe). France tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1968 (\\"Opration Canopus\\"). After the Cold War, France has disarmed 175 warheads with the reduction and modernization of its arsenal that has now evolved to a dual system based on submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and medium-range air-to-surface missiles (Rafale fighter-bombers). However new nuclear weapons are in development[citation needed] and reformed nuclear squadrons were trained during Enduring Freedom operations in Afghanistan.[citation needed] France signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1992.[45] In January 2006, President Jacques Chirac stated a terrorist act or the use of weapons of mass destruction against France would result in a nuclear counterattack.[46] In February 2015, President Francois Hollande stressed the need for a nuclear deterrent in \\"a dangerous world\\". He also detailed the French deterrent as \\"less than 300\\" nuclear warheads, three sets of 16 submarine-launched ballistic missiles and 54 medium-range air-to-surface missiles\\" and urged other states to show similar transparency.[47]\\r\\nChina tested its first nuclear weapon device (\\"596\\") in 1964 at the Lop Nur test site. The weapon was developed as a deterrent against both the United States and the Soviet Union. Two years later, China had a fission bomb capable of being put onto a nuclear missile. It tested its first hydrogen bomb (\\"Test No. 6\\") in 1967, a mere 32 months after testing its first nuclear weapon (the shortest fission-to-fusion development known in history).[48] The country is currently thought to have had a stockpile of around 240 warheads, though because of the limited information available, estimates range from 100 to 400.[49][50][51] China is the only NPT nuclear-weapon state to give an unqualified negative security assurance due to its \\"no first use\\" policy.[52][53] China signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1992.[45] On February 25, 2015 U.S. Vice Admiral Joseph Mulloy stated to the House Armed Services Committee's seapower subcommittee that the U.S. does not believe the PLAN currently deploys SLBMs on their submarine fleet.[54]\\r\\nIndia is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. India tested what it called a \\"peaceful nuclear explosive\\" in 1974 (which became known as \\"Smiling Buddha\\"). The test was the first test developed after the creation of the NPT, and created new questions about how civilian nuclear technology could be diverted secretly to weapons purposes (dual-use technology). India's secret development caused great concern and anger particularly from nations, such as Canada, that had supplied its nuclear reactors for peaceful and power generating needs.[citation needed]\\r\\nIndian officials rejected the NPT in the 1960s on the grounds that it created a world of nuclear \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots\\", arguing that it unnecessarily restricted \\"peaceful activity\\" (including \\"peaceful nuclear explosives\\"), and that India would not accede to international control of their nuclear facilities unless all other countries engaged in unilateral disarmament of their own nuclear weapons. The Indian position has also asserted that the NPT is in many ways a neo-colonial regime designed to deny security to post-colonial powers.[55] Even after its 1974 test, India maintained that its nuclear capability was primarily \\"peaceful\\", but between 1988 and 1990 it apparently weaponized two dozen nuclear weapons for delivery by air.[56] In 1998 India tested weaponized nuclear warheads (\\"Operation Shakti\\"), including a thermonuclear device.[57]\\r\\nIn July 2005, U.S. President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced plans to conclude an Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement.[58] This came to fruition through a series of steps that included India's announced plan to separate its civil and military nuclear programs in March 2006,[59] the passage of the IndiaÿUnited States Civil Nuclear Agreement by the U.S. Congress in December 2006, the conclusion of a U.S.ÿIndia nuclear cooperation agreement in July 2007,[60] approval by the IAEA of an India-specific safeguards agreement,[61] agreement by the Nuclear Suppliers Group to a waiver of export restrictions for India,[62] approval by the U.S. Congress[63] and culminating in the signature of U.S.ÿIndia agreement for civil nuclear cooperation[64] in October 2008. The U.S. State Department said it made it \\"very clear that we will not recognize India as a nuclear-weapon state\\".[65] The United States is bound by the Hyde Act with India and may cease all cooperation with India if India detonates a nuclear explosive device. The US had further said it is not its intention to assist India in the design, construction or operation of sensitive nuclear technologies through the transfer of dual-use items.[66] In establishing an exemption for India, the Nuclear Suppliers Group reserved the right to consult on any future issues which might trouble it.[67] As of early 2013, India was estimated to have had a stockpile of around 90ÿ110 warheads.[1]\\r\\nPakistan also is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Pakistan covertly developed nuclear weapons over decades, beginning in the late 1970s. Pakistan first delved into nuclear power after the establishment of its first nuclear power plant near Karachi with equipment and materials supplied mainly by western nations in the early 1970s. Pakistani President Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto promised in 1971 that if India could build nuclear weapons then Pakistan would too, according to him: \\"We will develop Nuclear stockpiles, even if we have to eat grass.\\"\\r\\nIt is believed that Pakistan has possessed nuclear weapons since the mid-1980s.[68] The United States continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess such weapons until 1990, when sanctions were imposed under the Pressler Amendment, requiring a cutoff of U.S. economic and military assistance to Pakistan.[69] In 1998, Pakistan conducted its first six nuclear tests at the Ras Koh Hills in response to the five tests conducted by India a few weeks before.\\r\\nIn 2004, the Pakistani metallurgist Abdul Qadeer Khan, a key figure in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, confessed to heading an international black market ring involved in selling nuclear weapons technology. In particular, Khan had been selling gas centrifuge technology to North Korea, Iran, and Libya. Khan denied complicity by the Pakistani government or Army, but this has been called into question by journalists and IAEA officials, and was later contradicted by statements from Khan himself.[70]\\r\\nAs of early 2013, Pakistan was estimated to have had a stockpile of around 100ÿ120 warheads,[1] and in November 2014 it was projected that by 2020 Pakistan would have enough fissile material for 200 warheads.[71]\\r\\nNorth Korea was a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but announced a withdrawal on January 10, 2003, after the United States accused it of having a secret uranium enrichment program and cut off energy assistance under the 1994 Agreed Framework. In February 2005, North Korea claimed to possess functional nuclear weapons, though their lack of a test at the time led many experts to doubt the claim. However, in October 2006, North Korea stated that due to growing intimidation by the United States, it would conduct a nuclear test to confirm its nuclear status. North Korea reported a successful nuclear test on October 9, 2006 (see 2006 North Korean nuclear test). Most U.S. intelligence officials believe that North Korea did, in fact, test a nuclear device due to radioactive isotopes detected by U.S. aircraft; however, most agree that the test was probably only partially successful.[72] The yield may have been less than a kiloton, which is much smaller than the first successful tests of other powers; boosted fission weapons may have an unboosted yield in this range, which is sufficient to start deuterium-tritium fusion in the boost gas at the center; the fast neutrons from fusion then ensure a full fission yield. North Korea conducted a second, higher yield test on 25 May 2009 (see 2009 North Korean nuclear test) and a third test with still higher yield on 12 February 2013 (see 2013 North Korean nuclear test). North Korea claimed to have conducted its first hydrogen-bomb test on 5 January 2016, though measurements of seismic disturbances indicate that the detonation was not consistent with a hydrogen bomb.[73] However, on 3 September 2017, North Korea detonated a device which caused a magnitude 6.1 tremor, consistent with a low-powered thermonuclear detonation; NORSAR estimates the yield at 250 kilotons[74] of TNT.\\r\\nIsrael is widely believed to have been the sixth country in the world to develop nuclear weapons, but has not acknowledged its nuclear forces. It had \\"rudimentary, but deliverable,\\" nuclear weapons available as early as 1967.[75] Israel is not a party to the NPT. Israel engages in strategic ambiguity, saying it would not be the first country to \\"introduce\\" nuclear weapons into the region, but refusing to otherwise confirm or deny a nuclear weapons program or arsenal. This policy of \\"nuclear opacity\\" has been interpreted as an attempt to get the benefits of deterrence with a minimum political cost.[75][76]\\r\\nAccording to the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Federation of American Scientists, Israel likely possesses around 75ÿ200 nuclear weapons.[29][77] The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that Israel has approximately 80 intact nuclear weapons, of which 50 are for delivery by Jericho II medium-range ballistic missiles and 30 are gravity bombs for delivery by aircraft. SIPRI also reports that there was renewed speculation in 2012 that Israel may also have developed nuclear-capable submarine-launched cruise missiles.[78]\\r\\nUnder NATO nuclear weapons sharing, the United States has provided nuclear weapons for Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey to deploy and store.[83] This involves pilots and other staff of the \\"non-nuclear\\" NATO states practicing, handling, and delivering the U.S. nuclear bombs, and adapting non-U.S. warplanes to deliver U.S. nuclear bombs. However, since all U.S. nuclear weapons are protected with Permissive Action Links, the host states cannot easily arm the bombs without authorization codes from the U.S. Department of Defense.[84] Former Italian President Francesco Cossiga acknowledged the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons in Italy.[85] U.S. nuclear weapons were also deployed in Canada as well as Greece from 1963 to 1984. However, Canada withdrew three of the four nuclear-capable weapons systems by 1972. The single system retained, the AIR-2 Genie, had a yield 1.5 kilotons, was designed to strike enemy aircraft as opposed to ground targets, and might not have qualified as a weapon of mass destruction given its limited yield.[86]\\r\\nMembers of the Non-Aligned Movement have called on all countries to \\"refrain from nuclear sharing for military purposes under any kind of security arrangements.\\"[87] The Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) has criticized the arrangement for allegedly violating Articles I and II of the NPT, arguing that \\"these Articles do not permit the NWS to delegate the control of their nuclear weapons directly or indirectly to others.\\"[88] NATO has argued that the weapons' sharing is compliant with the NPT because \\"the U.S. nuclear weapons based in Europe are in the sole possession and under constant and complete custody and control of the United States.\\"[89]\\r\\nNuclear weapons have been present in many nations, often as staging grounds under control of other powers. However, in only one instance has a nation given up nuclear weapons after being in full control of them. The fall of the Soviet Union left several former Soviet republics in physical possession of nuclear weapons, though not operational control which was dependent on Russian-controlled electronic Permissive Action Links and the Russian command and control system.[90][91]\\r\\nSouth Africa produced six nuclear weapons in the 1980s, but dismantled them in the early 1990s.\\r\\nIn 1979, there was a detection of a putative covert nuclear test in the Indian Ocean, called the Vela incident. It has long been speculated that it was a test by Israel, in collaboration with and support of South Africa, though this has never been confirmed. South Africa could not have constructed such a nuclear bomb until November 1979, two months after the \\"double flash\\" incident. South Africa signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.[93][94]","input":"Who has the most number of nuclear weapons?"},{"output":"Overton's","context":"The Citrus Bowl, officially the Citrus Bowl presented by Overton's, boating and marine supply, for sponsorship purposes,[1] is an annual college football bowl game played at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida.[2] It was previously known as the Tangerine Bowl (1947ÿ1982), the Florida Citrus Bowl (1983ÿ2002), the Capital One Bowl (2003ÿ2014) and the Buffalo Wild Wings Citrus Bowl (2015ÿ2017). The bowl is operated by Florida Citrus Sports, a non-profit group that also organizes the Camping World Bowl and Florida Classic.\\r\\nSince becoming one of the premier bowls, the Citrus Bowl is typically played at 1 p.m. EST on New Year's Day, immediately before the Rose Bowl, both of which have been televised on ESPN since 2011. When January 1 is a Sunday, the game has been played on January 2 or December 31, to avoid conflicting with the National Football League schedule. As of 2015[update], at $4.25 million per team,[3] it has the largest payout of all the non-College Football Playoff (CFP) bowls. In nearly every year since 1985, the game has featured two teams ranked in the Top 25.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game, which began play in 1947, is one of the oldest of the non-CFP bowls, along with the Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl. By 1952, the game was dubbed the \\"Little Bowl with the Big Heart\\", because all the proceeds from the game went to charity.\\r\\nBefore 1968, the game featured matchups between schools throughout the South, often featuring the Ohio Valley Conference champion or other small colleges, although a few major colleges did play in the bowl during this early era as well.\\r\\nFrom 1964 through 1967, it was one of the four regional finals in the College Division (which became Division II and Division III in 1973), along with the Pecan, Grantland Rice, and Camellia bowls.\\r\\nIn 1968, the Boardwalk Bowl in Atlantic City took over as a regional final, and the Tangerine Bowl became a major college bowl game, featuring teams from the University Division (which became Division I in 1973).\\r\\nIn 1986, it was one of the bowl games considered for the site of the \\"winner take all\\" national championship game between Penn State and Miami, before the Fiesta Bowl was eventually chosen.\\r\\nThe 1990 season game had national championship implications; Georgia Tech won the Florida Citrus Bowl, finished 11ÿ0ÿ1, and were voted the 1990 UPI national champion.\\r\\nThe 1997 season game, which featured nearby Florida beating Penn State, holds the game's attendance record at 72,940.\\r\\nIn 2004, the bowl bid to become the fifth BCS game, but was not chosen, primarily due to the stadium's aging condition. In July 2007, the Orange County Commissioners voted in favor of spending $1.1 billion to build the Amway Center for the Orlando Magic, the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, and to upgrade the Citrus Bowl stadium.\\r\\nFollowing the 2014 game, Capital One ceased its sponsorship of the bowl, and moved its sponsorship to the Orange Bowl.[4] Buffalo Wild Wings was announced as the new title sponsor of the bowl game in 2014. Buffalo Wild Wings had previously been the title sponsor of what is now the Cactus Bowl.[5] In the offseason of 2017, Buffalo Wild Wings ceased sponsoring the bowl as the search for a new sponsor is ongoing.\\r\\nThe 2016 season game was played on December 31, the first time in 30 years that the game was not played on January 1st or 2nd.\\r\\nFrom 1968 through 1975, the bowl featured the Mid-American Conference (MAC) champion against an opponent from the Southern Conference (1968ÿ1971), the Southeastern Conference (SEC) (1973ÿ1974), or an at-large opponent (1972, 1975). MAC teams were 6ÿ2 during those games.\\r\\nAs the major football conferences relaxed restrictions on post-season play in the mid-1970s, the bowl went to a matchup between two at-large teams from major conferences, with one school typically (but not always) from the South.\\r\\nFrom the 1987 season through the 1991 season, the bowl featured the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) champion against an at-large opponent. ACC teams were 3ÿ2 during those games.\\r\\nFrom the 1992 season through the 2015 season, the bowl featured an SEC vs. Big Ten matchup ÿ the SEC won 14 of those games, while the Big Ten won 10.\\r\\nDuring the 1990s, the second-place finisher in the SEC typically went to this bowl. Florida coach Steve Spurrier, speaking to the fact that Tennessee occupied that spot three of four years as Florida finished first, famously quipped \\"You can't spell 'Citrus' without U-T!\\"[6]\\r\\nCurrently, the bowl has tie-ins with the SEC and the Big Ten, holding the first selection after the CFP selection process for both conferences. Since the formation of the CFP, the Citrus Bowl has a chance to occasionally host an ACC team, replacing the Big Ten representative. This will happen the years in which the Orange Bowl is not a CFP semi-final game and selects a Big Ten team to match against their ACC team. This happened following the 2016 season, as the Orange Bowl was not a CFP semi-final and invited Michigan of the Big Ten to face Florida State of the ACC; the Citrus Bowl then invited Louisville of the ACC to face LSU of the SEC.[7] The next year, Wisconsin was invited to the Orange Bowl, so the SEC's LSU was pitted against Notre Dame, who received an invite in lieu of an ACC team.\\r\\nThe undefeated 1955 Hillsdale College football team refused an invitation to the game when bowl officials insisted that Hillsdale's four African-American players would not be allowed to play in the game.[8][9]\\r\\nThe University at Buffalo's first bowl bid was to the Tangerine Bowl in 1958. The Tangerine Bowl Commission hoped that the Orlando High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), which operated the stadium, would waive its rule that prohibited integrated sporting events. When it refused, the team unanimously voted to skip the bowl because its two black players (halfback Willie Evans and end Mike Wilson) would not have been allowed on the field.[10] Buffalo would not be bowl-eligible for another 50 years. During the 2008 season, when the Bulls were on the verge of bowl eligibility, the 1958 team was profiled on ESPN's Outside the Lines.[11][12] The 2008 team went on to win the Mid-American Conference title, and played in the International Bowl.\\r\\nBy 1966, the OHSAA's rule had been changed, and Morgan State of Baltimore, under head coach Earl Banks, became the first historically black college to play in (and win) the Tangerine Bowl.[13]\\r\\nIn early 1973, construction improvements were planned for the then 17,000-seat Tangerine Bowl stadium to expand to over 51,000 seats. In early summer 1973, however, construction was stalled due to legal concerns, and the improvements were delayed. Late in the 1973 season, Tangerine Bowl President Will Gieger and other officials planned to invite the Miami Redskins and the East Carolina Pirates to Orlando for the game. On November 19, 1973, East Carolina withdrew its interests, and the bowl was left with one at-large bid. In an unexpected and unprecedented move, game officials decided to invite the Florida Gators, and move the game to Florida Field in Gainesville, the Gators' home stadium. The larger stadium would be needed to accommodate the large crowd expected. The move required special permission from the NCAA, and special accommodations were made. Both teams would be headquartered in Orlando for the week, and spend most of their time there, including practices, and would be bused up to Gainesville.\\r\\nThe participants were greeted with an unexpected event, a near-record low temperature of 25 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 degrees Celsius). Despite the home-field advantage, in the game nicknamed the \\"Transplant Bowl\\",[14] Miami (OH), who found the cold much more to its liking, defeated the Gators 16ÿ7. One of the players on the victorious Redskins squad was future Gators coach Ron Zook.\\r\\nThe one-time moving of the game, and the fears of a permanent relocation, rejuvenated the stalled stadium renovations in Orlando. The game returned to Orlando for 1974, and within a couple of years, the expansion project was complete.\\r\\nThe \\"Capital One Mascot Challenge\\" (formerly known as the \\"Capital One National Mascot of the Year\\") was a contest where fans voted for their favorite college mascot. The contest began in 2002 with the winner being named during the halftime; the winning school was awarded $20,000 towards their mascot program.

It looks similar to an upright piano (four- or five-octave), albeit with smaller keys and a much smaller sized cabinet, or a large wooden music box (three-octave). The keys connect to hammers that strike a graduated set of metal (usually steel) plates or bars suspended over wooden resonators. Four- or five-octave models usually have a damper pedal that sustains or damps the sound. The three-octave instruments do not have a pedal because of their small \\"table-top\\" design. One of the best-known works that uses the celesta is Tchaikovsky's \\"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\\" from The Nutcracker.\\r\\nThe sound of the celesta is similar to that of the glockenspiel, but with a much softer and more subtle timbre. This quality gave the instrument its name, celeste, meaning \\"heavenly\\" in French. The celesta is often used to enhance a melody line played by another instrument or section. The delicate, bell-like sound is not loud enough to be used in full ensemble sections; as well, the celesta is rarely given standalone solos.\\r\\nThe celesta is a transposing instrument; it sounds one octave higher than the written pitch. Its (four-octave) sounding range is generally considered to be C4 to C8. The original French instrument had a five-octave range, but because the lowest octave was considered somewhat unsatisfactory, it was omitted from later models. The standard French four-octave instrument is now gradually being replaced in symphony orchestras by a larger, five-octave German model. Although it is a member of the percussion family, in orchestral terms it is more properly considered a member of the keyboard section and usually played by a keyboardist. The celesta part is normally written on two braced staves, called a grand staff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe celesta was invented in 1886 by Parisian harmonium builder Auguste Mustel. His father, Victor Mustel, had developed the forerunner of the celesta, the typophone, in 1860. This instrument produced sound by striking tuning forks instead of the metal plates that would be used in the celesta. The dulcitone functioned identically to the typophone and was developed concurrently in Scotland; it is unclear whether their creators were aware of one another's instrument.[1] The typophone/dulcitone's uses were limited by its low volume, too quiet to be heard in a full orchestra.\\r\\nPyotr Tchaikovsky is usually cited as the first major composer to use this instrument in a work for full symphony orchestra. He first used it in his symphonic poem The Voyevoda, Op. posth. 78, premiered in November 1891.[2] The following year, he used the celesta in passages in his ballet The Nutcracker (Op. 71, 1892), most notably in the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, which also appears in the derived Nutcracker Suite, Op. 71a. However, Ernest Chausson preceded Tchaikovsky by employing the celesta in December 1888 in his incidental music, written for a small orchestra, for La tempte (a French translation by Maurice Bouchor of Shakespeare's The Tempest).[3]\\r\\nThe celesta is also notably used in Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 6, particularly in the 1st, 2nd and 4th movements, in his Symphony No. 8 and Das Lied von der Erde. Karol Szymanowski featured it in his Symphony No. 3. Gustav Holst employed the instrument in his 1918 orchestral work The Planets, particularly in the final movement, Neptune, the Mystic. It also features prominently in Bla Bart܇k's 1936 Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta. George Gershwin included a celesta solo in the score to An American in Paris. Ferde Grofe also wrote an extended cadenza for the instrument in the third movement of his Grand Canyon Suite. Dmitri Shostakovich included parts for celesta in seven out of his fifteen symphonies, with a notable use in the fourth symphony's coda.\\r\\n20th Century American composer Morton Feldman used the celesta in many of his large-scale chamber pieces such as Crippled Symmetry and For Philip Guston, and it figured in much of his orchestral music and other pieces as well. In some works, such as \\"Five Pianos\\" one of the players doubles on celesta.\\r\\nThe celesta is used in many 20th century opera scores, including Puccini's Tosca (1900),[citation needed] Ravel's L'heure espagnole (1911) and L'enfant et les sortileges (1925),[citation needed] Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos (1912),[citation needed] and Die Frau ohne Schatten (1918),[citation needed] while \\"an excellent example of its beauty when well employed\\", is the Silver Rose scene in his Der Rosenkavalier (1911),[4] Busoni's Arlecchino (1917) and Doktor Faust (1925),[citation needed], Orff's Carmina Burana[5] (1936) and Der Mond (1939),[citation needed] Menotti's Amelia Goes to the Ball (1937),[citation needed] Britten's The Turn of the Screw (1954) and A Midsummer Night's Dream (1960),[citation needed] Susa's Transformations (1973),[citation needed] and Philip Glass' Akhnaten (1984).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe keyboard glockenspiel part in Mozart's The Magic Flute is nowadays often played by a celesta.[6]\\r\\nSince Earl Hines took it up in 1928, other jazz pianists have occasionally used the celesta as an alternative instrument. In the 1930s, Fats Waller sometimes played celesta with his right hand and piano simultaneously with his left hand. Other notable jazz pianists who occasionally played the celesta include Memphis Slim, Meade \\"Lux\\" Lewis, Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith, Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Buddy Greco, Oscar Peterson, McCoy Tyner, Sun Ra, Keith Jarrett, and Herbie Hancock. A celesta provides the introduction to Someday You'll Be Sorry, a song Louis Armstrong recorded for RCA, and is featured prominently throughout the piece.[citation needed] A number of recordings Frank Sinatra made for Columbia in the 1940s feature the instrument (namely I'll Never Smile Again),[7] as do many of his albums recorded for Capitol in the 1950s (In the Wee Small Hours, Close to You and Songs for Swingin' Lovers).[8] The instrument is used prominently in the introduction to the 1928 recording by Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five of \\"Basin Street Blues\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nNotable pop and rock songs recorded with the celesta include:\\r\\nIcelandic singer Bj?rk commissioned an instrument, dubbed the gameleste, combining the properties of a celesta and a gamelan metallophone, for her 2011 album Biophilia.[citation needed] Before the instrument was converted, Icelandic band Sigur R܇s borrowed it for their album Takk.[13] The lead singer Jonsi used a celesta in Go Quiet, the acoustic version of his solo album Go. Steven Wilson uses the celesta on various tracks in his solo works.\\r\\nThe Italian 1970s progressive rock band Celeste was named after the instrument.\\r\\nBruce Springsteen and the E Street Band used a celesta heavily in their early days, with Danny Federici often playing a Jenco Celestette in the band's live performances throughout the 1970s and 80s.\\r\\nSheryl Crow plays celesta on her 2017 album, Be Myself.[14]\\r\\nThe celesta has been common in cinema for decades. In addition to supplementing numerous soundtrack orchestrations for films of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, the celesta has occasionally been spotlighted to invoke a whimsical air. For example, in Pinocchio (1940), a small motif on the celesta is used whenever the Blue Fairy appears out of thin air or performs magic. Celesta also provides the signature opening of Pure Imagination, a song (sung by Gene Wilder) from the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.[citation needed] Composer John Williams's scores for the first three Harry Potter films feature the instrument, particularly in the first two films' frequent statements of \\"Hedwig's Theme\\".\\r\\nAnother notable use of the celesta was in the music on children's television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. It was most famously heard in the intro to the theme song of the program, \\"Won't You Be My Neighbor\\", which began with a dreamy sequence on the instrument. The song was sung by Fred Rogers and played by Johnny Costa. It was also used from time to time in other music sequences throughout the program, such as the one heard as the Neighborhood Trolley moved in and out of the Neighborhood of Make Believe.\\r\\nThe original version of the familiar Think! theme from the popular game show Jeopardy! has a celesta lead in the first verse.[citation needed] It was composed by Merv Griffin, and it was used during the Art Fleming era and the first thirteen seasons of the current Alex Trebek syndicated version.\\r\\nA celesta is used in the full orchestral version of the theme song from the TV series The West Wing, composed by W. G. Snuffy Walden.[15]\\r\\nSchiedmayer[16] and Yamaha[17] are the only companies currently making celestas. Other known manufacturers that made celestas in the past include:\\r\\nIf an ensemble or orchestra lacks a celesta, a piano, synthesizer, or sampler and electronic keyboards are often used as a substitute.","input":"What instrument is used for the harry potter theme song?"},{"output":"the Yucatn Peninsula","context":"","input":"On what peninsula was the mayan civilization based?"},{"output":"Brian Acton","context":"WhatsApp Messenger is a freeware and cross-platform instant messaging service for smartphones.[10] It uses the Internet to make voice calls, one to one video calls; send text messages, images, GIF, videos, documents, user location, audio files, phone contacts and voice notes[11][12] using standard cellular mobile numbers. Originally users could only communicate with other users individually or in groups of individual users, but in September 2017 WhatsApp announced a forthcoming business platform which will enable companies to provide customer service to users at scale.[13] All data are end-to-end encrypted. It also incorporates a feature called Status, which allows users to upload photos and videos to a 24-hours-lifetime feed that, by default, are visible to all contacts, similar to Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram Stories.\\r\\nThe client was created by WhatsApp Inc., based in Mountain View, California, which was acquired by Facebook in February 2014 for approximately US$19.3 billion.[14][15] By February 2016, WhatsApp had a user base of over one billion,[16][17] making it the most popular messaging application at the time.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatsApp, was incorporated in 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, both former employees of Yahoo! . After Koum and Acton left Yahoo! in September 2007, the duo traveled to South America as a break from work.[19] At one point they applied for jobs at Facebook but were rejected.[19] For the rest of the following years Koum relied on his $400,000 savings from Yahoo!. In January 2009, after purchasing an iPhone and realizing that the App Store would soon create an industry of apps, Koum started visiting his friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose where the three would discuss \\".... having statuses next to individual names of the people\\", but this was not possible without an iPhone developer. Fishman found a Russian developer on RentACoder.com, Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum. Koum named the app \\"WhatsApp\\" to sound like \\"what's up\\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, because early versions of WhatsApp often crashed or got stuck at a particular point, Koum felt like giving up and looking for a new job, upon which Acton encouraged him to wait for a \\"few more months\\".[19]\\r\\nIn June 2009, Apple launched push notifications, allowing users to be pinged when they were not using an app. Koum changed WhatsApp so that when a user's status is changed, everyone in the user's network would be notified.[19] WhatsApp 2.0 was released with a messaging component and the number of active users suddenly increased to 250,000. Acton was still unemployed and managing another startup, and he decided to join the company.[19] In October 2009, Acton persuaded five former friends in Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in seed funding, and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake. He officially joined on November 1.[19] After months at beta stage, the application eventually launched in November 2009 exclusively on the App Store for the iPhone. Koum then hired a friend who lived in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to develop the BlackBerry version, which arrived two months later.[19]\\r\\nWhatsApp was switched from a free to paid service to avoid growing too fast, mainly because the primary cost was sending verification texts to users. In December 2009, the ability to send photos was added to WhatsApp for the iPhone. By early 2011, WhatsApp was one of the top 20 apps in Apple's U.S. App Store.[19]\\r\\nIn April 2011, Sequoia Capital was the only venture investor in WhatsApp and paid approximately $8 million for more than 15 percent of the company, after months of negotiation with Sequoia partner Jim Goetz.[20][21][22]\\r\\nBy February 2013, WhatsApp had about 200 million active users and 50 staff members. Sequoia invested another $50 million, and WhatsApp was valued at $1.5 billion.[19]\\r\\nIn a December 2013 blog post, WhatsApp claimed that 400 million active users use the service each month.[23] As of April 22, 2014, WhatsApp had over 500 million monthly active users, 700 million photos and 100 million videos were being shared daily, and the messaging system was handling more than 10 billion messages each day.[24] On August 24, 2014, Koum announced on his Twitter account that WhatsApp had over 600 million active users worldwide. At that point WhatsApp was adding about 25 million new users every month, or 833,000 active users per day.[25][26] With 65 million active users representing 10% of the total worldwide users, India has the largest number of consumers.[27]\\r\\nOn February 19, 2014, months after a venture capital financing round at a $1.5 billion valuation,[28] Facebook announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 billion, its largest acquisition to date.[15] At the time, the acquisition was the largest purchase of a venture-backed company in history.[14] Sequoia Capital received an approximate 50x return on its initial investment.[29] Facebook, which was advised by Allen & Co, paid $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares, and (advised by Morgan Stanley) an additional $3 billion in restricted stock units granted to WhatsApp's founders, Koum and Acton.[30] Employee stock was scheduled to vest over four years subsequent to closing.[15] Days after the announcement, WhatsApp users experienced a loss of service, leading to anger across social media.[31]\\r\\nThe acquisition caused a considerable number of users to move, or try out other message services as well. Telegram claimed to have seen 8 million additional downloads of its app.[32] Line claimed to have seen 2 million new users for its service.[33]\\r\\nAt a keynote presentation at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2014, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp was closely related to the Internet.org vision.[34][35] According to a TechCrunch article, Zuckerberg's vision for Internet.org was as follows: \\"The idea, he said, is to develop a group of basic internet services that would be free of charge to use ÿ 'a 911 for the internet.' These could be a social networking service like Facebook, a messaging service, maybe search and other things like weather. Providing a bundle of these free of charge to users will work like a gateway drug of sorts ÿ users who may be able to afford data services and phones these days just dont see the point of why they would pay for those data services. This would give them some context for why they are important, and that will lead them to paying for more services like this ÿ or so the hope goes.\\"[34]\\r\\nOn May 9, 2014, the government of Iran announced that it had proposed to block the access to WhatsApp service to Iranian residents. \\"The reason for this is the assumption of WhatsApp by the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is an American Zionist,\\" said Abdolsamad Khorramabadi, head of the country's Committee on Internet Crimes. Subsequently, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani issued an order to the Ministry of ICT to stop filtering WhatsApp.[36][37]\\r\\nJust three days after announcing that WhatsApp had been purchased by Facebook, Koum said they were working to introduce voice calls in the coming months. He also advanced that new mobile phones would be sold in Germany with the WhatsApp brand, as their main goal was to be in all smartphones.[38]\\r\\nIn August 2014, WhatsApp was the most globally popular messaging app, with more than 600 million active users.[25] By early January 2015, WhatsApp had 700 million monthly active users with over 30 billion messages being sent every day.[39] In April 2015, Forbes predicted that between 2012 and 2018, the telecommunications industry will lose a combined total of $386 billion because of OTT services like WhatsApp and Skype.[40] That month, WhatsApp had over 800 million active users.[41][42] By September 2015, the user base had grown to 900 million,[43] and by February 2016 it had grown to one billion.[16]\\r\\nAs of November 30, 2015, the Android client for WhatsApp started making links to another messenger called Telegram unclickable and uncopyable.[44][45][46] This is an active block, as confirmed by multiple sources, rather than a bug,[46] and the Android source code which recognises Telegram URLs has been identified.[46] URLs with \\"telegram\\" as domain-name are targeted actively and explicitly?ÿ the word \\"telegram\\" appears in the code.[46] This functioning risks being considered anti-competitive,[44][45][46] and has not been explained by WhatsApp.\\r\\nOn January 18, 2016, WhatsApp's founder Jan Koum announced that the service would no longer charge their users a $1 annual subscription fee in an effort to remove a barrier faced by some users who do not have a credit card to pay for the service.[47][48] He also explained that the app would not display any third party advertisement and instead would bring new features such as the ability to communicate with business organizations.[16][49]\\r\\nBy June 2016, more than 100 million voice calls are made per day on WhatsApp according to a post on the company's blog.[50]\\r\\nOn November 10, 2016, WhatsApp has started rolling out two-step verification feature for users on Android beta. This feature will add more security to your account, officials said. After enabling this feature, users will also get an option to add their email address for further protection.[51] Also in November 2016, Facebook ceased collecting WhatsApp data for advertising in Europe.[52]\\r\\nOn February 24, 2017, (WhatsApp's 8th birthday) WhatsApp launches new Status feature that offering similar to Snapchat.[53]\\r\\nOn May 18, 2017, it was reported that the European Commission was fining Facebook ?110 million for \\"misleading\\" it during the 2014 takeover of WhatsApp. The Commission alleged that in 2014, when Facebook acquired the messaging app, it \\"falsely claimed it was technically impossible to automatically combine user information from Facebook and WhatsApp.\\" However, in the summer of 2016 WhatsApp had begun sharing user information with its parent company, allowing information such as phone numbers to be used for targeted Facebook advertisements. Facebook acknowledged the breach, but said the errors in their 2014 filings were \\"not intentional.\\"[52]\\r\\nIn September 2017 WhatsApp announced a forthcoming business platform which will enable companies to provide customer service to users at scale.[13] Airlines KLM and Aeromxico both announced their participation in the testing;[54][55] both airlines had previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform.\\r\\nUntil 2017 WhatsApp positioned itself as a solution for a single party with a single smartphone to communicate with another such party, enabling small businesses to use the platform to communicate with customers,[56] but not at scale (in a contact center environment, e.g.). However in September 2017 WhatsApp announced what had long been rumored,[57][58] that they are building and testing new tools for businesses to use WhatsApp:[59]\\r\\nAfter months at beta stage, the application eventually launched in November 2009 exclusively on the App Store for the iPhone. In January 2010, support for BlackBerry smartphones was added, and subsequently for Symbian OS in May 2010 and for Android OS in August 2010. In August 2011 a beta for Nokia's non-smartphone OS Series 40 was added. A month later support for Windows Phone was added, followed by BlackBerry 10 in March 2013.[60] In April 2015, support for Samsung's Tizen OS was added.[61] An unofficial port has been released for the MeeGo-based Nokia N9 called Wazapp,[62] as well as a port for the Maemo-based Nokia N900 called Yappari.[63]\\r\\nThe oldest device capable of running WhatsApp is the Symbian-based Nokia N95 released in March 2007.\\r\\nIn August 2014, WhatsApp released an update to its Android app, adding support for Android Wear smartwatches.[64]\\r\\nIn 2014 an unofficial open source plug-in called whatsapp-purple was released for Pidgin, implementing its XMPP and making it possible to use WhatsApp on a Windows or Linux PC.[65][third-party source needed] WhatsApp responded by automatically blocking phone numbers that connected to WhatsApp using this plug-in.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn January 21, 2015, WhatsApp launched WhatsApp Web, a web client which can be used through a web browser by syncing with the mobile device's connection.[66]\\r\\nOn February 26, 2016, WhatsApp announced they would cease support for BlackBerry (including BlackBerry 10), Series 40 and Symbian S60, as well as older versions of Android (2.2), Windows Phone (7.0) and iOS (6), by the end of 2016.[67] BlackBerry, Series 40 and Symbian support was since then extended further to June 30, 2017.[68] In June 2017 support for BlackBerry and Series 40 was once again extended until the end of 2017, while Symbian was dropped.[69]\\r\\nWhatsApp was officially made available for PCs through a web client, under the name WhatsApp Web, in late January 2015 through an announcement made by Koum on his Facebook page: \\"Our web client is simply an extension of your phone: the web browser mirrors conversations and messages from your mobile devicethis means all of your messages still live on your phone\\". The WhatsApp user's handset must still be connected to the Internet for the browser application to function. All major desktop browsers are supported except for Microsoft Internet Explorer. WhatsApp Web's user interface is based on the default Android one.\\r\\nAs of January 21, 2015, the desktop version was only available to Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone users. Later on, it also added support for iOS, Nokia Series 40, and Nokia S60 (Symbian).[70][71]\\r\\nAn unofficial derivative called WhatsAppTime has been developed, which is a standard Win32 application for PCs and supports notifications through the Windows notification area.[72] There are similar solutions for macOS, such as the open-source ChitChat[73][74][75] and multiple wrappers available in the App Store.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn May 10, 2016, the messaging service was introduced for both Windows and macOS operating systems. Similar to the WhatsApp Web format, the app, which will be synced with a user's mobile device, is available for download on the website. It supports OS versions of Windows 8 and OS X 10.9 and higher.[76][77]\\r\\nWhatsApp uses a customized version of the open standard Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).[78] Upon installation, it creates a user account using one's phone number as the username (Jabber ID: [phone number]@s.whatsapp.net).\\r\\nWhatsApp software automatically compares all the phone numbers from the device's address book with its central database of WhatsApp users to automatically add contacts to the user's WhatsApp contact list. Previously the Android and Nokia Series 40 versions used an MD5-hashed, reversed-version of the phone's IMEI as password,[79] while the iOS version used the phone's Wi-Fi MAC address instead of IMEI.[80][81] A 2012 update now generates a random password on the server side.[82]\\r\\nSome Dual SIM devices may not be compatible with WhatsApp, though there are some workarounds for this.[83]\\r\\nIn January 2015, WhatsApp introduced a voice calling feature; this helped WhatsApp to attract a completely different segment of the user population.[84] On November 14, 2016, Whatsapp added video calling feature for users across Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone devices.[85][86]\\r\\nMultimedia messages are sent by uploading the image, audio or video to be sent to an HTTP server and then sending a link to the content along with its Base64 encoded thumbnail (if applicable).[87]\\r\\nWhatsApp follows a \\"store and forward\\" mechanism for exchanging messages between two users. When a user sends a message, it first travels to the WhatsApp server where it is stored. Then the server repeatedly requests the receiver acknowledge receipt of the message. As soon as the message is acknowledged, the server drops the message; it is no longer available in database of server. WhatsApp server keeps the message only for 30 days in its database when it is not delivered (when the receiver is not active on WhatsApp for 30 days).[88][self-published source?]\\r\\nOn November 18, 2014, Open Whisper Systems announced a partnership with WhatsApp to provide end-to-end encryption by incorporating the encryption protocol used in Signal into each WhatsApp client platform.[89] Open Whisper Systems said that they had already incorporated the protocol into the latest WhatsApp client for Android, and that support for other clients, group/media messages, and key verification would be coming soon after.[90] WhatsApp confirmed the partnership to reporters, but there was no announcement or documentation about the encryption feature on the official website, and further requests for comment were declined.[91] In April 2015, German magazine Heise Security used ARP spoofing to confirm that the protocol had been implemented for Android-to-Android messages, and that WhatsApp messages from or to iPhones running iOS were still not end-to-end encrypted.[92] They expressed the concern that regular WhatsApp users still could not tell the difference between end-to-end encrypted messages and regular messages.[92] On April 5, 2016, WhatsApp and Open Whisper Systems announced that they had finished adding end-to-end encryption to \\"every form of communication\\" on WhatsApp, and that users could now verify each other's keys.[17][93] Users were also given the option to enable a trust on first use mechanism in order to be notified if a correspondent's key changes.[94] According to a white paper that was released along with the announcement, WhatsApp messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol.[95] WhatsApp calls are encrypted with SRTP, and all client-server communications are \\"layered within a separate encrypted channel\\".[95] The Signal Protocol library used by WhatsApp is open-source and published under the GPLv3 license.[95][96]\\r\\nCade Metz, writing in Wired, said \\"WhatsApp, more than any company before it, has taken encryption to the masses.\\"[10]\\r\\nWhatsApp Payments is a peer to peer money transfer feature that is set to launch in India. WhatsApp has received permission from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to enter into partnership with multiple banks in July, 2017[97] to allow users to make in-app payments and money transfers using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).[98] UPI enables account-to-account transfers from a mobile app without having any details of the beneficiary's bank.[99]\\r\\nOn May 20, 2011, an unconfirmed security researcher from the Netherlands under the pseudonym \\"WhatsappHack\\" published, to the Dutch websites Tweakers.net and GeenStijl, a method by which WhatsApp accounts could be hijacked. The researcher noticed a flaw in the authentication process, which allowed the researcher to hijack an account by trying to login with another phone number and intercepting the verification SMS text message that, under specific conditions, remained in the outbox of the Symbian phone after the WhatsApp client would attempt to send it to itself. On Android, the verification message could be obtained through reading the \\"radio\\" with a tool named \\"logcat\\". The researcher would then copy and send the intercepted verification message to the real number of the phone, using an SMS gateway to spoof the \\"sender\\" phone number to the number the researcher tried to maliciously login with. This method worked, and WhatsApp issued a patch within one day after publication of the articles, to both the Android and Symbian clients. WhatsApp did have a security mechanism, by design, which would disable the account on the phone of the original owner of the phone number, when they had a WhatsApp account.[100][101][102]\\r\\nIn May 2011, another security hole was reported which left communication through WhatsApp susceptible to packet analysis. WhatsApp communications were not encrypted, and data was sent and received in plaintext, meaning messages could easily be read if packet traces were available.[103]\\r\\nIn May 2012 security researchers noticed that new updates of WhatsApp no longer sent messages as plaintext,[104][105][106] but the cryptographic method implemented was subsequently described as \\"broken\\".[107][108] In August 2012 the WhatsApp support staff said that messages were encrypted in the \\"latest version\\" of the WhatsApp software for iOS and Android (but not BlackBerry, Windows Phone, and Symbian), without specifying the cryptographic method.[109]\\r\\nOn January 6, 2012, an unknown hacker published a website that made it possible to change the status of an arbitrary WhatsApp user, as long as the phone number was known. To make it work, it only required a restart of the app. According to the hacker, it was only one of many security problems in WhatsApp. On January 9, WhatsApp reported that it had resolved the problem, although the only measure actually taken was to block the website's IP address. As a reaction, a Windows tool was made available for download providing the same functionality. This problem has since been resolved in the form of an IP address check on currently logged-in sessions.[110][111]\\r\\nGerman Tech site The H demonstrated how to use WhatsAPI to hijack any WhatsApp account on September 14, 2012.[112] Shortly after, a legal threat to WhatsAPI's developers was alleged, characterized by The H as \\"an apparent reaction\\" to security reports, and WhatsAPI's source code was taken down for some days.[113] The WhatsAPI team has since returned to active development.[114]\\r\\nOn March 31, 2013 the Saudi Arabian Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) issued a statement regarding possible measures against WhatsApp, among other applications, unless the service providers took serious steps to comply with monitoring and privacy regulations.[115][needs update]\\r\\nIn February 2014, the public authority for data privacy of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein advised against using WhatsApp, as the service lacked privacy protection such as end-to-end client side encryption technology.[116] WhatsApp started implementing end-to-end encryption in late 2014 and finished in April 2016.[17]\\r\\nA major privacy and security problem has been the subject of a joint Canadian-Dutch government investigation. The primary concern was that WhatsApp required users to upload their mobile phone's entire address book to WhatsApp servers so that WhatsApp could discover who, among the users' contacts, was available via WhatsApp. While this was a fast and convenient way to quickly find and connect the user with contacts who were also using WhatsApp, it meant that their address book was then mirrored on the WhatsApp servers, including contact information for contacts who were not using WhatsApp. This information, which consisted solely of phone numbers without any additional information such as the name of the contact, was stored in hashed, though not salted, form.[117][118][119][120] Late 2015, the Dutch government released a press-statement claiming that WhatsApp had changed its hashing method, making it much harder to reverse, and thus now fully complies with all rules and regulations.[121]\\r\\nA user does not need to send a friend request to send messages to another user, due to the contact discovery mentioned above.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn November 2014, WhatsApp introduced a feature named Read Receipts which alerts senders when their messages are read by recipients. Within a week, WhatsApp introduced an update allowing users to disable this feature so that message recipients do not send acknowledgements.[122] On December 1, 2014, Indrajeet Bhuyan and Saurav Kar, both 17 years old, demonstrated the WhatsApp Message Handler Vulnerability, which allows anyone to remotely crash WhatsApp just by sending a specially crafted message of 2kb in size. To escape the problem, the user who receives the specially crafted message has to delete his/her whole conversation and start a fresh chat, because opening the message keeps on crashing WhatsApp unless the chat is deleted completely.[123] In early 2015, after WhatsApp launched a web client that can be used from the browser, Bhuyan also found that it had two security issues that compromised user privacy: the WhatsApp Photo Privacy Bug and the WhatsApp Web Photo Sync Bug.[124][125]\\r\\nIn February 2015, a Dutch university student named Maikel Zweerink published an app that set out to prove that anyone could track a WhatsApp user's status and also keep an eye of their changing profile pictures, privacy settings or status messages regardless of their privacy settings.[126]\\r\\nOn March 2, 2016, WhatsApp introduced its document-sharing feature, initially allowing users to share PDF files with their contacts.[127] However, WhatsApp's default state of automatically downloading attachments raised some concerns in the press about risk and security once support for document sharing expanded beyond PDF files.[128]\\r\\nIn August 2016, WhatsApp announced that it will start sharing account information with Facebook, consisting of the phone number of the account owner and aggregated analytical data. The address books and metadata of users are not shared. According to WhatsApp, this account information is shared to \\"track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp. And by connecting your phone number with Facebook's systems, Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them.\\" This means that Facebook can target advertisements on the Facebook Platform better by making links between users based on the phone numbers, and make \\"friend suggestions\\" to its users based on WhatsApp's data. User data will not be shared with advertisers, and is only used internally on the Facebook services. WhatsApp emphasizes the content of user messages is still kept private thanks to its end-to-end encryption, which means WhatsApp cannot read the content of chats.[129][130] However, users are given the choice to opt out of sharing this data with Facebook for advertisement purposes.[131] In October 2016, Article 29 Working Party stated that it has serious concerns regarding the manner in which the information relating to the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy was provided to users and consequently about the validity of the users consent.[132]\\r\\nFrom April 5, 2016, end-to-end encryption for all users' communications, including file transfers and voice calls, is supported for users of the latest client, encryption being enabled by default. It uses Curve25519 for key exchange, HKDF for generation of session keys (AES-256 in CBC mode for encryption and HMAC-SHA256 for integrity verification) and SHA512 for generating the two 30 digit fingerprints of both users' identity keys so they can verify each other as needed. Even the company would be unable to decrypt users' communications. Amnesty International and security professionals praised the move; the US Federal Bureau of Investigation criticised it as threatening the work of law enforcement.[133] Telegram, another messaging service, is reported by the BBC to be used by \\"Islamic State\\" extremists.[133]\\r\\nWhatsApp is not the only messaging service that provides end-to-end encryption; among others, Threema, Wickr, Signal, Silent Phone, and Line also provide such encryption by default. iMessage and Viber provide it under special circumstances.[134][135] Telegram provides end-to-end encryption as an opt-in feature, but does not support end-to-end encrypted group messaging.[17]\\r\\nAs of April 5, 2016[update], WhatsApp has a score of 6 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's \\"Secure Messaging Scorecard\\". It has received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having communications encrypted with keys the provider doesn't have access to, allowing users to verify contacts' identities, having past messages secure if the encryption keys are stolen, having completed a recent independent security audit, and having the security designs properly documented. It is missing a point because the code is not open to independent review.[136]\\r\\nOn January 13, 2017, The Guardian reported that security researcher Tobias Boelter had found that WhatsApp's policy of forcing re-encryption of initially undelivered messages, without informing the recipient, constituted a serious loophole whereby WhatsApp could disclose, or be compelled to disclose, the content of these messages.[137] WhatsApp[138] and Open Whisper Systems[139] officials disagreed with this assessment. A follow-up article by Boelter himself explains in greater detail what he considers to be the specific vulnerability.[140]\\r\\nIn response to the Facebook acquisition in 2014, Slate columnist Matthew Yglesias questioned whether the company's business model of charging users $1 a year was viable in the United States in the long term. It had prospered by exploiting a \\"loophole\\" in mobile phone carriers' pricing. \\"Mobile phone operators aren't really selling consumers some voice service, some data service, and some SMS service\\", he explained. \\"They are selling access to the network. The different pricing schemes they come up with are just different ways of trying to maximize the value they extract from consumers.\\"[141] As part of that, carriers sold SMS separately. That made it easy for WhatsApp to find a way to replicate SMS using data, and then sell that to mobile customers for $1 a year. \\"But if WhatsApp gets big enough, then carrier strategy is going to change\\", he predicted. \\"You stop selling separate SMS plans and just have a take-it-or-leave-it overall package. And then suddenly WhatsApp isn't doing anything.\\"[141] The situation may have been different in countries other than the United States.\\r\\nOn January 18, 2016, WhatsApp's founder Jan Koum announced that the service would no longer charge their users a $1 annual subscription fee in an effort to remove a barrier faced by some users who do not have a credit card to pay for the service.[47][48] He also explained that the app would not display any third party advertisement and instead would bring new features such as the ability to communicate with business organizations.[16][49]\\r\\nIn December 2015, it was reported that Islamic State terrorists had been using WhatsApp to plot the November 2015 Paris attacks.[142] ISIL also uses WhatsApp to traffic sex slaves.[143]\\r\\nIn March 2017, U.K. Secretary of State Amber Rudd said encryption capabilities of messaging tools like WhatsApp are unacceptable, as news reported that Khalid Masood used the application several minutes before perpetrating the 2017 Westminster attack. Rudd publicly called for police and intelligence agencies to be given access to WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging services to prevent future terror attacks.[144]\\r\\nIn April 2017, the perpetrator of the Stockholm attack reportedly used WhatsApp to exchange messages with an ISIS supporter shortly before and after the 2017 Stockholm attack. The messages involved discussing how to make an explosive device and a confession of the perpetration the attack.[145]\\r\\nIn May 2016, some WhatsApp users were reported to have been tricked into downloading a third-party application called WhatsApp Gold.[146] The application was part of a scam that infected the users' phones with malware.[146] Another application called \\"GB Whatsapp\\" is also considered as a related scam.[citation needed] A message that promises to allow access to their WhatsApp friends' conversations, or their contact lists, has become the most popular hit against anyone who uses the application in Brazil. Since December, 2016, more than 1.5 million people have clicked and lost money[147]\\r\\nIn September 2017, after a series of brief disruptions, security researchers reported to The New York Times that WhatsApp service had been completely blocked in China.[148][149][150]\\r\\nTurkey temporarily banned WhatsApp in 2016, following the detention of eleven Free Democratic Party (HDP) members of parliament.[151]\\r\\nOn December 17, 2015, mobile providers in Brazil were ordered to block WhatsApp for 48 hours. The ban was ordered for the service's failure to cooperate with criminal court orders in July and August 2015. The following morning, however, a judge from the appeals court ordered that the ban be lifted for being an unreasonable response, recommending that the company be fined instead. Following the ban, but prior to its reversal, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded by stating that he was \\"stunned that our efforts to protect people's data would result in such an extreme decision by a single judge to punish every person in Brazil who uses WhatsApp. We hope the Brazilian courts quickly reverse course.\\" The competing service Telegram reported that 1.5 million Brazilians had downloaded its app while the WhatsApp ban was in place.[152][153]\\r\\nOn March 1, 2016, Diego Dzodan, Facebook's vice-president for Latin America was arrested in Brazil for not cooperating with an investigation in which WhatsApp conversations were requested.[154] On March 2, 2016, at dawn the next day, Dzodan was released because the Court of Appeal held that the arrest was disproportionate and unreasonable.[155]\\r\\nOn May 2, 2016, mobile providers in Brazil were ordered to block WhatsApp for 72 hours for the service's second failure to cooperate with criminal court orders.[156][157] Once again, the block was lifted following an appeal, after nearly 24 hours.[158]\\r\\nIn April 2014, WhatsApp crossed half-a-billion user mark.[159]\\r\\nIn May 2014, WhatsApp crossed 50 million monthly active users in India, which is also its largest country by the number of monthly active users.[160]\\r\\nIn October 2014, WhatsApp crossed 70 million monthly active users in India, which is 10% of its total user base (700 MM).[161]\\r\\nIn February 2017, WhatsApp crossed 200 million monthly active users in India.[162]\\r\\nAs of February 2017, WhatsApp has over 1.2 billion users globally.[163]\\r\\nWhatsApp competes with a number of Asian-based messaging services (that as of 2014, were services like WeChat (468 million active users), Viber (209 million active users[164]) and LINE (170 million active users[165])), WhatsApp handled ten billion messages per day in August 2012,[166] growing from two billion in April 2012,[167] and one billion the previous October.[168] On June 13, 2013, WhatsApp announced that they had reached their new daily record by processing 27 billion messages.[169] According to the Financial Times, WhatsApp \\"has done to SMS on mobile phones what Skype did to international calling on landlines.\\"[170]","input":"Who is the inventor of what's app?"},{"output":"Angel Oak Park on Johns Island near Charleston, South Carolina","context":"Angel Oak is a Southern live oak (Quercus virginiana) located in Angel Oak Park on Johns Island near Charleston, South Carolina.

Flyorov wrote a letter to Stalin urging him to start this program in 1942.[9]:78ÿ79 Initial efforts were slowed due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union and remained largely composed of the intelligence knowledge gained from the spy rings working in the U.S.' Manhattan Project in 1943.[2]\\r\\nAfter learning of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that ended the Pacific War in 1945, the program was aggressively pursued, mainly through effective intelligence gathering about the German weapon project and the American Manhattan Project.[10] The Russian efforts also rounded up captured German scientists to join their program, and relied heavily on knowledge passed by the spy ring to the Russian intelligence agencies.[11]:242ÿ243\\r\\nOn 29 August 1949, the Soviet Union secretly conducted its first successful weapon test (First Lightning), based on the U.S. design at the Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as 1910 in Russia, independent research was being conducted on radioactive elements by several Russian scientists.:44[12]:24ÿ25[13] Despite the hardship faced by the Russian academy of sciences during the national revolution in 1917, followed by the violent civil war in 1922, the Russian scientists had made remarkable efforts towards the advancement of physics research in the Soviet Union in the 1930s.[14]:35ÿ36 Before the first revolution in 1905, the mineralogist Vladimir Vernadsky had made a number of public calls for a survey of Russia's uranium deposits but none were heeded.[14]:37\\r\\nHowever, such early efforts were independently and privately funded by various organizations until 1922 when the Radium Institute in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) opened and industrialized the research.:44[12]\\r\\nFrom the 1920s until the late 1930s, Russian physicists had been conducting joint research with their European counterparts on the advancement of atomic physics at the Cavendish Laboratory run by a British physicist, Ernest Rutherford, where Georgi Gamov and Pyotr Kapitsa had studied and researched.[14]:36\\r\\nInfluential research towards the advancement of nuclear physics was guided by Abram Ioffe, who was the director at the Leningrad Physical-Technical Institute (LPTI), having sponsored various research program at various technical schools in the Soviet Union.[14]:36 The discovery of the neutron by the British physicist James Chadwick further provided promising expansion of the LPTI's program, with the operation of the first cyclotron to energies of over 1 MeV, and the first \\"splitting\\" of the atomic nucleus by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton.[14]:36ÿ37 Russian physicists began pushing the government, lobbying in the interest of the development of science in the Soviet Union, which had received little interest due to the upheavals created during the Russian revolution and the February Revolution.[14]:36ÿ37 Earlier research was directed towards the medical and scientific exploration of radium, that could be retrieved from borehole water from the Ukhta oilfields.[14]:37\\r\\nIn 1939, German chemist Otto Hahn reported his discovery of fission, achieved by the splitting of uranium with neutrons that produced the much lighter element barium. This eventually led to the realization among Russian scientists, and their American counterparts, that such reaction could have military significance.:20[15] The discovery excited the Russian physicists, and they began conducting their independent investigations on nuclear fission, mainly aiming towards power generation, as many were skeptical of possibility of creating an atomic bomb anytime soon.:25[16] Early efforts were led by Yakov Frenkel (a physicist specialised on condensed matter), who did the first theoretical calculations on continuum mechanics directly relating the kinematics of binding energy in fission process in 1940.:99[15] Georgy Flyorov's and Lev Rusinov's collaborative work on thermal reactions concluded that 3-1 neutrons were emitted per fission only days after similar conclusions had been reached by the team of Frdric Joliot-Curie.:63[15]:200[17]\\r\\nAfter a strong lobbying of Russian scientists, the Soviet government did initially set up a commission that was to address the \\"uranium problem\\" and investigate the possibility of chain reaction and Isotope separation.:33[18] The Uranium Problem Commission was ineffective due to the German invasion of Soviet Union that eventually limited the focus on research as Russia became engaged in a bloody conflict along the Eastern Front for the next four years.:114ÿ115[19]:200[20] The Soviet atomic weapons program had no significance and most work was unclassified as the papers were continuously published as public domain in academic journals.:33[18]\\r\\nJoseph Stalin, the Soviet leader, had mostly disregarded the atomic knowledge possessed by the Russian scientists and had most of the scientists working in the metallurgy and mining industry or serving in the Soviet Armed Forces technical branches during the World War II's eastern front in 1940ÿ42.:xx[21]\\r\\nIn 1940ÿ42, Georgy Flyorov, a Russian physicist serving as an officer in the Soviet Air Force, noted that despite progress in other areas of physics, the German, British, and American scientists had ceased publishing papers on nuclear science; clearly they each had active secret research programs.:230[22]\\r\\nIn April 1942, Flyorov directed two classified letters to Stalin, warning him of the consequences of the development of atomic weapons: \\"...the results will be so overriding [that] it won't be necessary to determine who is to blame for the fact that this work has been neglected in our country.\\":xxx[23] The second letter, by Flyorov and Konstantin Petrzhak, highly emphasized the importance of a \\"uranium bomb\\": \\"it is essential to manufacture a uranium bomb without a delay.\\":230[22]\\r\\nUpon reading the Flyorov letters, Stalin immediately pulled Russian physicists from their respective military services and authorized an atomic bomb project, under engineering physicist Anatoly Alexandrov and nuclear physicist Igor V. Kurchatov.:230[22]:xx[21] For this purpose, the Laboratory No. 2 near Moscow was established under Kurchatov.:230[22] At the same time, Flyorov was moved to Dubna, where he established the Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, focusing on synthetic elements and thermal reactions.:xx[21] In late 1942, the State Defense Committee officially delegated the program to the Soviet Army, with major wartime logistical efforts later being supervised by Lavrentiy Beria, the head of NKVD.:115:114ÿ115[19]\\r\\nIn 1945, the Arzamas 16 site near Moscow was established under Yakov Zel'dovich and Yuli Khariton who performed calculations on nuclear combustion theory, alongside Isaak Pomeranchuk.:117ÿ118[24] Despite early and accelerated efforts, it was reported by historians that efforts on building a bomb using weapon-grade uranium seemed hopeless to Russian scientists.:117ÿ118[24] Igor Kurchatov had harboured doubts working towards the uranium bomb, made progress on a bomb using weapon-grade plutonium after British data was provided by the NKVD.:117ÿ118[24]\\r\\nThe situation dramatically changed when the Soviet Union learned of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, which eventually led to the unilateral surrender of Japan to the United States, ending the war in Asia.:2ÿ5[25]\\r\\nImmediately after the atomic bombing, the Soviet Politburo took control of the atomic bomb project by establishing a special committee to oversee the development of nuclear weapons as soon as possible.:2ÿ5[25] On 9 April 1946, the Council of Ministers created the KBÿ11 Design Bureau that worked towards mapping the first nuclear weapon design, primarily based on American approach and detonated with weapon-grade plutonium.:2ÿ5[25] From this point, the work on the program was carried out quickly, resulting in the first nuclear reactor near Moscow on 25 October 1946.:2ÿ5[25]\\r\\nFrom 1941ÿ46, the Soviet Union's Ministry of Foreign Affairs handled the logistics of the atomic bomb project, with Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov controlling the direction of the program.:33[26] However, Molotov proved to be a weak administrator, and the program stagnated.[27] In contrast to American military administration in their atomic bomb project, the Russians' program was directed by political dignitaries such as Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria, Georgii Malenkov, and Mikhail Pervukhin  there were no military members.[28]\\r\\nAfter the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the program's leadership changed, when Stalin appointed Lavrentiy Beria on 22 August 1945.[27] Beria is noted for leadership that helped the program to its final implementation.[27]\\r\\nBeria understood the necessary scope and dynamics of research. This man, who was the personification of evil to modern Russian history, also possessed the great energy and capacity to work. The scientists who met him could not fail to recognize his intelligence, his will power, and his purposefullness. They found him first-class administrator who could carry a job through to completion...\\r\\nThe new Committee, under Beria, retained Georgii Malenkov and added Nikolai Voznesensky and Boris Vannikov, People's Commissar for Armament.[27] Under the administration of Beria, the NKVD co-opted atomic spies of the Soviet Atomic Spy Ring into the Western Allied program, and infiltrated the German nuclear program.[27]\\r\\nThe atomic and industrial espionages in the United States by American sympathisers of communism who were controlled by their rezident Russian officials in North America greatly aided the speed of the Soviet atomic project from 1942ÿ54.:105ÿ106[29]:287ÿ305[30] Willingness of sharing classified information to Soviet Union by recruited American communist sympathizers increased when the Soviet Union faced possible defeat during the German invasion in World War II.:287ÿ289[30] The Russian intelligence network in the United Kingdom also played a vital role in setting up the spy rings in the United States when the Russian State Defense Committee approved resolution 2352[clarification needed], in September 1942.:105ÿ106[29]\\r\\nFor this purpose, the spy Harry Gold, controlled by Semyon Semyonov, was used for a wide range of espionage that included industrial espionage in the American chemical industry and obtaining sensitive atomic information that was handed over to him by the British physicist Klaus Fuchs.:289ÿ290[30] Knowledge and further technical information that were passed by the American Theodore Hall, a theoretical physicist, and Klaus Fuchs had a significant impact on the direction of Russian development of nuclear weapons.:105[29]\\r\\nLeonid Kvasnikov, a Russian chemical engineer turned KGB officer, was assigned for this special purpose and moved to New York City to coordinate such activities.[31] Anatoli Yatzkov, another NKVD official in New York, was also involved in obtaining sensitive information gathered by Sergei Kournakov from Saville Sax.[31]\\r\\nThe existence of Russian spies were exposed by the U.S. Army's secretive Venona project in 1943.:54[32]\\r\\nFor example, Soviet work on methods of uranium isotope separation was altered when it was reported, to Kurchatov's surprise, that the Americans had opted for the Gaseous diffusion method. While research on other separation methods continued throughout the war years, the emphasis was placed on replicating U.S. success with gaseous diffusion. Another important breakthrough, attributed to intelligence, was the possibility of using plutonium instead of uranium in a fission weapon. Extraction of plutonium in the so-called \\"uranium pile\\" allowed bypassing of the difficult process of uranium separation altogether, something that Kurchatov had learned from intelligence from the Manhattan project.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1945, the Soviet intelligence obtained rough blueprints of the first U.S. atomic device.[33][34] Alexei Kojevnikov has estimated, based on newly released Soviet documents, that the primary way in which the espionage may have sped up the Soviet project was that it allowed Khariton to avoid dangerous tests to determine the size of the critical mass: \\"tickling the dragon's tail,\\" as it was called in the U.S., consumed a good deal of time and claimed at least two lives; see Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin.\\r\\nThe published Smyth Report of 1945 on the Manhattan Project was translated into Russian, and the translators noted that a sentence on the effect of \\"poisoning\\" of Plutonium-239 in the first (lithograph) edition had been deleted from the next (Princeton) edition by Groves. This change was noted by the Russian translators, and alerted the Soviet Union to the problem (which had meant that reactor-bred plutonium could not be used in a simple gun-type bomb like the proposed Thin Man).\\r\\nOne of the key pieces of information, which Soviet intelligence obtained from Fuchs, was a cross-section for D-T fusion. This data was available to top Soviet officials roughly three years before it was openly published in the Physical Review in 1949. However, this data was not forwarded to Vitaly Ginzburg or Andrei Sakharov until very late, practically months before publication.[citation needed] Initially both Ginzburg and Sakharov estimated such a cross-section to be similar to the D-D reaction. Once the actual cross-section become known to Ginzburg and Sakharov, the Sloika design become a priority, which resulted in a successful test in 1953.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, with the declassification of Soviet intelligence materials, which showed the extent and the type of the information obtained by the Soviets from US sources, a heated debate ensued in Russia and abroad as to the relative importance of espionage, as opposed to the Soviet scientists' own efforts, in the making of the Soviet bomb. The vast majority of scholars[Like whom?] agree that whereas the Soviet atomic project was first and foremost a product of local expertise and scientific talent, it is clear that espionage efforts contributed to the project in various ways and most certainly shortened the time needed to develop the atomic bomb.[citation needed]\\r\\nComparing the timelines of H-bomb development, some researchers came to the conclusion that the Soviets had a gap in access to classified information regarding the H-bomb at least between late 1950 and some time in 1953. Earlier, e.g., in 1948, Fuchs gave the Soviets a detailed update of the classical super progress[clarification needed], including an idea to use lithium, but did not explain it was specifically lithium-6. Teller accepted the fact that \\"classical super\\" scheme was infeasible by 1951, following results obtained by various researchers (including Stanislaw Ulam) and calculations performed by John von Neumann in late 1950.\\r\\nYet the research for the Soviet analogue of \\"classical super\\" continued until December 1953, when the researchers were reallocated to a new project working on what later became a true H-bomb design, based on radiation implosion. This remains an open topic for research, whether the Soviet intelligence was able to obtain any specific data on Teller-Ulam design in 1953 or early 1954. Yet, Soviet officials directed the scientists to work on a new scheme, and the entire process took less than two years, commencing around January 1954 and producing a successful test in November 1955. It also took just several months before the idea of radiation implosion was conceived, and there is no documented evidence claiming priority. It is also possible that Soviets were able to obtain a document lost by John Wheeler on a train in 1953, which reportedly contained key information about thermonuclear weapon design.\\r\\nEarly ideas of the fusion bomb came from espionage and internal Soviet studies. Though the espionage did help Soviet studies, the early American H-bomb concepts had substantial flaws, so it may have confused, rather than assisted, the Soviet effort for a nuclear bomb.[35] The designers of early thermonuclear bombs envisioned using an atomic bomb as a trigger to provide the needed heat and compression to initiate the thermonuclear reaction in a layer of liquid deuterium between the fissile material and the surrounding chemical high explosive.[36] The group would realize that a lack of sufficient heat and compression of the deuterium would result in an insignificant fusion of the deuterium fuel.[36]\\r\\nAndrei Sakharovs study group at FIAN in 1948 came up with a second concept which was adding a shell of natural, unenriched uranium around the deuterium would increase the deuterium concentration at the uranium-deuterium boundary and the overall yield of the device, because the natural uranium would capture neutrons and itself fission as part of the thermonuclear reaction. This idea of a layered fission-fusion-fission bomb led Sakharov to call it the sloika, or layered cake.[36] It was also known as the RDS-6S, or Second Idea Bomb.[37] This second bomb idea was not a fully evolved thermonuclear bomb in the contemporary sense, but a crucial step between pure fission bombs and the thermonuclear supers.[38] Due to the three-year lag in making the key breakthrough of radiation compression from the United States the Soviet Unions development efforts followed a different course of action. In the United States they decided to skip the single-stage fusion bomb and make a two-stage fusion bomb as their main effort.[36][39] Unlike the Soviet Union, the analog RDS-7 advanced fission bomb was not further developed, and instead, the single-stage 400-kiloton RDS-6S was the Soviets bomb of choice.[36] The RDS-6S Layer Cake design was detonated on 12 August 1953, producing a yield of 400 kilotons, about ten times more powerful than any previous Soviet test. Around this time the United States detonated its first super using radiation compression on 1 November 1952, code-named Mike. Though the Mike was about twenty times greater than the RDS-6S, it was not a design that was practical to use, unlike the RDS-6S.[36]\\r\\nFollowing the successful launching of the RDS-6S, Sakharov proposed an upgraded version called RDS-6SD.[36] This bomb was proved to be faulty, and it was neither built nor tested. The Soviet team had been working on the RDS-6T concept, but it also proved to be a dead end. In 1954, Sakharov worked on a third concept, a two-stage thermonuclear bomb.[36] The third idea used the radiation wave of a fission bomb, not simply heat and compression, to ignite the fusion reaction, and paralleled the discovery made by Ulam and Teller. Unlike the RDS-6S boosted bomb, which placed the fusion fuel inside the primary A-bomb trigger, the thermonuclear super placed the fusion fuel in a secondary structure a small distance from the A-bomb trigger, where it was compressed and ignited by the A-bombs x-ray radiation.[36] The KB-11 Scientific-Technical Council approved plans to proceed with the design on 24 December 1954. Technical specifications for the new bomb were completed on 3 February 1955, and it was designated the RDS-37.[36]\\r\\nThe RDS-37 was successfully tested on 22 November 1955 with a yield of 1.6 megaton. The yield was almost a hundred times greater than the first Soviet atomic bomb six years before, showing that the Soviet Union could compete with the United States.[36][40]\\r\\nThe single largest problem during the early Soviet project was the procurement of uranium ore, as the USSR had limited domestic sources at the beginning of the project. The era of domestic uranium mining can be dated exactly, to November 27, 1942, the date of a directive issued by the all-powerful wartime State Defense Committee. The first Soviet uranium mine was established in Taboshar, present-day Tajikistan, and was producing at an annual rate of a few tons of uranium concentrate by May 1943.[41] Taboshar was the first of many officially secret Soviet closed cities related to uranium mining and production.[42]\\r\\nDemand from the experimental bomb project was far higher. The Americans, with the help of Belgian businessman Edgar Sengier in 1940, had already blocked access to known sources in Congo, South Africa, and Canada. In December 1944 Stalin took the uranium project away from Vyacheslav Molotov and gave to it to Lavrentiy Beria. The first Soviet uranium processing plant was established as the Leninabad Mining and Chemical Combine in Chkalovsk (present-day Buston, Ghafurov District), Tajikistan, and new production sites identified in relative proximity. This posed a need for labor, a need that Beria would fill with forced labor: tens of thousands of Gulag prisoners were brought to work in the mines, the processing plants, and related construction.\\r\\nDomestic production was still insufficient when the Soviet F-1 reactor, which began operation in December 1946, was fueled using uranium confiscated from the remains of the German atomic bomb project. This uranium had been mined in the Belgian Congo, and the ore in Belgium fell into the hands of the Germans after their invasion and occupation of Belgium in 1940.\\r\\nFurther sources of uranium in the early years of the program were mines in East Germany (via the deceptively-named SAG Wismut), Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania (near Stei) and Poland. Boris Pregel sold 0.23 tonnes of uranium oxide to the Soviet Union during the war, with the authorisation of the U.S. Government.[43][44][45]\\r\\nEventually, large domestic sources were discovered in the Soviet Union (including those now in Kazakhstan).\\r\\nThe uranium for the Soviet nuclear weapons program came from mine production in the following countries,[46]\\r\\nRDS-1, the first Soviet atomic test was internally code-named First Lightning (楿־ 񶶷, or Pervaya Molniya) August 29, 1949, and was code-named by the Americans as Joe 1. The design was very similar to the first US \\"Fat Man\\" plutonium bomb, using a TNT/hexogen implosion lens design.\\r\\nOn September 24, 1951, the 38.3 kiloton device RDS-2 was tested based on a tritium \\"boosted\\" uranium implosion device with a levitated core.[47] This test was code named Joe 2 by the CIA.\\r\\nRDS-3 was the third Soviet atomic bomb. On October 18, 1951, the 41.2 kiloton device was detonated - a boosted weapon using a composite construction of levitated plutonium core and a uranium-235 shell. Code named Joe 3 in the USA, this was the first Soviet air-dropped bomb test. Released at an altitude of 10?km, it detonated 400 meters above the ground.\\r\\nRDS-4 represented a branch of research on small tactical weapons. It was a boosted fission device using plutonium in a \\"levitated\\" core design. The first test was an air drop on August 23, 1953, yielding 28 kilotons. In 1954, the bomb was also used during Snowball exercise in Totskoye, dropped by Tu-4 bomber on the simulated battlefield, in the presence of 40,000 infantry, tanks, and jet fighters. The RDS-4 comprised the warhead of the R-5M, the first medium-range ballistic missile in the world, which was tested with a live warhead for the first and only time on February 5, 1956\\r\\nRDS-5 was a small plutonium based device, probably using a hollow core. Two different versions were made and tested.\\r\\nRDS-6, the first Soviet test of a hydrogen bomb, took place on August 12, 1953, and was nicknamed Joe 4 by the Americans. It used a layer-cake design of fission and fusion fuels (uranium 235 and lithium-6 deuteride) and produced a yield of 400 kilotons. This yield was about ten times more powerful than any previous Soviet test.[36] When developing higher level bombs, the Soviets proceeded with the RDS-6 as their main effort instead of the analog RDS-7 advanced fission bomb. This led to the third idea bomb which is the RDS-37.[36]\\r\\nA much lower-power version of the RDS-4 with a 3-10 kiloton yield, the RDS-9 was developed for the T-5 nuclear torpedo. A 3.5 kiloton underwater test was performed with the torpedo on September 21, 1955.\\r\\nThe first Soviet test of a \\"true\\" hydrogen bomb in the megaton range was conducted on November 22, 1955. It was dubbed RDS-37 by the Soviets. It was of the multi-staged, radiation implosion thermonuclear design called Sakharov's \\"Third Idea\\" in the USSR and the Teller-Ulam design in the USA.[48]\\r\\nJoe 1, Joe 4, and RDS-37 were all tested at the Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazakhstan.\\r\\nThe Tsar Bomba (ђ^-ɾ񼼼) was the largest, most powerful thermonuclear weapon ever detonated. It was a three-stage hydrogen bomb with a yield of about 50 megatons.[49] This is equivalent to ten times the amount of all the explosives used in World War II combined.[50] It was detonated on October 30, 1961, in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, and was capable of approximately 100 megatons, but was purposely reduced shortly before the launch (this was due to the pysicists fear of irreversable damage to the earth that would or could be caused by a 100 Mgt bomb). Although weaponized, it was not entered into service; it was simply a demonstrative testing of the capabilities of the Soviet Union's military technology at that time. The heat of the explosion was estimated to potentially inflict third degree burns at 100?km distance of clear air.[51]\\r\\nChagan was a shot in the Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy or Project 7, the Soviet equivalent of the US Operation Plowshare to investigate peaceful uses of nuclear weapons. It was a subsurface detonation. It was fired on January 15, 1965. The site was a dry bed of the Chagan River at the edge of the Semipalatinsk Test Site, and was chosen such that the lip of the crater would dam the river during its high spring flow. The resultant crater had a diameter of 408 meters and was 100 meters deep. A major lake (10,000?m3) soon formed behind the 20ÿ35?m high upraised lip, known as Chagan Lake or Balapan Lake.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe photo is sometimes confused with RDS-1 in literature.\\r\\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union created at least nine closed cities, known as Atomgrads[citation needed], in which nuclear weapons-related research and development took place. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, all of the cities changed their names (most of the original code-names were simply the oblast and a number). All are still legally \\"closed\\", though some have parts of them accessible to foreign visitors with special permits (Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Zheleznogorsk).\\r\\nThe Soviets started experimenting with nuclear technology in 1943, and first tested a nuclear weapon in August 1949. Many of the fission based devices left behind radioactive isotopes which have contaminated air, water and soil in the areas immediately surrounding, downwind and downstream of the blast site. According to the records that the Russian government released in 1991, the Soviet Union tested 969 nuclear devices between 1949 and 1990.[52]:1 Soviet scientists conducted the tests with little regard for environmental and public health consequences. The detrimental effects that the toxic waste generated by weapons testing and processing of radioactive materials are still felt to this day. Even decades later, the risk of developing various types of cancer, especially that of the thyroid and the lungs, continues to be elevated far above national averages for people in affected areas.[53]:1385 Iodine-131, a radioactive isotope that is a major byproduct of fission-based weapons, is retained in the thyroid gland, and so poisoning of this kind is commonplace in impacted populations.[53]:1386\\r\\nThe Soviets set off 214 nuclear bombs in the open air between 1949 and 1962, when the United Nations banned atmospheric tests worldwide.[52]:6 The billions of radioactive particles released into the air exposed countless people to extremely mutagenic and carcinogenic materials, resulting in a myriad of deleterious genetic maladies and deformities. The majority of these tests took place at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, or STS, located in northeast Kazakhstan.[52]:61 The testing at STS alone exposed hundreds of thousands of Kazakh citizens to the harmful effects, and the site continues to be one of the most highly irradiated places on the planet.[54]:A167 When the earliest tests were being conducted, even the scientists had only a poor understanding of the medium- and long-term effects of radiation exposure. In fact, the STS was chosen as the primary site for open-air testing precisely because the Soviets were curious about the potential for lasting harm that their weapons held.[53]:1389\\r\\nContamination of air and soil due to atmospheric testing is only part of a wider issue. Water contamination due to improper disposal of spent uranium and decay of sunken nuclear-powered submarines is a major problem in the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia. Although the Russian government states that the radioactive power cores are stable, various scientists have come forth with serious concerns about the 32,000 spent nuclear fuel elements that remain in the sunken vessels.[54]:A166 There have been no major incidents other than the explosion and sinking of a nuclear-powered submarine in August 2000, but many international scientists are still uneasy at the prospect of the hulls eroding, releasing uranium into the sea and causing considerable contamination.[54]:A166 Although the submarines pose an environmental risk, they have yet to cause serious harm to public health. However, water contamination in the area of the Mayak test site, especially at Lake Karachay, is extreme, and has gotten to the point where radioactive byproducts have found their way into drinking water supplies. It has been an area of concern since the early 1950s, when the Soviets began disposing of tens of millions of cubic meters of radioactive waste by pumping it into the small lake.[54]:A165 Half a century later, in the 1990s, there are still hundreds of millions of curies of waste in the Lake, and at points contamination has been so severe that a mere half-hour of exposure to certain regions would deliver a dose of radiation sufficient to kill 50% of humans.[54]:A165 Although the area immediately surrounding the lake is devoid of population, the lake has the potential to dry up in times of drought. Most significantly, in 1967, it dried up and winds carried radioactive dust over thousands of square kilometers, exposing at least 500,000 citizens to a range of health risks.[54]:A165 To control dust, Soviet scientists piled concrete on top of the lake. Although this was effective in helping mediate the amount of dust, the weight of the concrete pushed radioactive materials into closer contact with standing underground groundwater.[54]:A166 It is difficult to gauge the overall health and environmental effects of the water contamination at Lake Karachay because figures on civilian exposure are unavailable, making it hard to show causation between elevated cancer rates and radioactive pollution specifically from the lake.\\r\\nContemporary efforts to manage radioactive contamination in the Soviet Union are few and far between. Public awareness of the past and present dangers, as well as the Russian government's investment in current cleanup efforts, are likely dampened by the lack of media attention STS and other sites have gotten in comparison to isolated nuclear incidents such as Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island.[55] The domestic government's investment in cleanup measures seems to be driven by economic concerns rather than care for public health. The most significant political legislation in this area is a bill agreeing to turn the already contaminated former weapons complex Mayak into an international radioactive waste dump, accepting cash from other countries in exchange for taking their radioactive byproducts of nuclear industry.[54]:A167 Although the bill stipulates that the revenue go towards decontaminating other test sites such as Semipalatinsk and the Kona Peninsula, experts doubt whether this will actually happen given the current political and economic climate in Russia.[54]:A168","input":"When did the soviets explode first atomic bomb?"},{"output":"hydrogen chloride","context":"Hydrochloric gas\\r\\nThe compound hydrogen chloride has the chemical formula HCl and as such is a hydrogen halide. At room temperature, it is a colorless gas, which forms white fumes of hydrochloric acid upon contact with atmospheric water vapor. Hydrogen chloride gas and hydrochloric acid are important in technology and industry. Hydrochloric acid, the aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride, is also commonly given the formula HCl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrogen chloride is a diatomic molecule, consisting of a hydrogen atom H and a chlorine atom Cl connected by a polar covalent bond. The chlorine atom is much more electronegative than the hydrogen atom, which makes this bond polar. Consequently, the molecule has a large dipole moment with a negative partial charge (Ѵ?) at the chlorine atom and a positive partial charge (Ѵ+) at the hydrogen atom.[8] In part because of its high polarity, HCl is very soluble in water (and in other polar solvents). It is polar covalent instead of Ionic because the differences in hydrogen and chlorines electronegativity is small enough that a complete ionic bond doesn't form. Any electronegativity between .6 and 1.67 creates a polar covalent bond.\\r\\nUpon contact, H2O and HCl combine to form hydronium cations H3O+ and chloride anions Cl? through a reversible chemical reaction:\\r\\nThe resulting solution is called hydrochloric acid and is a strong acid. The acid dissociation or ionization constant, Ka, is large, which means HCl dissociates or ionizes practically completely in water. Even in the absence of water, hydrogen chloride can still act as an acid. For example, hydrogen chloride can dissolve in certain other solvents such as methanol, protonate molecules or ions, and serve as an acid-catalyst for chemical reactions where anhydrous (water-free) conditions are desired.\\r\\nBecause of its acidic nature, hydrogen chloride is a corrosive substance, particularly in the presence of moisture.\\r\\nFrozen HCl undergoes phase transition at 98.4?K. X-ray powder diffraction of the frozen material shows that the material changes from an orthorhombic structure to a cubic one during this transition. In both structures the chlorine atoms are in a face-centered array. However, the hydrogen atoms could not be located.[9] Analysis of spectroscopic and dielectric data, and determination of the structure of DCl (deuterium chloride) indicates that HCl forms zigzag chains in the solid, as does HF (see figure on right).[10]\\r\\nThe infrared spectrum of gaseous hydrogen chloride, shown on the left, consists of a number of sharp absorption lines grouped around 2886?cm?1 (wavelength ~3.47?m). At room temperature, almost all molecules are in the ground vibrational state v?=?0. Including anharmonicity the vibrational energy can be written as.\\r\\nTo promote an HCl molecule from the v?=?0 to the v?=?1 state, we would expect to see an infrared absorption about o?=?e?+?2xee =?2880?cm?1. However, this absorption corresponding to the Q-branch is not observed due to it being forbidden by symmetry. Instead, two sets of signals (P- and R-branches) are seen owing to a simultaneous change in the rotational state of the molecules. Because of quantum mechanical selection rules, only certain rotational transitions are permitted. The states are characterized by the rotational quantum number J?= 0, 1, 2, 3, ... selection rules state that J is only able to take values of I1.\\r\\nThe value of the rotational constant B is much smaller than the vibrational one o, such that a much smaller amount of energy is required to rotate the molecule; for a typical molecule, this lies within the microwave region. However, the vibrational energy of HCl molecule places its absorptions within the infrared region, allowing a spectrum showing the rovibrational transitions of this molecule to be easily collected using an infrared spectrometer with a gas cell. The latter can even be made of quartz as the HCl absorption lies in a window of transparency for this material.\\r\\nNaturally abundant chlorine consists of two isotopes, 35Cl and 37Cl, in a ratio of approximately 3:1. While the spring constants are identical within experimental error, the reduced masses are different causing measurable differences in the rotational energy, thus doublets are observed on close inspection of each absorption line, weighted in the same ratio of 3:1.\\r\\nMost hydrogen chloride produced on an industrial scale is used for hydrochloric acid production.\\r\\nIn the chlor-alkali industry, brine (mixture of sodium chloride and water) solution is electrolyzed producing chlorine (Cl2), sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen (H2):\\r\\nThe pure chlorine gas can be combined with hydrogen to produce hydrogen chloride in the presence of UV light:\\r\\nAs the reaction is exothermic, the installation is called an HCl oven or HCl burner. The resulting hydrogen chloride gas is absorbed in deionized water, resulting in chemically pure hydrochloric acid. This reaction can give a very pure product, e.g. for use in the food industry.\\r\\nThe largest production of hydrochloric acid is integrated with the formation of chlorinated and fluorinated organic compounds, e.g., Teflon, Freon, and other CFCs, as well as chloroacetic acid and PVC. Often this production of hydrochloric acid is integrated with captive use of it on-site. In the chemical reactions, hydrogen atoms on the hydrocarbon are replaced by chlorine atoms, whereupon the released hydrogen atom recombines with the spare atom from the chlorine molecule, forming hydrogen chloride. Fluorination is a subsequent chlorine-replacement reaction, producing again hydrogen chloride:\\r\\nThe resulting hydrogen chloride gas is either reused directly or absorbed in water, resulting in hydrochloric acid of technical or industrial grade.\\r\\nSmall amounts of HCl gas for laboratory use can be generated in an HCl generator by dehydrating hydrochloric acid with either sulfuric acid or anhydrous calcium chloride. Alternatively, HCl can be generated by the reaction of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride:[12]\\r\\nThis reaction occurs at room temperature. Provided there is NaCl remaining in the generator and it is heated above 200?C, the reaction proceeds further:\\r\\nFor such generators to function, the reagents should be dry.\\r\\nHCl can also be prepared by the hydrolysis of certain reactive chloride compounds such as phosphorus chlorides, thionyl chloride (SOCl2), and acyl chlorides. For example, cold water can be gradually dripped onto phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) to give HCl:\\r\\nHigh-purity streams of the gas require lecture bottles or cylinders, both of which can be expensive. In comparison, the use of a generator requires only apparatus and materials commonly available in a laboratory.\\r\\nMost hydrogen chloride is used in the production of hydrochloric acid. It is also an important reagent in other industrial chemical transformations, e.g.:\\r\\nIn the semiconductor industry, it is used to both etch semiconductor crystals and to purify silicon via trichlorosilane (SiHCl3).\\r\\nIt may also be used to treat cotton to delint it, and to separate it from wool.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the laboratory, anhydrous forms of the gas are particularly useful for generating chloride-based Lewis acids, which must be absolutely dry for their Lewis sites to function. It can also be used to dry the corresponding hydrated forms of these materials by passing it over as they are heated; the materials would otherwise fume HCl gas themselves and decompose. Neither can these hydrates be dried using standard desiccator methods.\\r\\nAlchemists of the Middle Ages recognized that hydrochloric acid (then known as spirit of salt or acidum salis) released vaporous hydrogen chloride, which was called marine acid air. In the 17th century, Johann Rudolf Glauber used salt (sodium chloride) and sulfuric acid for the preparation of sodium sulfate, releasing hydrogen chloride gas (see production, below). In 1772, Carl Wilhelm Scheele also reported this reaction and is sometimes credited with its discovery. Joseph Priestley prepared hydrogen chloride in 1772, and in 1810 Humphry Davy established that it is composed of hydrogen and chlorine.[13]\\r\\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, demand for alkaline substances such as soda ash increased, and Nicolas Leblanc developed a new industrial-scale process for producing the soda ash. In the Leblanc process, salt was converted to soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, giving hydrogen chloride as by-product. Initially, this gas was vented to air, but the Alkali Act of 1863 prohibited such release, so then soda ash producers absorbed the HCl waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale. Later, the Hargreaves process was developed, which is similar to the Leblanc process except sulfur dioxide, water, and air are used instead of sulfuric acid in a reaction which is exothermic overall. In the early 20th century the Leblanc process was effectively replaced by the Solvay process, which did not produce HCl. However, hydrogen chloride production continued as a step in hydrochloric acid production.\\r\\nHistorical uses of hydrogen chloride in the 20th century include hydrochlorinations of alkynes in producing the chlorinated monomers chloroprene and vinyl chloride, which are subsequently polymerized to make polychloroprene (Neoprene) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), respectively. In the production of vinyl chloride, acetylene (C2H2) is hydrochlorinated by adding the HCl across the triple bond of the C2H2 molecule, turning the triple into a double bond, yielding vinyl chloride.\\r\\nThe \\"acetylene process\\", used until the 1960s for making chloroprene, starts out by joining two acetylene molecules, and then adds HCl to the joined intermediate across the triple bond to convert it to chloroprene as shown here:\\r\\nThis \\"acetylene process\\" has been replaced by a process which adds Cl2 to one of the double bonds in 1,3-butadiene instead, and subsequent elimination produces HCl instead, as well as chloroprene.\\r\\nHydrogen chloride forms corrosive hydrochloric acid on contact with water found in body tissue. Inhalation of the fumes can cause coughing, choking, inflammation of the nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract, and in severe cases, pulmonary edema, circulatory system failure, and death. Skin contact can cause redness, pain, and severe skin burns. Hydrogen chloride may cause severe burns to the eye and permanent eye damage.\\r\\nThe gas, being strongly hydrophilic, can be easily scrubbed from the exhaust gases of a reaction by bubbling it through water, producing useful hydrochloric acid as a byproduct.\\r\\nAny equipment handling hydrogen chloride gas must be checked on a routine basis; particularly valve stems and regulators. The gas requires the use of specialized materials on all wetted parts of the flow path, as it will interact with or corrode numerous materials hydrochloric acid alone will not; such as stainless and regular polymers.\\r\\nThe U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have established occupational exposure limits for hydrogen chloride at a ceiling of 5?ppm (7?mg/m3),[14] and compiled extensive information on hydrogen chloride workplace safety concerns.[15]","input":"What gas is given off by concentrated hydrochloric acid?"},{"output":"an advanced breed of orcs that serve Sauron and Saruman","context":"The Uruk-hai are fictional characters in J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth. They are introduced in The Lord of the Rings as an advanced breed of orcs that serve Sauron and Saruman. The first uruks appeared out of Mordor in attacks on Gondor in T.A.?2475.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"Uruk-hai\\" has the element Uruk, which is a Black Speech word related to Orc, related to the word \\"Urko\\" in Tolkien's invented language of Quenya. The element hai means \\"folk\\", so \\"Uruk-hai\\" is \\"Orc-folk\\". A similar term is \\"Olog-hai\\" (\\"troll-folk\\"), used for a breed of especially strong and vicious trolls capable of surviving sunlight.\\r\\nChristopher Tolkien describes \\"Uruks\\" as an anglicization of \\"Uruk-hai\\" and his father used the two terms interchangeably a number of times. While \\"Uruk-hai\\" means simply \\"Orc-folk\\", the term was reserved for the soldier orcs of Mordor and Isengard. The larger orcs called the smaller breeds snaga (\\"slave\\").\\r\\nThe Uruk-hai, described as large black orcs of great strength, first appeared from Mordor about the year 2475 of the Third Age, when they briefly took Ithilien and the city of Osgiliath. These original Uruks were of Sauron's breeding, but Saruman bred his own, which could endure sunlight. Due to their superior size and strength, the Uruk often looked down upon and bullied other breeds of orc.\\r\\nIn The Two Towers, Aragorn observes that the fallen Uruk-hai at Amon Hen had different gear than he had seen before: swords and bows like those of men, and shields and helmets set with the white hand and S-rune of Saruman.[2] Treebeard speculates that Saruman had crossbred Orcs and Men.[3] These orcs, who named themselves \\"the fighting Uruk-hai\\", made up a large part of Saruman's army, together with the Dunlendings and other human enemies of Rohan.[4][5] They were faster, stronger, and larger than normal orcs, and could travel during the day without being weakened, although they still did not like it.[3] Saruman fed them with human flesh.[6] Saruman's Uruk-hai fought against the Rohirrim at the Battles of the Fords of Isen, at the first of which King Thoden's son Thodred was killed, and at the Battle of the Hornburg, where the vast majority of the Uruks were defeated and destroyed.[5]\\r\\nThe chapter \\"The Uruk-hai\\" details some differences among the orcs. The raiding party included orcs from Mordor led by Grishnkh, Saruman's \\"fighting Uruk-hai\\" from Isengard led by Ugl~k, and \\"northerners\\", orcs from Moria. It was the dead Uruks from Isengard whom Aragorn found remarkable. The Uruk-hai of Isengard were the tallest of these orcs, and had large hands and thick legs. The orcs of Mordor were all long-armed and crook-legged, not as tall as the Isengarders but larger and more powerful than the orcs from Moria. The orcs of Moria in turn could see better in the dark than the Isengarders. Grishnkh from Mordor is described as \\"short\\" but \\"very broad\\". In The Return of the King the orcs Shagrat and Gorbag are identified as Uruks of Mordor.\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings describes several differences in the equipment and heraldry of Uruks and other orcs. Uruks and other orcs in the service of Barad-d?r used the symbol of the red Eye of Sauron. The orcs of Mordor referred to Sauron as the Great Eye, and the Red Eye was painted on their shields. In contrast, Aragorn comments that the Uruk-hai of Saruman were not equipped in the manner of other orcs at all: instead of curved scimitars, they used short broad-bladed swords; and they wore iron helms marked with the Elf-rune  which had the value of \\"S\\". It was clear the \\"S\\" stood for Saruman, considering Sauron's general desire not to have his name written or spoken. Saruman's Uruks used black shields emblazoned with a white hand, a symbol of Saruman.\\r\\nThe book speculates that Saruman commands various hybrids of Orcs and Men, including in the Shire. Some of these, called \\"half-orcs\\" in The Two Towers, were sallow-skinned, squint-eyed, and as tall as men. Merry describes them as \\"horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces\\". An account of the first Battle of the Fords of Isen in Unfinished Tales clearly treats Uruk-hai and \\"orc-men\\" separately.\\r\\nIn Morgoth's Ring, Tolkien states that Saruman did interbreed orcs and men, resulting in \\"Man-orcs large and cunning, and Orc-men treacherous and vile.\\" However, the relationship of the Uruk-hai, as well as half-orcs and \\"goblin-men\\", to these creatures is not made explicit.[7]\\r\\nIn Ralph Bakshi's animated The Lord of the Rings, differences between Orc kinds are not noted, though there are recurring physical and costume variations.\\r\\nIn Peter Jackson's film trilogy, Saruman's Uruk-hai are bred from pits beneath Isengard and when the time is \\"right\\" they are dug up by lesser orcs working for Saruman, who are occasionally killed by the newborn Uruks. Jackson's depiction of the Uruks being spawned from the mud came from Tolkien's old description of orcs being \\"bred from the heats and slimes of the earth.\\" It is said they were a result of cross-breeding orcs and \\"Goblin-men\\", instead of Orcs and Men. In Tolkien's writings \\"Goblin\\" is just another term for orc.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe film versions of the Uruk-hai tend to be tall, broad, burly and with long black hair. They usually wield hooked broadswords and pikes. The first of them is Lurtz, an original character, who is the first of Saruman's Uruk-hai to be bred and leads the raiding party that ambush the Fellowship of the Ring at Amon Hen, where Lurtz himself fatally wounds Boromir before being slain in turn by Aragorn. The Uruks are also shown to use crossbows at Helm's Deep, though Tolkien does not mention the weapon in the book. Berserker Uruks were also used during the siege of Helm's Deep, both to clear the ramparts of defenders and to detonate explosive mines to breach the deeping wall. These Uruks were very tall, wore no armour and were prepared for battle (and most likely death) by donning helmets filled with the blood of their enemy.\\r\\nSauron is shown to have bred his own Uruk-hai, known as Black Uruks.

The ribbon is awarded to graduates of Air Force basic training who have obtained an honor graduate designation and demonstrate excellence in all areas of academic and military training.[5]\\r\\nAn airman must achieve at least a 90% on his/her physical fitness level during the final AFBMT physical fitness test. The AFBMT physical fitness test has four parts: 1.5-mile run time (60%), number of sit ups in a minute (10%), number of push ups in a minute (10%), and waist measurement (20%). If the trainee fails to reach a score of at least 90%, the airman is ineligible no matter how well he or she performed in other areas of basic training. Additionally, the airman must average over a 90 percent on all the written examinations, and never fail a graded inspection (graded inspections are conducted randomly after week #3). The airman must never receive a negative mark in a written evaluation. Current regulations limit the number of selectees to no more than ten percent of the graduating squadron.[6]\\r\\nThe U.S. Air Force Basic Military Training Honor Graduate Ribbon is a one-time award and may not be presented retroactively.

He led the Mavericks to their first NBA Finals appearance and to three consecutive 50+ win seasons. During his playing days, Johnson was known as the \\"Little General\\" for his small stature (by NBA standards), his leadership skills as a point guard (floor general), and his close friendship with former San Antonio Spurs teammate David Robinson - himself nicknamed \\"The Admiral\\" based on his tenure at the Naval Academy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a high school senior in 1983, Johnson led New Orleans' St. Augustine High School to a 35ÿ0 record and the Class 4A Louisiana State Championship. Johnson matriculated at New Mexico Junior College before moving on to Cameron University, and finally Southern University, at which in his senior season in 1988 he led NCAA Division I with 13.3 assists per game, an all-time record.[1] In that season, he also averaged 11.4 points per game, making him the first men's Division I player ever to average double figures in points and assists in the same seasona feat that was not duplicated until Jason Brickman of LIU Brooklyn did so in 2013ÿ14.[2]\\r\\nUpon graduation in 1988, Johnson was not selected in the NBA draft.[3]\\r\\nJohnson spent the summer of 1988 with Palm Beach Stingrays of the United States Basketball League. In 43 games, Johnson averaged 1.6 points and 1.7 assists as a reserve. Johnson also played in six playoff games for the Stingrays.[4]\\r\\nIn the 1989ÿ90 season, Johnson played 53 games with 10 starts for the Seattle SuperSonics. He made 18 assists on January 5, 1990 against the Miami Heat.[4]\\r\\nOn October 24, 1990, the SuperSonics traded Johnson to the Denver Nuggets for a conditional pick in the 1997 NBA draft. After playing 21 games, Johnson was waived from the Nuggets in December before signing with the San Antonio Spurs on January 17, 1991. Johnson played 47 games with seven starts for the Spurs and averaged 9.4 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists.[4]\\r\\nIn the beginning of the 1991ÿ92 season, Johnson played 20 games and averaged 5.0 points and 6.8 assists for the Spurs before being waived in December. On January 10, 1992, Johnson signed the first of several 10-day contracts with the Houston Rockets that preceded a longer-term contract. Johnson scored a career-high 22 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves on January 28.[4]\\r\\nSigned as an unrestricted free agent, Johnson returned to the Spurs on November 19, 1992. Promoted to starter, Johnson averaged 8.7 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 7.5 assists and improved his field goal percentage to .502 in 75 games. In the playoffs, Johnson averaged 8.2 points and 8.1 assists.[4]\\r\\nJohnson signed with the Golden State Warriors on October 25, 1993 and was named team captain just nine days into his signing. Starting 70 of 82 games, Johnson reached a new career high 10.9 points per game along with 5.3 assists per game.[4]\\r\\nJohnson is best known for his time with the Spurs from 1994 to 2001, and particularly his integral role on the 1998ÿ99 Spurs team that won the NBA championship against the New York Knicks. Most notably, Johnson made the go-ahead, championship-clinching shot in Game 5 on a jumper with 47 seconds remaining in the game.[5] The Spurs retired Johnson's number 6 on December 22, 2007.[6] He was also inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame on February 20, 2009.[7]\\r\\nOn July 19, 2001, Johnson signed as a free agent with the Denver Nuggets. Johnson played 51 games (13 starts) with the Nuggets and averaged 9.4 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 5.1 assists.[8] The Nuggets traded Johnson and three other players to the Dallas Mavericks on February 21, 2002. Johnson played 17 games all as a reserve with the Mavericks for the rest of the season.[8]\\r\\nIn the 2002ÿ03 season, Johnson played in 48 games as a reserve for the Mavericks, averaging 9.0 minutes per game. Johnson ended his NBA career in the 2003ÿ04 season back with the Golden State Warriors. He played 46 games with one start and averaged 4.6 points, 0.7 rebounds, and 2.4 assists.[8]\\r\\nOn October 28, 2004, Johnson retired from playing and signed as an assistant coach with the Dallas Mavericks under Don Nelson. Johnson had played under Nelson from 2001 to 2003, and it was understood from the beginning that he was being groomed to eventually succeed Nelson as head coach. His transition from assistant to head coach came five months later on March 19, 2005, after Nelson resigned.\\r\\nUnder Johnson, the Mavericks closed out the 2004ÿ05 season with a 16ÿ2 run and a first-round playoff victory over the Houston Rockets, before being eliminated by the Phoenix Suns in the second round of the playoffs. Johnson was named the April 2005 NBA Coach of the Month, only one month after becoming a head coach for the first time.\\r\\nThe 2005ÿ06 season was even more successful for Johnson and was marked by a series of milestones. In November 2005, Johnson won his second NBA Coach of the Month award (which was also his second consecutive award, following the one he had won in April the previous season), making him the first NBA coach to win the award in his first two months as a head coach. On January 28, 2006, when the Dallas Mavericks defeated the Utah Jazz, Johnson's record as head coach improved to 50ÿ12, making Johnson the fastest coach to reach 50 wins. In February 2006, he was chosen to coach the 2006 NBA All-Star team for the Western Conference. Although Johnson ultimately led the Mavericks to the second-best record in the Western Conference, the team entered the playoffs as the fourth seed in the West due to the structure of the 2006 NBA Playoffs seeding. In April 2006, Johnson was rewarded for his success throughout the season with the 2006 NBA Coach of the Year Award.\\r\\nIn June 2006, after defeating the Memphis Grizzlies, the defending champion San Antonio Spurs, and the Phoenix Suns in the first three rounds of the playoffs, Johnson led the Mavericks to their first ever NBA Finals appearance. However, the Mavs were defeated in six games by the Miami Heat, losing four straight after winning the first two games.\\r\\nOn December 31, 2006, Johnson became the fastest head coach (at the time) to win 100 games when his squad defeated the Denver Nuggets. This record was later broken by Tom Thibodeau and the Chicago Bulls. In the 2006ÿ07 season, Johnson's Mavericks had the best record in the NBA with 67 wins and entered the playoffs as the top seed. However, his Mavericks lost to the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors, led by former Mavericks head coach Don Nelson, in one of the biggest upsets in recent NBA history.\\r\\nWith the Mavs' win over the Grizzlies on November 18, 2007, Johnson became the fastest coach to reach 150 wins. Following the 2007ÿ08 season, the Mavericks under Johnson were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the second year in a row. A day later, on April 30, 2008, Johnson was dismissed as head coach of the Mavericks.[9][10][11]\\r\\nOn October 17, 2008, Johnson joined ESPN as a studio analyst. He remained in that role for two seasons, until he received an offer to become head coach of the New Jersey Nets.[12]\\r\\nOn June 10, 2010, Johnson was hired as head coach of the New Jersey Nets,[13] which had just finished a dismal 2009ÿ10 campaign with a 12ÿ70 record. In his first year as coach of the Nets, the team improved slightly, doubling its win total from the previous season and finishing 24ÿ58. However, the next year saw no such improvement, as his team went 22ÿ44 in the lockout-shortened season.\\r\\nJohnson remained with the Nets when the team moved to Brooklyn in 2012. He was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for October and November 2012 following an 11ÿ4 start to the season. Despite that early success, the team went on to lose ten of its next 13 games, and subsequently Johnson was fired from his head coaching position on December 27, 2012.[14][15]\\r\\nIn 2013, Johnson rejoined ESPN to appear as an analyst on SportsCenter, NBA Coast to Coast, and NBA Tonight.[16]\\r\\nOn April 5, 2015, ESPN reported that Johnson had verbally agreed to become the new head basketball coach at the University of Alabama, replacing Anthony Grant.[17] The following day, the university officially announced Johnson's hiring as the school's 21st men's basketball coach.[18]\\r\\nJohnson and his wife Cassandra have two children, Avery Jr. and Christianne.[19] Avery Jr. is currently playing for the Alabama basketball team, coached by his father.[20]\\r\\n??????National champion?? ??????Postseason invitational champion??\\r\\n??????Conference regular season champion?? ??????Conference regular season and conference tournament champion\\r\\n??????Division regular season champion ??????Division regular season and conference tournament champion\\r\\n??????Conference tournament champion\\r\\n(#) denotes interim head coach.\\r\\n(#) denotes interim head coach.\\r\\n# denotes interim head coach","input":"Who is the head basketball coach at alabama?"},{"output":"a business practice that involves managing and optimizing the purchase, deployment, maintenance, utilization, and disposal of software applications within an organization","context":"Software asset management (SAM) is a business practice that involves managing and optimizing the purchase, deployment, maintenance, utilization, and disposal of software applications within an organization. According to the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), SAM is defined as all of the infrastructure and processes necessary for the effective management, control and protection of the software assetsthroughout all stages of their lifecycle.[1] Fundamentally intended to be part of an organizations information technology business strategy, the goals of SAM are to reduce information technology (IT) costs and limit business and legal risk related to the ownership and use of software, while maximizing IT responsiveness and end-user productivity.[2] SAM is particularly important for large corporations in regard to redistribution of licenses and managing legal risks associated with software ownership and expiration. SAM technologies track license expiration, thus allowing the company to function ethically and within software compliance regulations. This can be important for both eliminating legal costs associated with license agreement violations and as part of a company's reputation management strategy. Both are important forms of risk management and are critical for large corporations' long-term business strategies.\\r\\nSAM is one facet of a broader business discipline known as IT asset management, which includes overseeing both software and hardware that comprise an organizations computers and network.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSAM can serve many different functions within organizations, depending on their software portfolios, IT infrastructures, resource availability, and business goals.\\r\\nFor many organizations, the goal of implementing a SAM program is very tactical in nature, focused specifically on balancing the number of software licenses purchased with the number of actual licenses consumed or used. In addition to balancing the number of licenses purchased with the amount of consumption, an effective SAM program must also ensure that the usage of all installed software is in keeping with the terms and conditions of the specific vendor license agreement. In doing so, organizations can minimize liabilities associated with software piracy in the event of an audit by a software vendor or a third party such as the Business Software Alliance (BSA). SAM, according to this interpretation, involves conducting detailed software inventories on a periodic basis to determine the exact number of software licenses consumed, comparing this information with the number of licenses purchased, reviewing how the software is being used in respect to the terms and conditions and establishing controls to ensure that proper licensing practices are maintained on an ongoing basis. This can be accomplished through a combination of IT processes, purchasing policies and procedures, and technology solutions such as software inventory tools.[3]\\r\\nCounting installations is the most common means of measuring license consumption but some software is licensed by number of users, capital, processors or CPU Cores.\\r\\nMore broadly defined, the strategic goals of SAM often include (but are not limited to) the following:\\r\\nA number of technologies are available to support key SAM processes:\\r\\nThe latest version of the SAM standard from ISO is 19770-1:2012. This revised standard is designed to allow the implementation of SAM processes to be \\"accomplished in multiple staged increments or tiers.\\"[7] Part 1 of the standard details SAM processes including control environment, planning and implementation, inventory, verification and compliance, operations management and life cycle. In 2003, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) began working with the SAM industry to develop a standard of best practices for software asset management programs. Standard ISO/IEC 19770-1:2006, Information technology ÿ software asset management ÿ Part 1, was published by the ISO and IEC in May 2006.[8]\\r\\nISO/IEC 19770-2:2015: Software identification tag;[9] establishes specifications for tagging software to optimize its identification and management. The current version was published in 2015 and is a revision to the 2009 original Software ID Tag standard.[10] Using software identification tags or SWID tags makes discovery a simpler and more accurate process that can be verified by software vendors if they audit an organisations entire estate. SWID tags are implemented and supported by many vendors including IBM, Microsoft and Adobe.\\r\\nISO/IEC 19770-3:2016: Entitlement Management Schema [11] outlines a technical schema which can be used to encapsulate license details including contract information, entitlements, rights, limitations and details about invoice, PO numbers, etc. This is currently at FDIS (Final Draft International Standard) stage and was published in April of 2016.\\r\\nISO 55000:2014 [12] is the new international standard for asset management and was ratified in January 2014. It provides an overview of asset management, its principles and terminology, and the expected benefits from adopting a comprehensive asset management strategy. This standardisation is driving increased interest in the whole asset management market, including asset management software, and is particularly interesting to asset-intensive organisations including Utilities, Chemical and Transport companies. 19770-1 is aligned with this standard.\\r\\nISO 55000:2014 can be applied to all types of assets and by all types and sizes of organization. It is intended to be used for managing physical assets in particular, but it can also be applied to other asset types. By itself it does not cover many of the requirements for IT and Software Asset Management, such as licensing, and the additional controls which are needed in general for software (e.g. for access and integrity), and for complex control situations such as SaaS and BYOD. These additional requirements are being incorporated in edition 3 of ISO/IEC 19770-1 which is based on ISO 55000:2014. Publication is not likely until 2017.\\r\\nAn example of issues faced when scaling up discovery tools is with Microsoft's System Centre Configuration Manager (SCCM). Using SCCM Metering Rules to monitor software usage across a small estate or a small number of applications is relatively easy and reliable given the total number of unique executables (.exe files) and the number of instances of each executable. Turning on Metering Rules for every packaged application and every executable in a large estate quickly makes the volume of data generated unmanageable and expensive to maintain. Most SAM tools which consume SCCM data rely on these Metering Rules to understand usage.","input":"What is software asset management (sam)?"},{"output":"a field grade military officer rank just above the rank of major and just below the rank of colonel","context":"In the United States Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Air Force, a lieutenant colonel is a field grade military officer rank just above the rank of major and just below the rank of colonel. It is equivalent to the naval rank of commander in the other uniformed services.\\r\\nThe pay grade for the rank of lieutenant colonel is O-5. In the United States armed forces, the insignia for the rank consists of a silver oak leaf, with slight stylized differences between the Army/Air Force version and the Navy/Marine Corps version.\\r\\nPromotion to lieutenant colonel is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) of 1980 for officers in the Active Component and its companion Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA) for officers in the Reserve Component (e.g., Reserve and National Guard). DOPMA guidelines suggest 70% of majors should be promoted to lieutenant colonel after serving a minimum of three years at their present rank and after attaining 15ÿ17 years of cumulative commissioned service.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile often written as \\"Lt. Colonel\\" in orders and signature blocks, as a courtesy, lieutenant colonels are addressed simply as \\"colonel\\" verbally and in the salutation of correspondence. The U.S. Army uses the three letter abbreviation \\"LTC.\\" The United States Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force use the abbreviations \\"LtCol\\" and \\"Lt? Col\\" (note the space) respectively.\\r\\nThe U.S. Government Printing Office recommends the abbreviation \\"LTC\\" for U.S. Army usage, \\"LtCol\\" for Marine Corps usage, and \\"Lt.?Col.\\" for the Air Force.[1] The Associated Press Stylebook recommends the abbreviation \\"Lt.?Col.\\" for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force.[2]\\r\\nSlang terms for the rank historically used by the U.S. military include \\"light colonel\\", \\"short colonel\\", \\"light bird\\", \\"half colonel\\", \\"bottlecap colonel\\" (referring to the silver oak leaf insignia), and \\"telephone colonel\\" (from self-reference as \\"colonel\\" when using a telephone).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe rank of lieutenant colonel has existed in the British Army since at least the 16th century and was used in both American colonial militia and colonial regular regiments.[3] The Continental Army continued the British and colonial use of the rank of lieutenant colonel,[4] as the second-in-command to a colonel commanding a regiment.[5] The lieutenant colonel was sometimes known as \\"lieutenant to the colonel.\\"\\r\\nIn British practice, regiments were actually commanded by their lieutenant colonels, as the colonel was a titular position [6] (with the incumbent absent from the regiment serving as a senior staff officer, a general officer, or as a member of the nobility). Since the British colonel was not a \\"combat\\" officer, beginning in May 1778 to simplify prisoner of war exchanges, American regiments began to eliminate colonels by attrition and replace them with a lieutenant colonel commandant. The conversion was never completely effected and some regiments remained commanded by colonels throughout the war.[7] From 1784 until 1791, there was only one lieutenant colonel in the US Army (Josiah Harmar), who acted as the army's commanding officer.\\r\\nIn the Continental Army aides to the Commander in Chief, viz., Lieutenant General George Washington, were lieutenant colonels. Additionally, certain officers serving under the Adjutant General, Inspector General, and Judge Advocate General, ranked as lieutenant colonels.[8]\\r\\nDuring the 19th century, lieutenant colonel was often a terminal rank for many officers, since the rank of \\"full colonel\\" was considered extremely prestigious reserved only for the most successful officers. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, the rank of lieutenant colonel became much more common and was used as a \\"stepping stone\\" for officers who commanded small regiments or battalions and were expected, by default, to be promoted to full colonel once the manpower of a regiment grew in strength. Such was the case of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who commanded a Maine regiment as both a lieutenant colonel and later as a colonel.\\r\\nAfter the Civil War ended, those officers remaining in the United States Armed Forces found lieutenant colonel to again be a terminal rank, although many lieutenant colonels were raised to higher positions in a brevet status. Such was the case with George A. Custer, who was a lieutenant colonel in the regular army, but held the brevet rank of major general.[9][10]\\r\\nThe 20th century saw lieutenant colonel in its present-day status although, during the 1930s, many officers again found the rank to be terminal as the rank of colonel was reserved for only a select few officers.\\r\\nIn the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps (USMC), a lieutenant colonel typically commands a battalion/squadron-sized unit (300 to 1,200 Soldiers/Marines), with a major as executive officer (XO) and a command sergeant major/sergeant major (USMC) as principal NCO or senior enlisted adviser (SEA). A lieutenant colonel may also serve as a brigade/brigade combat team, regiment/regimental combat team, Marine Aviation Group (MAG), Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), or battalion task force executive officer. Lieutenant colonels routinely serve as principal staff officers, under a colonel as chief of staff, on a general staff (\\"G\\" staff) of a division, Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), or Marine Logistics Group (MLG). These staff positions may include: G-1 (administration and personnel), G-2 (intelligence), G-3 (operations), G-4 (logistics), G-5 (civil/military affairs), or G-6 (computers and communications). Usage of \\"The G-n\\" may refer to either a specific staff section or the staff officer leading a section. Lieutenant colonels may also be junior staff at a variety of higher echelons.\\r\\nIn the United States Air Force, a lieutenant colonel is generally a squadron commander in the operations group, mission support and maintenance groups, or a squadron commander or division chief in a medical group. Lieutenant colonels may also serve on general staffs and may be the heads of some wing staff departments. Senior Lieutenant colonels occasionally serve as group commanders.\\r\\nIn US Army and Air Force ROTC detachments, the commanding officer is typically a lieutenant colonel, along with several majors, captains, and non-commissioned officers serving as assistants. However, some detachments are commanded by full colonels.\\r\\nThe rank of lieutenant colonel is also used by many large American police departments for officers in senior administrative positions. The rank is not always called \\"lieutenant colonel,\\" and in many cases ÿ particularly with municipal police agencies ÿ an alternate term such as \\"assistant chief\\" or \\"commander\\" is used, and only the insignia is retained. In some organizations, however, especially state police agencies, both the title and insignia are used. Occasionally, the rank is used in conjunction with, rather than instead of, an official title. For example, in the Texas Department of Public Safety, the head of the agency's patrol division is titled \\"Chief of the Highway Patrol\\", but holds the rank of a lieutenant colonel: this figure is thus referred to as \\"lieutenant colonel,\\" not \\"chief\\".","input":"What rank is lieutenant colonel in the army?"},{"output":"agreement to eliminate or reduce the trade barriers","context":"The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA; Spanish: rea de Libre Comercio de las Amricas, ALCA; French: Zone de libre-change des Amriques, ZLA; Portuguese: rea de Livre Comrcio das Amricas, ALCA; Dutch: Vrijhandelszone van Amerika) was a proposed agreement to eliminate or reduce the trade barriers among all countries in the Americas, excluding Cuba.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the latest round of negotiations, trade ministers from 34 countries met in Miami, Florida, in the United States, in November 2003 to discuss the proposal.[1] The proposed agreement was an extension of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Opposing the proposal were Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Dominica, and Nicaragua (all of which entered the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas in response), and Mercosur member states. Discussions have faltered over similar points as the Doha Development Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) talks; developed nations seek expanded trade in services and increased intellectual property rights, while less developed nations seek an end to agricultural subsidies and free trade in agricultural goods. Similar to the WTO talks, Brazil has taken a leadership role among the less developed nations, while the United States has taken a similar role for the developed nations.\\r\\nFree Trade Area of the Americas began with the Summit of the Americas in Miami, Florida, on December 11, 1994, but the FTAA came to public attention during the Quebec City Summit of the Americas, held in Canada in 2001, a meeting targeted by massive anti-corporatization and anti-globalization protests. The Miami negotiations in 2003 met similar protests, though perhaps not as large.\\r\\nIn previous negotiations, the United States had pushed for a single comprehensive agreement to reduce trade barriers for goods, while increasing intellectual property protection. Specific intellectual property protections could include Digital Millennium Copyright Act-style copyright protections similar to the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Another protection would likely restrict the reimportation or cross-importation of pharmaceuticals, similar to the proposed agreement between the United States and Canada. Brazil proposed a three-track approach that calls for a series of bilateral agreements to reduce specific tariffs on goods, a hemispheric pact on rules of origin, and a dispute resolution process; Brazil proposed to omit the more controversial issues from the FTAA, leaving them to the WTO.\\r\\nThe location of the FTAA Secretariat was to have been determined in 2005. The contending cities are: Atlanta, Chicago, Galveston, Houston, San Juan, and Miami in the United States; Canc~n and Puebla in Mexico; Panama City, Panama; and Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The U.S. city of Colorado Springs also submitted its candidacy in the early days but subsequently withdrew.[2] Miami, Panama City and Puebla served successively as interim secretariat headquarters during the negotiation process.\\r\\nThe last summit was held at Mar del Plata, Argentina, in November 2005, but no agreement on FTAA was reached. Of the 34 countries present at the negotiations, 26 pledged to meet again in 2006 to resume negotiations, but no such meeting took place. The failure of the Mar del Plata summit to establish a comprehensive FTAA agenda augured poorly.\\r\\nThe FTAA missed the targeted deadline of 2005, which followed the stalling of useful negotiations of the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005.[3] Over the next few years, some governments, most notably the United States, not wanting to lose any chance of hemispheric trade expansion moved in the direction of establishing a series of bilateral trade deals. The leaders however, planned further discussions at the Sixth Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, in 2012.[4][5]\\r\\nThe following countries are in the plans of the Free Trade Area of the Americas:[6]\\r\\nA vocal critic of the FTAA was Venezuelan president Hugo Chvez, who has described it as an \\"annexation plan\\" and a \\"tool of imperialism\\" for the exploitation of Latin America.[7] As a counterproposal to this initiative, Chvez promoted the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (Alianza Bolivariana para las Amricas, ALBA), based mostly on the model of the Eurasian Economic Community, which emphasizes energy and infrastructure agreements that are gradually extended to other areas finally to include the total economic, political and military integration of the member states.[7] Evo Morales of Bolivia has referred to the U.S.-backed Free Trade Area of the Americas, as \\"an agreement to legalize the colonization of the Americas\\".[8]\\r\\nOn the other hand, the then presidents of Brazil, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, and Argentina, Nstor Kirchner, have stated that they do not oppose the FTAA but they do demand that the agreement provide for the elimination of U.S. agriculture subsidies, the provision of effective access to foreign markets and further consideration towards the needs and sensibilities of its members.[9]\\r\\nOne of the most contentious issues of the treaty proposed by the United States is with concerns to patents and copyrights. Critics claim that if the measures proposed by the United States were implemented and applied this would reduce scientific research in Latin America. On the left-wing Council of Canadians web site, Barlow wrote: \\"This agreement sets enforceable global rules on patents, copyrights and trademark. It has gone far beyond its initial scope of protecting original inventions or cultural products and now permits the practice of patenting plants and animal forms as well as seeds.

The flag itself is a vertical tricolour of green (at the hoist), white and orange.[1][2] The proportions of the flag are 1:2 (that is to say, flown horizontally, the flag is half as high as it is wide).\\r\\n\\r\\nPresented as a gift in 1848 to Thomas Francis Meagher from a small group of French women sympathetic to the Irish cause,[3][4] it was intended to symbolise the inclusion and hoped-for union between Roman Catholics and Protestants, the significance of the colours outlined by Meagher was, The white in the centre signifies a lasting truce between Orange and Green and I trust that beneath its folds the hands of Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until the Easter Rising of 1916, when it was raised above Dublin's General Post Office by Gear܇id O'Sullivan,[5] that the tricolour came to be regarded as the national flag.[6] The flag was adopted by the Irish Republic during the Irish War of Independence (1919ÿ1921). The flag's use was continued by the Irish Free State (1922ÿ1937) and it was later given constitutional status under the 1937 Constitution of Ireland. The tricolour is used by nationalists on both sides of the border as the national flag of the whole island of Ireland since 1916.[7] Thus it is flown by many nationalists in Northern Ireland as well as by the Gaelic Athletic Association.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn relation to the national flag of Ireland, the Constitution of Ireland simply states in Article 7:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe national flag is the tricolour of green, white and orange.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs there are no further statutory requirements in relation to the flag, the Department of the Taoiseach takes general responsibility for matters relating to the flag. In its advisory role, the department has issued guidelines to assist persons in their use of the national flag.[10] The flag should be rectangular in shape and its length should be two times its width, translating into an aspect ratio of 1:2. The three coloured pales? green, white and orange? should be of equal size, and vertically disposed.\\r\\nThe precise colours of the flag as set by the Department of the Taoiseach are:[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag should normally be displayed on a flagstaff, with the green pale positioned next to the flagstaff, at the hoist; the white pale positioned in the centre; and the orange pale positioned at the fly, farthest from the flagstaff. Provided that the correct proportions are observed, the flag may be made to any convenient size.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe green pale of the flag symbolises Roman Catholics, the orange represents the minority Protestants who were supporters of William of Orange, who had defeated King James II and his predominantly Irish Catholic army[14] at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.[15] His title came from the Principality of Orange in the south of France that had been a Protestant bastion from the 16th century. It was included in the Irish flag in an attempt to reconcile the Orange Order in Ireland with the Irish independence movement.[citation needed] The white in the centre signifies a lasting peace and hope for union between Protestants and Catholics in Ireland.[16] The flag, as a whole, is intended to symbolise the inclusion and hoped-for union of the people of different traditions on the island of Ireland, which is expressed in the Constitution as the entitlement of every person born in Ireland to be part of the independent Irish nation, regardless of ethnic origin, religion or political conviction.[17][18]\\r\\nThere are exceptions to the general beneficent theory. Green was also used as the colour of such Irish bodies as the mainly-Protestant and non-sectarian Friendly Brothers of St. Patrick, established in 1751.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally, differing shades of yellow, instead of orange, are seen at civilian functions. However the Department of the Taoiseach state that this is a misrepresentation which \\"should be actively discouraged\\",[6] and that worn-out flags should be replaced.[19] In songs and poems, the colours are sometimes enumerated as \\"green, white and gold\\", using poetic licence.[20][21] Variants of different guises are utilised to include, for example, various emblems of Ireland, such as the presidential harp, the four provinces or county arms.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nA green flag featuring a harp is described as being used by Owen Roe O'Neill in 1642.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 18th century green had become associated as the colour of revolution. The United Irishmen, founded in the 1790s, were inspired by the French revolution, and used a green flag, to which they had a harp emblazoned.[24] A rival organisation, the Orange Order, whose main strength was in Ulster, and which was exclusively for Protestants, especially members of the Anglican Church of Ireland, was founded in 1795 in memory of King William of Orange and the \\"Glorious Revolution\\" of 1688. Following the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which pitted the \\"green\\" tradition of the republican United Irishmen against the \\"orange\\" tradition of Anglican Protestant Ascendancy loyal to the British Crown, the ideal of a later nationalist generation in the mid-19th century was to make peace between the two traditions and, if possible, to found a self-governing Ireland on such peace and union.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest known reference to the use of the three colours of green, white and orange as a nationalist emblem dates from September 1830 when tricolour cockades were worn at a meeting held to celebrate the French Revolution of that year? a revolution which restored the use of the French tricolour.[25] The colours were also used in the same period for rosettes and badges, and on the banners of trade guilds.[25] However, widespread recognition was not accorded to the flag until 1848. At a meeting in his native city of Waterford on 7 March 1848, Thomas Francis Meagher, the Young Ireland leader, first publicly unveiled the flag from a second-floor window of the Wolfe Tone Club as he addressed a gathered crowd on the street below who were present to celebrate another revolution that had just taken place in France.[25][26] It was inspired by the tricolour of France. Speeches made at that time by Meagher suggest that it was regarded as an innovation and not as the revival of an older flag.[25] From March of that year Irish tricolours appeared side-by-side with French ones at meetings held all over the country.[17] John Mitchel, referring to the tricolour of green, white and orange that Meagher had presented from Paris at a later meeting in Dublin on 15 April 1848, said: \\"I hope to see that flag one day waving, as our national banner\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the tricolour was not forgotten as a symbol of the ideal of union and a banner associated with the Young Irelanders and revolution, it was rarely used between 1848 and 1916. Even up to the eve of the Easter Rising of 1916, the green flag featuring a harp held undisputed sway.[17] Neither the colours nor the arrangement of the early tricolours were standardised. All of the 1848 tricolours showed green, white and orange, but orange was sometimes put next to the staff, and in at least one flag the order was orange, green and white.[17] In 1850 a flag of green for the Roman Catholics, orange for the Protestants of the Established Church and blue for the Presbyterians was proposed.[17] In 1883, a Parnellite tricolour of yellow, white and green, arranged horizontally, was recorded. Down to modern times, yellow has occasionally been used instead of orange, but by this substitution the fundamental symbolism is destroyed.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAssociated with separatism in the past, flown during the Easter Rising of 1916 and capturing the national imagination as the banner of the new revolutionary Ireland,[27] the tricolour came to be acclaimed throughout the country as somewhat of a national flag. To many Irish people, though, it was considered to be a \\"Sinn Fin flag\\".[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Irish Free State which existed between 1922 and 1937, the flag was adopted by the Executive Council. The Free State constitution did not specify national symbols; the decision to use the flag was made without recourse to statute. When the Free State joined the League of Nations in September 1923, the new flag \\"created a good deal of interest amongst the general public\\" in Geneva.[29] The defeated republicans who had fought the Free State's forces in the 1922ÿ23 Civil War regarded the tricolour as the flag of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic, and condemned its appropriation by the new state, as expressed in the song \\"Take It Down From The Mast\\". The Executive Council's decision was a provisional one.[25] A 1928 British document said:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government in Ireland have taken over the so called Free State Flag in order to forestall its use by republican element and avoid legislative regulation, to leave them free to adopt a more suitable emblem later.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937, the tricolour's position as the national flag was formally confirmed by the new Constitution of Ireland.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pre-independence Merchant Shipping Act 1894 was not repealed, and so the Free State's mercantile marine was technically required to fly the Red Ensign.[31] The collier Glenageary may have been the first to arrive in a British port flying the tricolour on 8 December 1921 (two days after the treaty). This flag along with a model of the Glenageary is on display in the National Maritime Museum of Ireland. While some ships, such as the cross-channel ferries flew the red ensign, others sailed under the tricolour.[32][33][34] Some masters of Irish ships were charged by the British Customs and fined by courts for flying an \\"improper ensign\\".[35] The tricolour was flown by the fisheries patrol vessel Muirch~, precursor to the Irish Naval Service; Frank Carney alleged in the Dil in 1930 that a trespassing French trawler had refused to surrender to  because it did not recognise Muirch~'s flag.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIrish-register ships could fly the Red Ensign until September 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, when a decree under the state of emergency was made, to ensure neutral Irish ships were not mistaken for British ships.[31] Some ships flying the tricolour were nevertheless sunk by Germans.[36] When the tricolour was hoisted over the passenger ferries in Holyhead their British crews went on strike. Five days later their owners transferred the ferries to the British register and the Red Ensign was restored.[37] On the other hand, the Belfast to Liverpool ferry, British owned and British crewed, used the tricolour as a flag of convenience;[38] so did the whalers of Christian Salvesen Shipping, to take advantage of the Irish whale quota.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tricolour's marine status was formalised by the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947.[31][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1921, Ireland was partitioned, with the unionist-dominated north-east becoming Northern Ireland, while later, in 1922, the remainder of Ireland left the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to form the Irish Free State.[41] Northern Ireland continued to use the UK's Union Flag and created its Ulster Banner derivation of the flag of Ulster with a crown on top of a six-pointed star.[42] Furthermore, for many years the tricolour was effectively banned in Northern Ireland under the Flags and Emblems (Display) Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 which empowered the police to remove any flag that could cause a breach of the peace but specified, rather controversially, that a Union Flag could never have such an effect.[43] In 1964, the enforcement of this law by the Royal Ulster Constabulary at the behest of Ian Paisley, involving the removal of a single tricolour from the offices of Sinn Fin in Belfast, led to two days of rioting. The tricolour was immediately replaced, highlighting the difficulty of enforcing the law.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its original symbolism, in Northern Ireland the tricolour, along with most other markers of either British or Irish identity, has come to be a symbol of division.[42] The Ulster Unionist Party Government of Northern Ireland adopted the Ulster Banner (based on the flag of Ulster) in 1953.[45] Thus it is this flag and the Union Flag that are flown by unionists and loyalists, while the tricolour is flown by nationalists and republicans.[42] In Northern Ireland, each community uses its own flags, murals and other symbols to declare its allegiance and mark its territory, often in a manner that is deliberately provocative.[46] Kerb-stones in unionist and loyalist areas are often painted red, white and blue,[47] while in nationalist and republican areas kerb-stones may be painted green, white and orange, although this is a much less frequent occurrence.[48] Elements of both communities fly \\"their\\" flag from chimneys, tall buildings and lamp-posts on roads.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the 1998 Good Friday or Belfast Agreement, it was recognised that flags continue to be a source of disagreement in Northern Ireland. The Agreement stated that:\\r\\n\\r\\nAll participants acknowledge the sensitivity of the use of symbols and emblems for public purposes, and the need in particular in creating the new institutions to ensure that such symbols and emblems are used in a manner which promotes mutual respect rather than division.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnionists argue that the recognition of the principle of consent in the Agreement? that Northern Ireland's constitutional status cannot change without a majority favouring it? by the signatories amounts to recognising that the Union Flag is the only legitimate official flag in Northern Ireland.[51][52][53] Nationalists maintain that the Agreement means that the use of the Union Flag for official purposes should be restricted, or that the tricolour should be flown alongside the UK's flag on government buildings.[54] However the tricolour is never flown from official buildings, alone or alongside the UK's flag. A Sinn Fin Lord Mayor of Belfast, Alex Maskey, displayed both flags in his own offices causing some controversy.[55][56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department of the Taoiseach has issued guidelines to assist persons in giving due respect to the national flag. Observance of the guidelines is a matter for each individual as there are no statutory requirements. It is expected, however, that the national flag will be treated at all times with appropriate respect by those who use it. The Department has general responsibility in relation to the national flag and this is primarily concerned with the protocol for the flying of the flag. The Department's role, therefore, is an advisory one.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to the display, placing and precedence of the national flag by both itself and in relation to other flags, the Department has made a number of suggestions. No flag or pennant should be flown above the national flag. When the flag is carried with another flag, or flags, it should be carried in the place of honour? that is on the marching right, or on the left of an observer towards whom the flags are approaching. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be carried on the immediate left of the national flag, or, as seen by an observer when the flags are approaching, on the immediate right of the national flag. In the event of a display of crossed staffs, the national flag should be to the right and to the fore? that is to the left of the observer who is facing the flag. Its staff should be in front of the other flag or flags.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the group of flags of the European Union are flown, the sequence is alphabetical, based on the first letter of the country's name. The flags should be flown from left to right with the European Union flag flown from the first flagstaff before the group. An alternative order of flags is to begin on the left with the national flag and place the European Union flag on the far right of the group, as seen by an observer.[58] With regard to international flags; where either an even or an odd number of flags are flown in line on staffs of equal height, the national flag should be first on the right of the line? that is on the observer's left as he or she faces the flags. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown on the immediate left of the national flag, or as seen by an observer, on the immediate right of the national flag. Where, however, an odd number of flags are displayed from staffs grouped so that there is one staff in the centre and higher than the others, the national flag should be displayed from the staff so placed. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown from the first flagstaff on the right, or as seen by an observer, on the first flagstaff on the left. Only one national flag should be displayed in each group of flags or at each location. In all cases, the national flag should be in the place of honour. When the national flag is displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall or other background, the green should be on the right (an observer's left) in the horizontal position or uppermost in the vertical position. When displayed on a platform, the national flag should be above and behind the speaker's desk. While being carried, the flag should not be dipped by way of salute or compliment except to the dead during memorial ceremonies.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn raising or lowering, the national flag should not be allowed to touch the ground. When being hoisted to half-mast, the flag should first be brought to the peak of the staff and then lowered to the half-mast position.[59] It should again be brought to the peak of the staff before it is finally lowered.[60] On ceremonial occasions when the national flag is being hoisted or lowered, or when it is passing by in a parade, all present should face it, stand to attention and salute. Persons in uniform who normally salute with the hand should give the hand salute. Persons in civilian attire should salute by standing to attention. The salute to the flag when it is being borne past in a parade is rendered when the flag is six paces away and the salute is held until the flag has passed by. Where more than one national flag is carried, the salute should be given only to the leading flag.[61] When the national anthem is played in the presence of the national flag, all present should face the national flag, stand to attention and salute it, remaining at the salute until the last note of the music.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the national flag has become worn or frayed it is no longer fit for display, and should not be used in any manner implying disrespect.[62] The national flag, when used as a decoration, should always be treated with due respect. It may be used as a discreet lapel button or rosette or as part of a centrepiece for a table. When used in the latter context with the flags of other nations, the national flag should also be displayed in the place of honour on a nearby flag staff. Where multiple national flags are flown on festive occasions these should be of uniform dimensions. Bunting of the national colours may also be used on festive occasions.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe national flag should be displayed in the open only between sunrise and sunset, except on the occasion of public meetings, processions, or funerals, when it may be displayed for the duration of such functions.[63][64] When displayed on a platform, the national flag should not be used to cover the speakers desk, nor should it be draped over the platform. The national flag should never be defaced by placing slogans, logos, lettering or pictures of any kind on it, for example at sporting events. The flag should not be draped on cars, trains, boats or other modes of transport; it should not be carried flat, but should always be carried aloft and free, except when used to drape a coffin; on such an occasion, the green should be at the head of the coffin. The tricolour is draped across the coffins of Presidents of Ireland (including former presidents), soldiers and Garda Sochna personnel killed in the line of duty, and other notables accorded state funerals, such as Roger Casement in 1965, or Kevin Barry in 2001. Care should be taken at all times to ensure that the national flag does not touch the ground, trail in water or become entangled in trees or other obstacles.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the normal practice to fly the national flag daily at all military posts and from a limited number of important State buildings. The European flag is flown alongside the national flag on all official buildings, and in most places where the Irish flag is flown over buildings. The national flag is flown over buildings including: the residence of the President of Ireland, ras an Uachtarin; Leinster House, the seat of the Irish parliament, when parliament is in session; Irish courts and state buildings; Irish military installations, at home and abroad; and Garda Sochna (police) stations. The national flag is also flown on Saint Patrick's Day (the national holiday), Easter Sunday and Easter Monday (in commemoration of the Easter Rising of 1916), and the National Day of Commemoration on the Sunday closest to 11 July. On these occasions the national flag is flown from all State buildings throughout the country which are equipped with flagpoles, and many private individuals and concerns also fly it. The national flag is flown on the occasion of other significant national and local events such as festivals and commemorations. The national flag is frequently flown at half-mast on the death of a national or international figure on all prominent government buildings equipped with a flag pole. The death of a prominent local figure may be marked locally by the national flag being flown at half-mast. Where the national flag is flown at half-mast no other flag should be half-masted.[66]","input":"Who has a green white and orange flag?"},{"output":"European Communities","context":"Between 1993 and 2009, the European Union (EU) legally comprised three pillars. This structure was introduced with the Treaty of Maastricht on 1 November 1993, and was eventually abandoned on 1 December 2009 upon the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, when the EU obtained a consolidated legal personality.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin each pillar, a different balance was struck between the supranational and intergovernmental principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupranationalism was strongest in the first pillar. Its function generally corresponded at first to the three European Communities (European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), European Economic Community (EEC) and Euratom) whose organisational structure had already been unified in 1965-67, through the Merger Treaty. Later, through the Treaty of Maastricht the word \\"Economic\\" was removed from the EEC, so it became simply the EC. Then with the Treaty of Amsterdam additional areas would be transferred from the third pillar to the first. In 2002, the ECSC (which had a lifetime of 50 years) ceased to exist because the treaty which established it, the Treaty of Paris, had expired.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the CFSP and PJCCM pillars the powers of the European Parliament, the Commission and European Court of Justice with respect to the Council were significantly limited, without however being altogether eliminated. The balance struck in the first pillar was frequently referred to as the \\"community method\\", since it was that used by the European Community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pillar structure had its historical origins in the negotiations leading up to the Maastricht treaty. It was desired to add powers to the Community in the areas of foreign policy, security and defence policy, asylum and immigration policy, criminal co-operation, and judicial co-operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, some member-states opposed the addition of these powers to the Community on the grounds that they were too sensitive to national sovereignty for the community method to be used, and that these matters were better handled intergovernmentally. To the extent that at that time the Community dealt with these matters at all, they were being handled intergovernmentally, principally in European Political Cooperation (EPC).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, these additional matters were not included in the European Community; but were tacked on externally to the European Community in the form of two additional 'pillars'. The first additional pillar (Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP) dealt with foreign policy, security and defence issues, while the second additional pillar (JHA, Justice and Home Affairs), dealt with the remainder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmendments by the treaty of Amsterdam and the treaty of Nice made the additional pillars increasingly supranational. Most important among these were the transfer of policy on asylum, migration and judicial co-operation in civil matters to the Community pillar, effected by the Amsterdam treaty. Thus the third pillar was renamed Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters, or PJCCM. The term Justice and Home Affairs was still used to cover both the third pillar and the transferred areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a speech before the Nice Conference, Joschka Fischer, then Foreign Minister of Germany, called for a simplification of the European Union. One of these core ideas was to abolish the pillar structure, and replace it with a merged legal personality for the Union. This idea was included in the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009. With a legal personality, Union is, for instance, able to be part of international treaties. The Treaty of Lisbon also states that \\"the Union shall replace and succeed the European Community,\\" with the effect that, once the Treaty entered into force, the EU obtained the membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which had belonged to the European Communities pillar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abolition of the \\"3-pillar structure\\" was welcomed by practitioners and academics who had long considered the 'pillar metaphor\\" to be unrealistic, if not absurd.  The idea that one pillar could be the Communities, while the other two were merely \\"policies\\" or \\"cooperation\\" was scarcely credible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Lisbon Treaty the distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union was reorganised into the following scheme:","input":"What are the 3 pillars of the eu?"},{"output":"macOS","context":"macOS (pronounced /?m?ko???s/;[6] previously Mac OS X and later OS X) is the current series of Unix-based graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. designed to run on Apple's Macintosh computers (\\"Macs\\"). It has been preinstalled on all Macs since 2002. Within the market of desktop, laptop and home computers, and by web usage, it is the second most widely used desktop OS after Microsoft Windows.[7][8]\\r\\nLaunched in 2001 as Mac OS X, the series is the latest in the family of Macintosh operating systems. Mac OS X succeeded \\"classic\\" Mac OS, which was introduced in 1984, and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999. An initial, early version of the system, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was released in 1999. The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, followed in March 2001. Releases were code named after big cats from the original release up until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Beginning in 2013 with OS X 10.9 Mavericks, releases have been named after landmarks in California.[9] Apple changed the original name \\"Mac OS X\\" to \\"OS X\\" in 2012 and then to \\"macOS\\" in 2016, adopting the nomenclature that it uses for their other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The latest version of macOS is macOS 10.12 Sierra, which was publicly released in September 2016.\\r\\nmacOS is based on technologies developed at NeXT between 1985 and 1997, when Apple acquired the company. The \\"X\\" in Mac OS X and OS X is pronounced \\"ten\\", as it is the Roman numeral for the number 10. The X was a prominent part of the operating system's brand identity, and was used to showcase its Unix compatibility; UNIX 03 certification was achieved for the Intel version of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard[10] and all releases from Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard up to the current version also have UNIX 03 certification.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17] macOS shares its Unix-based core, named Darwin, and many of its frameworks with iOS,[18] tvOS and watchOS. A heavily modified version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was used for the first-generation Apple TV.[19]\\r\\nApple also used to have a separate line of releases of Mac OS X designed for servers. Beginning with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, the server functions were made available as a separate package on the Mac App Store.\\r\\nReleases of Mac OS X from 1999 to 2005 can run only on the PowerPC-based Macs from the time period. After Apple announced that they were switching to Intel CPUs from 2006 onwards, a separate version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was made and distributed exclusively with early Intel-based Macs; it included an emulator known as Rosetta, which allowed users to run most PowerPC applications on Intel-based Macs. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released as a Universal binary, meaning the installer disc supported both Intel and PowerPC processors. In 2009, Apple released Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, which ran exclusively on Intel-based Macs. In 2011, Apple released Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, which no longer supported 32-bit Intel processors and also did not include Rosetta. All versions of the system released since then run exclusively on 64-bit Intel CPUs and do not support PowerPC applications.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in 1985. There, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed, and then launched in 1989. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of BSD. Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.\\r\\nThroughout the early 1990s, Apple had tried to create a \\"next-generation\\" OS to succeed its classic Mac OS through the Taligent, Copland and Gershwin projects, but all of them were eventually abandoned.[20] This led Apple to purchase NeXT in 1996, allowing NeXTSTEP, then called OPENSTEP, to serve as the basis for Apple's next generation operating system.[21] This purchase also led to Steve Jobs returning to Apple as an interim, and then the permanent CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple's primary market of home users and creative professionals. The project was first code named \\"Rhapsody\\" and then officially named Mac OS X.[22][23]\\r\\nMac OS X was originally presented as the tenth major version of Apple's operating system for Macintosh computers; current versions of macOS retain the major version number \\"10\\". Previous Macintosh operating systems (versions of the classic Mac OS) were named using Arabic numerals, e.g. Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9. The letter \\"X\\" in Mac OS X's name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral. It is therefore correctly pronounced \\"ten\\" /?t?n/ in this context.[24][25] However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter \\"X\\" /??ks/.[26]\\r\\nThe first version of Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was a transitional product, featuring an interface resembling the classic Mac OS, though it was not compatible with software designed for the older system. Consumer releases of Mac OS X included more backward compatibility. Mac OS applications could be rewritten to run natively via the Carbon API; many could also be run directly through the Classic Environment with a reduction in performance.\\r\\nThe consumer version of Mac OS X was launched in 2001 with Mac OS X 10.0. Reviews were variable, with extensive praise for its sophisticated, glossy Aqua interface but criticizing it for sluggish performance.[27] With Apple's popularity at a low, the makers of several classic Mac applications such as FrameMaker and PageMaker declined to develop new versions of their software for Mac OS X.[28] Ars Technica columnist John Siracusa, who reviewed every major OS X release up to 10.10, described the early releases in retrospect as 'dog-slow, feature poor' and Aqua as 'unbearably slow and a huge resource hog'.[27][29][30]\\r\\nApple rapidly developed several new releases of Mac OS X.[31] Siracusa's review of version 10.3, Panther, noted \\"It's strange to have gone from years of uncertainty and vaporware to a steady annual supply of major new operating system releases.\\"[32] Version 10.4, Tiger, reportedly shocked executives at Microsoft by offering a number of features, such as fast file searching and improved graphics processing, that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with acceptable performance.[33]\\r\\nAs the operating system evolved, it moved away from the classic Mac OS, with applications being added and removed.[34] Considering music to be a key market, Apple developed the iPod music player and music software for the Mac, including iTunes and GarageBand.[35] Targeting the consumer and media markets, Apple emphasized its new \\"digital lifestyle\\" applications such as the iLife suite, integrated home entertainment through the Front Row media center and the Safari web browser. With increasing popularity of the internet, Apple offered additional online services, including the .Mac, MobileMe and most recently iCloud products. It later began selling third-party applications through the Mac App Store.\\r\\nNewer versions of Mac OS X also included modifications to the general interface, moving away from the striped gloss and transparency of the initial versions. Some applications began to use a brushed metal appearance, or non-pinstriped titlebar appearance in version 10.4.[36] In Leopard, Apple announced a unification of the interface, with a standardized gray-gradient window style.[37][38]\\r\\nIn 2006, the first Intel Macs released used a specialized version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.[39] In 2007, Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was the first to run on both PowerPC and Intel Macs with the use of universal binaries.[40] Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was the first version of OS X to drop support for PowerPC Macs.[41]\\r\\nA key development for the system was the announcement and release of the iPhone from 2007 onwards. While Apple's previous iPod media players used a minimal operating system, the iPhone used an operating system based on Mac OS X, which would later be called \\"iPhone OS\\" and then iOS. The simultaneous release of two operating systems based on the same frameworks placed tension on Apple, which cited the iPhone as forcing it to delay Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.[42] However, after Apple opened the iPhone to third-party developers its commercial success drew attention to Mac OS X, with many iPhone software developers showing interest in Mac development.[43]\\r\\nIn two succeeding versions, Lion and Mountain Lion, Apple moved some applications to a highly skeuomorphic style of design inspired by contemporary versions of iOS, at the same time simplifying some elements by making controls such as scroll bars fade out when not in use.[29] This direction was, like brushed metal interfaces, unpopular with some users, although it continued a trend of greater animation and variety in the interface previously seen in design aspects such as the Time Machine backup utility, which presented past file versions against a swirling nebula, and the glossy translucent dock of Leopard and Snow Leopard.[44] In addition, with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple ceased to release separate server versions of Mac OS X, selling server tools as a separate downloadable application through the Mac App Store. A review described the trend in the server products as becoming \\"cheaper and simpler... shifting its focus from large businesses to small ones.\\"[45]\\r\\nIn 2012, with the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the name of the system was shortened from Mac OS X to OS X. That year, Apple removed the head of OS X development, Scott Forstall, and design was changed towards a more minimal direction.[46] Apple's new user interface design, using deep color saturation, text-only buttons and a minimal, 'flat' interface, was debuted with iOS 7 in 2013. With OS X engineers reportedly working on iOS 7, the version released in 2013, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, was something of a transitional release, with some of the skeuomorphic design removed, while most of the general interface of Mavericks remained unchanged.[47] The next version, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, adopted a design similar to iOS 7 but with greater complexity suitable for an interface controlled with a mouse.[48]\\r\\nFrom 2012 onwards, the system has shifted to an annual release schedule similar to that of iOS. It also steadily cut the cost of updates from Snow Leopard onwards, before removing upgrade fees altogether from 2013 onwards.[49] Some journalists and third-party software developers have suggested that this decision, while allowing more rapid feature release, meant less opportunity to focus on stability, with no version of OS X recommendable for users requiring stability and performance above new features.[50] Apple's 2015 update, OS X 10.11 El Capitan, was announced to focus specifically on stability and performance improvements.[51]\\r\\nIn 2016, with the release of macOS 10.12 Sierra, the name was changed from OS X to macOS to streamline it with the branding of Apple's other primary operating systems: iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.[52]\\r\\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra's main features are the introduction of Siri to macOS, Optimized Storage, improvements to included applications, and greater integration with Apple's iPhone and Apple Watch. The Apple File System was announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2016 as a replacement for HFS Plus, a highly criticized file system. This new file system will be implemented at a later date.[53]\\r\\nAt the 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference Apple previewed macOS 10.13 High Sierra.\\r\\nAt macOS's core is a POSIX compliant operating system built on top of the XNU kernel, with standard Unix facilities available from the command line interface. Apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named Darwin. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the Aqua interface and the Finder, to complete the GUI-based operating system which is macOS.[54]\\r\\nWith its original introduction as Mac OS X, the system brought a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, the classic Mac OS. For example, pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system's ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other.[55] Many aspects of macOS's architecture are derived from OPENSTEP, which was designed to be portable, to ease the transition from one platform to another. For example, NeXTSTEP was ported from the original 68k-based NeXT workstations to x86 and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple,[56] and OPENSTEP was later ported to the PowerPC architecture as part of the Rhapsody project.\\r\\nThe default macOS file system is HFS+, which it inherited from the classic Mac OS. Operating system designer Linus Torvalds has criticized HFS+, saying it is \\"probably the worst file system ever\\", whose design is \\"actively corrupting user data\\". He criticized the case insensitivity of file names, a design made worse when Apple extended the file system to support Unicode.[57][58] Initially, HFS+ was designed for classic Mac OS, which runs on big-endian 68K and PowerPC systems. When Apple switched Macintosh to little-endian Intel processors, it continued to use big-endian byte order on HFS+ file systems. As a result, macOS on current Macs must do byte swap when it reads file system data.[59][60] These concerns are being addressed with the new Apple File System, which will be included in a later update.\\r\\nThe Darwin subsystem in macOS is in charge of managing the file system, which includes the Unix permissions layer. In 2003 and 2005, two Macworld editors expressed criticism of the permission scheme; Ted Landau called misconfigured permissions \\"the most common frustration\\" in macOS, while Rob Griffiths suggested that some users may even have to reset permissions every day, a process which can take up to 15 minutes.[61] More recently, another Macworld editor, Dan Frakes, called the procedure of repairing permissions vastly overused.[62] He argues that macOS typically handles permissions properly without user interference, and resetting permissions should just be tried when problems emerge.[63]\\r\\nThe architecture of macOS incorporates a layered design:[64] the layered frameworks aid rapid development of applications by providing existing code for common tasks.[65] Apple provides its own software development tools, most prominently an integrated development environment called Xcode. Xcode provides interfaces to compilers that support several programming languages including C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift. For the AppleÿIntel transition, it was modified so that developers could build their applications as a universal binary, which provides compatibility with both the Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macintosh lines.[66] First and third-party applications can be controlled programatically using the AppleScript framework,[67] retained from the classic Mac OS,[68] or using the newer Automator application that offers pre-written tasks that do not require programming knowledge.[69]\\r\\nApple offered two main APIs to develop software natively for macOS: Cocoa and Carbon. Cocoa was a descendant of APIs inherited from OPENSTEP with no ancestry from the classic Mac OS, while Carbon was an adaptation of classic Mac OS APIs, allowing Mac software to be minimally rewritten in order to run natively on Mac OS X.\\r\\nThe Cocoa API was created as the result of a 1993 collaboration between NeXT Computer and Sun Microsystems. This heritage is highly visible for Cocoa developers, since the \\"NS\\" prefix is ubiquitous in the framework, standing variously for NeXTSTEP or NeXT/Sun. The official OPENSTEP API, published in September 1994, was the first to split the API between Foundation and ApplicationKit and the first to use the \\"NS\\" prefix.[56] Traditionally, Cocoa programs have been mostly written in Objective-C, with Java as an alternative. However, on July 11, 2005, Apple announced that \\"features added to Cocoa in Mac OS X versions later than 10.4 will not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface.\\"[79] macOS also used to support the Java Platform as a \\"preferred software package\\"in practice this means that applications written in Java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being cross-platform compatible, and that graphical user interfaces written in Swing look almost exactly like native Cocoa interfaces. Since 2014, Apple has promoted its new programming language Swift as the preferred language for software development on Apple platforms.\\r\\nApple's original plan with macOS was to require all developers to rewrite their software into the Cocoa APIs. This caused much outcry among existing Mac developers, who threatened to abandon the platform rather than invest in a costly rewrite, and the idea was shelved.[23][80] To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, the Carbon Application Programming Interface (API) was created.[23] Applications written with Carbon were initially able to run natively on both classic Mac OS and Mac OS X, although this ability was later dropped as Mac OS X developed. Carbon was not included in the first product sold as Mac OS X: the little-used original release of Mac OS X Server 1.0, which also did not include the Aqua interface.[81] Apple limited further development of Carbon from the release of Leopard onwards, announcing Carbon applications would not receive the ability to run at 64-bit.[80] As of 2015, a small number of older Mac OS X apps with heritage dating back to the classic Mac OS still used Carbon, including Microsoft Office. Early versions of macOS could also run some classic Mac OS applications through the Classic Environment with performance limitations; this feature was removed from 10.5 onwards and all Macs using Intel processors.\\r\\nBecause macOS is POSIX compliant, many software packages written for the other Unix-like systems such as Linux can be recompiled to run on it, including much scientific and technical software.[82] Third-party projects such as Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts and pkgsrc provide pre-compiled or pre-formatted packages. Apple and others have provided versions of the X Window System graphical interface which can allow these applications to run with an approximation of the macOS look-and-feel.[83][84][85] The current Apple-endorsed method is the open-source XQuartz project; earlier versions could use the X11 application provided by Apple, or before that the XDarwin project.[86]\\r\\nApplications can be distributed to Macs and installed by the user from any source and by any method such as downloading (with or without code signing, available via an Apple developer account) or through the Mac App Store, a marketplace of software maintained by Apple by way of a process requiring the company's approval. Apps installed through the Mac App Store run within a sandbox, restricting their ability to exchange information with other applications or modify the core operating system and its features. This has been cited as an advantage, by allowing users to install apps with confidence that they should not be able to damage their system, but also as a disadvantage, by blocking the Mac App Store's use by professional applications that require elevated privileges.[87][88] Applications without any code signature cannot be run by default except from a computer's administrator account.[89][90]\\r\\nApple produces macOS applications, some of which are included and some sold separately. This includes iWork, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, iLife, and the database application FileMaker. Numerous other developers also offer software for macOS.\\r\\nTools such as XPostFacto and patches applied to the installation media have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of macOS on systems not officially supported by Apple. This includes a number of pre-G3 Power Macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, all G3-based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger, and sub-867?MHz G4 Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac's Open Firmware interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a clock rate of 867?MHz or greater. Except for features requiring specific hardware (e.g. graphics acceleration or DVD writing), the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware.\\r\\nAs most Mac hardware components, or components similar to those, since the Intel transition are available for purchase,[94] some technology-capable groups have developed software to install macOS on non-Apple computers. These are referred to as Hackintoshes, a portmanteau of the words \\"hack\\" and \\"Macintosh\\". This violates Apple's EULA (and is therefore unsupported by Apple technical support, warranties etc.), but communities that cater to personal users, who do not install for resale and profit, have generally been ignored by Apple.[95][96][97] These self-made computers allow more flexibility and customization of hardware, but at a cost of leaving the user more responsible for their own machine, such as on matter of data integrity or security.[98] Psystar, a business that attempted to profit from selling macOS on non-Apple certified hardware, was sued by Apple in 2008.[99]\\r\\nIn April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on Intel x86 processors. The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform.[100] These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal[101] and CNET,[102] announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months.[103][104][105]\\r\\nOn June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs announced in his keynote address at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that Apple would be making the transition from PowerPC to Intel processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life. Intel-based Macs would run a new recompiled version of OS X along with Rosetta, a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines.[106] The system was included with Mac OS X versions up to version 10.6.8.[107] Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II and SheepShaver provided support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying command-line compilers supported building universal binaries that would run on either architecture.[108]\\r\\nPowerPC-only software is supported with Apple's official emulation software, Rosetta, though applications eventually had to be rewritten to run properly on the newer versions released for Intel processors. Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both PowerPC and Intel.[109] There is a performance penalty when PowerPC binaries run on Intel Macs through Rosetta. Moreover, some PowerPC software, such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins, are not supported on Intel Macs at all. Some PowerPC applications would not run on macOS at all. Plugins for Safari need to be compiled for the same platform as Safari, so when Safari is running on Intel, it requires plug-ins that have been compiled as Intel-only or universal binaries, so PowerPC-only plug-ins will not work.[110] While Intel Macs are able to run PowerPC, Intel, and universal binaries; PowerPC Macs support only universal and PowerPC builds.\\r\\nSupport for the PowerPC platform was dropped following the transition. In 2009, Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference that Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard would drop support for PowerPC processors and be Intel-only.[111] Rosetta continued to be offered as an optional download or installation choice in Snow Leopard before it was discontinued with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.[112][112] In addition, new versions of Mac OS X first- and third-party software increasingly required Intel processors, including new versions of iLife, iWork, Aperture and Logic Pro.\\r\\nOne of the major differences between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology.[113] ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals.[114] Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.\\r\\nThe use of soft edges, translucent colors, and pinstripes, similar to the hardware design of the first iMacs, brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X Server 1.0's \\"Platinum\\" appearance had offered. According to John Siracusa, an editor of Ars Technica, the introduction of Aqua and its departure from the then conventional look \\"hit like a ton of bricks.\\"[115] Bruce Tognazzini (who founded the original Apple Human Interface Group) said that the Aqua interface in Mac OS X 10.0 represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original Mac OS interface.[116][117] Third-party developers started producing skins for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the Aqua appearance. To some extent, Apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage, at various times threatening legal action against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its copyrighted design.[118]\\r\\nApple has continued to change aspects of the macOS appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar. Since 2012, Apple has sold many of its Mac models with high-resolution Retina displays, and macOS and its APIs have extensive support for resolution-independent development on supporting high-resolution displays. Reviewers have described Apple's support for the technology as superior to that on Windows.[119][120][121]\\r\\nThe human interface guidelines published by Apple for macOS are followed by many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts.[122] In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, making it easy to output PDF to multiple devices.[114] As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features.[123] Reflecting its popularity with design users, macOS also has system support for a variety of professional video and image formats and includes an extensive pre-installed font library, featuring many prominent brand-name designs.[124]\\r\\nThe Finder is a file browser allowing quick access to all areas of the computer, which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of macOS.[125][126] Quick Look is part of the Finder since version 10.5. It allows for dynamic previews of files, including videos and multi-page documents without opening any other applications. Spotlight, a file searching technology which has been integrated into the Finder since version 10.4, allows rapid real-time searches of data files; mail messages; photos; and other information based on item properties (metadata) and/or content.[127][128] macOS makes use of a Dock, which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows.\\r\\nApple added \\"Expos\\" in version 10.3 (called Mission Control since version 10.7), a feature which includes three functions to help accessibility between windows and desktop. Its functions are to instantly display all open windows as thumbnails for easy navigation to different tasks, display all open windows as thumbnails from the current application, and hide all windows to access the desktop.[129] Also, FileVault was introduced, which is an optional encryption of the user's files with the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128).[130]\\r\\nFeatures introduced in version 10.4 include Automator, an application designed to create an automatic workflow for different tasks;[131] Dashboard, a full-screen group of small applications called desktop widgets that can be called up and dismissed in one keystroke;[132] and Front Row, a media viewer interface accessed by the Apple Remote.[133] Moreover, the Sync Services were included, which is a system that allows applications to access a centralized extensible database for various elements of user data, including calendar and contact items. The operating system then managed conflicting edits and data consistency.[134]\\r\\nAll system icons are scalable up to 512G512 pixels as of version 10.5 to accommodate various places where they appear in larger size, including for example the Cover Flow view, a three-dimensional graphical user interface included with iTunes, the Finder, and other Apple products for visually skimming through files and digital media libraries via cover artwork. That version also introduced Spaces, a virtual desktop implementation which enables the user to have more than one desktop and display them in an Expos-like interface;[135] an automatic backup technology called Time Machine, which provides the ability to view and restore previous versions of files and application data;[136] and Screen Sharing was built in for the first time.[137]\\r\\nIn more recent releases, Apple has developed support for emoji characters by including the proprietary Apple Color Emoji font.[138][139] Apple has also connected macOS with social networks such as Twitter and Facebook through the addition of share buttons for content such as pictures and text.[140] Apple has brought several applications and features that originally debuted in iOS, its mobile operating system, to macOS in recent releases, notably the intelligent personal assistant Siri, which was introduced in version 10.12 of macOS.[141][142]\\r\\nThere are 34 system languages available in macOS for the user at the moment of installation; the system language is used throughout the entire operating system environment.[5] Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language.[143] Recent updates have added increasing support for Chinese characters and interconnections with popular social networks in China.[144][145][146][147]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS can be updated using the Mac App Store application[148] or the softwareupdate command line utility. Until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, a separate Software Update application performed this functionality. In Mountain Lion and later, this was merged into the Mac App Store application, although the underlying update mechanism remains unchanged and is fundamentally different than the download mechanism used when purchasing an App Store application.\\r\\nWith the exception of Mac OS X Server 1.0 and the original public beta, OS X versions were named after big cats until OS X 10.9 Mavericks, when Apple switched to using California locations. Prior to its release, Mac OS X 10.0 was code named \\"Cheetah\\" internally at Apple, and Mac OS X 10.1 was code named internally as \\"Puma\\". After the immense buzz surrounding Mac OS X 10.2, codenamed \\"Jaguar\\", Apple's product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system. Mac OS X 10.3 was marketed as \\"Panther\\", Mac OS X 10.4 as \\"Tiger\\", Mac OS X 10.5 as \\"Leopard\\", Mac OS X 10.6 as \\"Snow Leopard\\", Mac OS X 10.7 as \\"Lion\\", OS X 10.8 as \\"Mountain Lion\\", and OS X 10.9 as \\"Mavericks\\".\\r\\n\\"Panther\\", \\"Tiger\\" and \\"Leopard\\" are registered as trademarks of Apple,[167][168][169] but \\"Cheetah\\", \\"Puma\\" and \\"Jaguar\\" have never been registered. Apple has also registered \\"Lynx\\" and \\"Cougar\\" as trademarks, though these were allowed to lapse.[170][171] Computer retailer Tiger Direct sued Apple for its use of the name \\"Tiger\\". On May 16, 2005 a US federal court in the Southern District of Florida ruled that Apple's use did not infringe on Tiger Direct's trademark.[172]\\r\\nOn September 13, 2000, Apple released a $29.95[173] \\"preview\\" version of Mac OS X internally codenamed Kodiak in order to gain feedback from users.\\r\\nThe \\"PB\\" as it was known marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in Spring 2001.[174]\\r\\nOn March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).[175] The initial version was slow,[176] incomplete,[177] and had very few applications available at the time of its launch, mostly from independent developers.[citation needed] While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve.[177] Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment,[177] for attempts to completely overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks. Following some bug fixes, kernel panics became much less frequent.[citation needed]\\r\\nLater that year on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released. It featured increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users, in addition to the US$129 boxed version for people running Mac OS 9. It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS 9 systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs in an actual stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems.[178] On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.[179]\\r\\nOn August 23, 2002,[180] Apple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.[181] It brought great raw performance improvements, a sleeker look, and many powerful user-interface enhancements (over 150, according to Apple[182] ), including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16?MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and an instant messaging client named iChat.[183] The Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X v10.2.[184]\\r\\nMac OS X v10.3 Panther was released on October 24, 2003. In addition to providing much improved performance, it also incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface. Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Expos (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added videoconferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability.[185] Support for some early G3 computers such as \\"beige\\" Power Macs and \\"WallStreet\\" PowerBooks was discontinued.[186]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger was released on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features.[187] As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256?MB and a built-in FireWire port.[93] Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.[188]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released on October 26, 2007. It was called by Apple \\"the largest update of Mac OS X\\". It brought more than 300 new features.[189] Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for the G3 processor was dropped and the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867?MHz, and at least 512?MB of RAM to be installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines). New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed,[190] full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features. Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification.[10][191] Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications.[192] It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture.[193]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, Snow Leopard focused on \\"under the hood\\" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser. Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1?GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).[194]\\r\\nSnow Leopard also featured new 64-bit technology capable of supporting greater amounts of RAM, improved support for multi-core processors through Grand Central Dispatch, and advanced GPU performance with OpenCL.[195]\\r\\nAn update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple's digital distribution platform for macOS applications.[196]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.7 Lion was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications called Launchpad and a greater use of multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. This release removed Rosetta, making it incompatible with PowerPC applications.[112]\\r\\nChanges made to the GUI include auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used, and Mission Control which unifies Expos, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface.[197] Apple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed, similar to iOS. Documents auto-save by default.[198]\\r\\nOS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012.[161] Following the release of Lion the previous year, it was the first of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely alined with the annual iOS operating system updates. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud.[199] Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen. Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine, QQ, 163.com and 126.com services for Mail, Contacts and Calendar, Youku, Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share sheets.[147]\\r\\nStarting with Mountain Lion, Apple software updates (including the OS) are distributed via the App Store.[200] This updating mechanism replaced the Apple Software Update utility.[201]\\r\\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013. It was a free upgrade to all users running Snow Leopard or later with a 64-bit Intel processor.[202] Its changes include the addition of the previously iOS-only Maps and iBooks applications, improvements to the Notification Center, enhancements to several applications, and many under-the-hood improvements.[203]\\r\\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite was released on October 16, 2014. It features a redesigned user interface similar to that of iOS 7, intended to feature a more minimal, text-based 'flat' design, with use of translucency effects and intensely saturated colors.[204] Apple's showcase new feature in Yosemite is Handoff, which enables users with iPhones running iOS 8.1 or later to answer phone calls, receive and send SMS messages, and complete unfinished iPhone emails on their Mac. As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaced iPhoto and Aperture.[205]\\r\\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015. Similar to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Apple described this release as containing \\"refinements to the Mac experience\\" and \\"improvements to system performance\\" rather than new features. Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, adopting San Francisco as the system font for clearer legibility, and the introduction of System Integrity Protection. The Metal API, first introduced in iOS 8, was also included in this operating system for \\"all Macs since 2012\\".[206]\\r\\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra was released to the public on September 20, 2016. New features include the addition of Siri, Optimized Storage, and updates to Photos, Messages, and iTunes.[207][208]\\r\\nmacOS 10.13 High Sierra was announced on June 5, 2017, to be due for full release in the Fall. High Sierra uses the new Apple File System, and includes enhancements to Safari, Photos, and Mail, among other changes.\\r\\nAs of July 2016, macOS is the second-most-active general-purpose desktop client operating system in use on the World Wide Web following Microsoft Windows, with a 4.90% usage share according to statistics compiled by the Wikimedia Foundation. It is the most successful Unix-like desktop operating system on the web, estimated at approximately 5 times the usage of Linux (which has 1.01%). Usage share generally continues to shift away from the desktop and toward mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android.[209]\\r\\nIn its earlier years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that have affected Microsoft Windows users.[210][211][212] macOS has a smaller usage share compared to Windows,[213] but it also has traditionally more secure Unix roots. Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to malware.[214] Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks.[215] In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks,[216] and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard were seen as an increasing problem for Mac users. At first, the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions were able to install without user input.[217] Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued. Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem. An estimated 100,000 users were affected.[218][219] Apple releases security updates for macOS regularly.[220]\\r\\nAs a devices company, most large-scale Apple promotion for macOS has been part of the sale of Macs, with promotion of macOS updates generally focused on existing users, promotion at Apple Store and other retail partners, or through events for developers. In larger scale advertising campaigns, Apple specifically promoted macOS as better for handling media and other home-user applications, and comparing Mac OS X (especially versions Tiger and Leopard) with the heavy criticism Microsoft received for the long-awaited Windows Vista operating system.[221][222]","input":"What is the current version of mac ios?"},{"output":"Plymouth Colony","context":"","input":"Which group of english immigrants first settled in plymouth in 1620?"},{"output":"meteor","context":"Shooting star is a common name for the visible path of a meteoroid as it enters the atmosphere, becoming a meteor.\\r\\nShooting star may also refer to:","input":"What is a shooting star also known as?"},{"output":"Great Britain","context":"","input":"Where did western europe's industrial revolution begin?"},{"output":"Oberlin Collegiate Institute in Oberlin, Ohio","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nMixed-sex education, also known as mixed-gender education, co-education or coeducation (abbreviated to co-ed or coed), is a system of education where males and females are educated together. Whereas single-sex education was more common up to the 19th century, mixed-sex education has since become standard in many cultures, particularly in Western countries. Single-sex education, however, remains prevalent in many Muslim countries. The relative merits of both systems have been the subject of debate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's oldest co-educational day and boarding school is Dollar Academy, a junior and senior school for males and females from ages 5 to 18 in Scotland, United Kingdom. From its opening in 1818 the school admitted both boys and girls of the parish of Dollar and the surrounding area. The school continues in existence to the present day with around 1,250 pupils.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first co-educational college to be founded was Oberlin Collegiate Institute in Oberlin, Ohio. It opened on December 3, 1833, with 44 students, including 29 men and 15 women. Fully equal status for women did not arrive until 1837, and the first three women to graduate with bachelor's degrees did so in 1840.[2]  By the late 20th century, many institutions of higher learning that had been exclusively for people of one sex had become coeducational.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early civilizations, people were educated informally: primarily within the household. As time progressed, education became more structured and formal. Women often had very few rights when education started to become a more important aspect of civilization. Efforts of the ancient Greek and Chinese societies focused primarily on the education of males. In ancient Rome, the availability of education was gradually extended to women, but they were taught separately from men. The early Christians and medieval Europeans continued this trend, and single-sex schools for the privileged classes prevailed through the Reformation period.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 16th century, at the Council of Trent, the Roman Catholic church reinforced the establishment of free elementary schools for children of all classes. The concept of universal elementary education, regardless of sex, had been created.[3] After the Reformation, coeducation was introduced in western Europe, when certain Protestant groups urged that boys and girls should be taught to read the Bible. The practice became very popular in northern England, Scotland, and colonial New England, where young children, both male and female, attended dame schools. In the late 18th century, girls gradually were admitted to town schools. The Society of Friends in England, as well as in the United States, pioneered coeducation as they did universal education, and in Quaker settlements in the British colonies, boys and girls commonly attended school together. The new free public elementary, or common schools, which after the American Revolution supplanted church institutions, were almost always coeducational, and by 1900 most public high schools were coeducational as well.[4] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coeducation grew much more widely accepted. In Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union, the education of girls and boys in the same classes became an approved practice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia there is a trend towards increased coeducational schooling with new coeducational schools opening, few new single sex schools opening and existing single sex schools combining or opening their doors to the opposite gender.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first mixed-sex institution of higher learning in China was the Nanjing Higher Normal Institute, which was renamed National Central University and Nanjing University. For millennia in China, public schools, especially public higher learning schools, were for men. Generally only schools established by zongzu (ڕA, gens) were for both male and female students. Some schools such as Li Zhi's school in Ming Dynasty and Yuan Mei's school in Qing Dynasty enrolled both male and female students. In the 1910s women's universities were established such as Ginling Women's University and Peking Girls' Higher Normal School, but there were no coeducation in higher learning schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nTao Xingzhi, the Chinese advocator of mixed-sex education, proposed The Audit Law for Women Students (?Wba?ż) at the meeting of Nanjing Higher Normal School held on December seventh, 1919. He also proposed that the university recruit female students. The idea was supported by the president Guo Bingwen, academic director Liu Boming, and such famous professors as Lu Zhiwei and Yang Xingfo, but opposed by many famous men of the time. The meeting passed the law and decided to recruit women students next year. Nanjing Higher Normal School enrolled eight Chinese female students in 1920. In the same year Peking University also began to allow women students to audit classes. One of the most notable female students of that time was Jianxiong Wu.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949, the People's Republic of China was founded. The Chinese government has provided more equal opportunities for education since then,[citation needed] and all schools and universities have become mixed-sex. In recent years, however, many female and/or single-sex schools have again emerged for special vocational training needs but equal rights for education still apply to all citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn China Muslim Hui and Muslim Salars are against coeducation, due to Islam,[clarification needed] Uyghurs are the only Muslims in China that do not mind coeducation and practice it.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmission to the Sorbonne was opened to girls in 1860.[7] The baccalaureat became gender-blind in 1924, giving equal chances to all girls in applying to any universities. Mixed-sex education became mandatory for primary schools in 1957 and for all universities in 1975.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Paul's Co-educational College was the first mixed-sex secondary school in Hong Kong. It was founded in 1915 as St. Paul's Girls' College. At the end of World War II it was temporarily merged with St. Paul's College, which is a boys' school. When classes at the campus of St. Paul's College were resumed, it continued to be mixed, and changed to its present name. Some others renowned mixed-sex secondary schools in town include Hong Kong Pui Ching Middle School, Queen Elizabeth School and Tsuen Wan Government Secondary School. Most of the Hong Kong primary and secondary schools are mixed-sex educations, include government public schools, charter schools and private schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nPakistan is one of the many Muslim countries where most schools, colleges and universities are single gender although some universities, colleges and schools are coeducational. In schools that offer O levels and A levels, co-education is quite prevalent. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, most universities were coeducational by name but the proportion of women was less than 5%. After the Islamization policies in early 1980s the government established Women's colleges and Women's universities to promote education among women who were hesitant of studying in mixed-sex environment. Today, however, most universities and a large number of schools in urban areas are co-educational.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom the official term is mixed,[9] and today most schools are mixed.\\r\\nA number of Quaker co-educational boarding schools were established before the 19th century.\\r\\nThe Scottish Dollar Academy was the first mixed-sex day and boarding school in the UK. Founded in 1818, it is the oldest mixed-sex educational institution in the world still in existence. In England the first non-Quaker mixed-sex public boarding school was Bedales School, founded in 1893 by John Haden Badley and becoming mixed in 1898.  Many previously single-sex schools have begun to accept both sexes in the past few decades: for example, Clifton College began to accept girls in 1987.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first higher-education institution in the United Kingdom to allow women and men to enter on equal terms, and hence be admitted to academic degrees, was the University of Bristol (then established as University College, Bristol) in 1876.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven their dual role as both boarding house and educational establishment, individual colleges at Oxford and Cambridge remained segregated for much longer. The first Oxford college to house both men and women was the graduate-only Nuffield College in 1937; the first five undergraduate colleges (Brasenose, Hertford, Jesus, St Catherine's and Wadham) became mixed in 1974. The first mixed Cambridge college was the graduate-only Darwin from its foundation in 1964. Churchill, Clare and King's Colleges were the first previously all-male colleges of the University of Cambridge to admit female undergraduates in 1972. Magdalene was the last all-male college to become mixed in 1988.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last single-sex (all-women's) college in Oxford, St Hilda's, became mixed as of Michaelmas term 2008; however some Permanent Private Halls still exist which are open only to men. Three colleges remain single-sex (women-only) at Cambridge: Murray Edwards (New Hall), Newnham and Lucy Cavendish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest extant mixed-sex institute of higher education in the United States is Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, which was established in 1833.  Mixed-sex classes were admitted to the preparatory department at Oberlin in 1833 and the college department in 1837.[13][14]  The first four women to receive bachelor's degrees in the United States earned them at Oberlin in 1841.  Later, in 1862, the first black woman to receive a bachelor's degree (Mary Jane Patterson) also earned it from Oberlin College.  Beginning in 1844, Hillsdale College became the next college to admit mixed-sex classes to four-year degree programs.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of Iowa became the first coeducational public or state university in the United States in 1855,[16] and for much of the next century, public universities, and land grant universities in particular, would lead the way in mixed-sex higher education.  There were also many private coeducational universities founded in the 19th century, especially west of the Mississippi River.  East of the Mississippi, Wheaton College (Illinois) graduated its first female student in 1862,[17] while Cornell University[18] and the University of Michigan[19] each admitted their first female students in 1870.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the same time, single-sex women's colleges were also appearing.  According to Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra: \\"women's colleges were founded during the mid- and late-19th century in response to a need for advanced education for women at a time when they were not admitted to most institutions of higher education.\\"[20]  Notable examples include the Seven Sisters colleges, of which Vassar College is now coeducational and Radcliffe College has merged with Harvard University.  Other notable women's colleges that have become coeducational include Wheaton College in Massachusetts, Ohio Wesleyan Female College in Ohio, Skidmore College, Wells College, and Sarah Lawrence College in New York state, Pitzer College in California, Goucher College in Maryland and Connecticut College.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1900 the Briton Frederic Harrison said after visiting the United States that \\"The whole educational machinery of America ... open to women must be at least twentyfold greater than with us, and it is rapidly advancing to meet that of men both in numbers and quality\\".[21] Where most of the history of coeducation in this period is a list of those moving toward the accommodation of both men and women at one campus, the state of Florida was an exception. In 1905, the Buckman Act was one of consolidation in governance and funding but separation in race and gender, with the campus that became what is now Florida State University designated to serve white females during this era, the campus that became what is now the University of Florida serving white males, and coeducation stipulated only for the campus serving black students at the site of what is now Florida A & M. Florida did not return to coeducation at UF and FSU until after World War II, prompted by the drastically increased demands placed on the higher education system by veterans studying via GI Bill programs following World War II. The Buckman arrangements officially ended with new legislation guidelines passed in 1947.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral early primary and secondary schools in the United States were single-sex.  Examples include Collegiate School, a boys' school operating in New York by 1638 (which remains a single-sex institution); and Boston Latin School, founded in 1635 (which didn't became coeducational until 1972).\\r\\n\\r\\nNonetheless, mixed-sex education existed at the lower levels in the U.S. long before it extended to colleges.  For example, in 1787, the predecessor to Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, opened as a mixed-sex secondary school.[22][23]  Its first enrollment class consisted of 78 male and 36 female students.  Among the latter was Rebecca Gratz, the first Jewish female college student in the United States.[citation needed]  However, the school soon began having financial problems and it reopened as an all-male institution.  Westford Academy in Westford, Massachusetts has operated as mixed-sex secondary school since its founding in 1792, making it the oldest continuously operating coed school in America.[24] The oldest continuously operating coed boarding school in the United States is Cushing Academy, founded in 1865.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nA minister and a missionary founded Oberlin in 1833. Reverent.  John Shipherd (minister) and Philo P. Stewart (missionary), became  friends while spending the summer of 1832 together in nearby Elyria. They  discovered a mutual disenchantment with what they saw as the lack of strong  Christian principles among the settlers of the American West. They decided to  establish a college and a colony based on their religious beliefs, \\"where they would train teachers and other Christian leaders for the  boundless most desolate fields in the West\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe college and community succeeded on progressive causes and social justice. Oberlin's earliest graduates were women and African Americans. While Oberlin was co-educational from its founding in 1833, the college regularly admitted African American students beginning in 1835, after trustee and abolitionist, Reverent. Shipherd, cast the deciding vote to allow them entry. Women were not admitted to the baccalaureate program, which granted bachelor's degrees, until 1837. Prior to that, they received diplomas from what was called the Ladies Course. The college admitted its first group of women in 1837: Caroline Mary Rudd, Elizabeth Prall, Mary Hosford, and Mary Fletcher Kellogg.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early success and achievement of women at Oberlin College persuaded many early women's rights leaders that coeducation would soon be accepted throughout the country. However, for quite a while, women sometimes suffered uncivil behavior from their male classmates. The prejudice of some male professors proved more unsettling. Many professors had disapproved of the admission of women into their classes, citing studies that stated that women were physically incapable of higher education, and some professors found it difficult to acknowledge women's presence once they were admitted.[27] Even today, some books, studies, and other arguments claim that women and men learn very differently from each other because of their brain differences. One of these books is Boys and Girls Learn Differently! by Michael Gurian.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the 19th century, 70% of American colleges were coeducational, although the state of Florida was a notable exception, moving toward greater separation of education at state schools as mandated by the Buckman Act in 1905 and only returning fully to coeducation in the system redesign prompted by the end of World War II.[citation needed] In the late 20th century, many institutions of higher learning that had been exclusively for people of one sex became coeducational.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of Greek-letter student societies have either been established (locally or nationally) or expanded as co-ed fraternities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn American colloquial language, \\"coed\\" or \\"co-ed\\" is used to refer to a mixed school.\\r\\nThe word is also often used to describe a situation in which both sexes are integrated in any form (e.g., \\"The team is coed\\"). As a noun, the word \\"coed\\" is used to refer to a female student in a mixed gender school.[29]  The noun use is considered sexist and unprofessional by those who argue that it implies that including women somehow transforms what is \\"normal\\" (male-only \\"education\\") into something different (\\"coeducation\\"):[30][31] technically both male and female students at a coeducational institution should be considered \\"coeds\\".[32] Numerous professional organizations require that the gender-neutral term \\"student\\" be used instead of \\"coed\\" or, when gender is relevant to the context, that the term \\"female student\\" be substituted.[33][34][35][36] Usage guides make no exception for any use of the noun to distinguish a female student at a coeducational institution from a student at a women-only institution: they do not even mention such use, possibly because such uses are comparatively rare and because the term cannot be distanced from its unacceptable uses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the sexes were educated together, we should have the healthy, moral and intellectual stimulus of sex ever quickening and refining all the faculties, without the undue excitement of senses that results from novelty in the present system of isolation.\\r\\nFor years, a question many educators, parents, and researchers have been asking is whether or not it is academically beneficial to teach boys and girls together or separately at school.[37] Some argue that coeducation has primarily social benefits, allowing males and females of all ages to become more prepared for real-world situations, whereas a student that is only familiar with a single-sex setting could be less prepared, nervous, or uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, certain authors argue that at certain ages, students may be more distracted by the opposite sex in a coeducational setting.[citation needed] This distraction may affect how often a student is willing to raise his or her hand in class and urge students to be less focused on the lesson. Girls may have lower, more traditional aspirations and may choose occupations that tend to be more traditional in nature as opposed to science-related occupations.[38] According to advocates of coeducation, without classmates of the opposite sex, students have social issues that may impact adolescent development. They argue that the absence of the opposite sex creates an unrealistic environment not duplicated in the real world.[39] Some studies show that in classes that are separated by gender, male and female students work and learn on the same level as their peers, the stereotypical mentality of the teacher is removed, and girls are likely to have more confidence in the classroom than they would in a coeducational class.[40]","input":"What was the first american college to become co-educational?"},{"output":"in 1998","context":"The Google company was launched in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to market Google Search, which has become the most widely used web-based search engine.

The SDLP's goal was to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library\\" and it was funded through the National Science Foundation, among other federal agencies.[5][6][7][8]\\r\\nPage's web crawler began exploring the web in March 1996, with Page's own Stanford home page serving as the only starting point.[3] To convert the backlink data that it gathered for a given web page into a measure of importance, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm.[3] While analyzing BackRub's outputwhich, for a given URL, consisted of a list of backlinks ranked by importancethe pair realized that a search engine based on PageRank would produce better results than existing techniques (existing search engines at the time essentially ranked results according to how many times the search term appeared on a page).[3][9]\\r\\nConvinced that the pages with the most links to them from other highly relevant Web pages must be the most relevant pages associated with the search, Page and Brin tested their thesis as part of their studies, and laid the foundation for their search engine.[10]\\r\\nSome Rough Statistics (from August 29th, 1996)\\r\\nTotal indexable HTML urls: 75.2306?Million\\r\\nTotal content downloaded: 207.022?gigabytes\\r\\n...\\r\\nBackRub is written in Java and Python and runs on several Sun Ultras and Intel Pentiums running Linux.

The domain google.com was registered on September 15, 1997. They formally incorporated their company, Google, on September 4, 1998 in their friend Susan Wojcicki's garage in Menlo Park, California.\\r\\nBoth Brin and Page had been against using advertising pop-ups in a search engine, or an \\"advertising funded search engines\\" model, and they wrote a research paper in 1998 on the topic while still students. They changed their minds early on and allowed simple text ads.[12]\\r\\nBy the end of 1998, Google had an index of about 60?million pages.[13] The home page was still marked \\"BETA\\", but an article in Salon.com already argued that Google's search results were better than those of competitors like Hotbot or Excite.com, and praised it for being more technologically innovative than the overloaded portal sites (like Yahoo!, Excite.com, Lycos, Netscape's Netcenter, AOL.com, Go.com and MSN.com) which at that time, during the growing dot-com bubble, were seen as \\"the future of the Web\\", especially by stock market investors.[13]\\r\\nIn March 1999, the company moved into offices at 165 University Avenue in Palo Alto, home to several other noted Silicon Valley technology startups.[14] After quickly outgrowing two other sites, the company leased a complex of buildings in Mountain View at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway from Silicon Graphics (SGI) in 2003.[15] The company has remained at this location ever since, and the complex has since become known as the Googleplex (a play on the word googolplex, a number that is equal to 1 followed by a googol of zeros). In 2006, Google bought the property from SGI for US$319?million.[16]\\r\\nThe Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the growing number of Internet users, who liked its simple design.[17] In 2000, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords.[2] The ads were text-based to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed.[2] Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bid and click-throughs, with bidding starting at $.05 per click.[2] This model of selling keyword advertising was pioneered by Goto.com (later renamed Overture Services, before being acquired by Yahoo! and rebranded as Yahoo! Search Marketing).[18][19][20] While many of its dot-com rivals failed in the new Internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.[2]\\r\\nGoogle's declared code of conduct is \\"Don't be evil\\", a phrase which they went so far as to include in their prospectus (aka \\"S-1\\") for their 2004 IPO, noting that \\"We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better servedas shareholders and in all other waysby a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains.\\"[21] In 2008, Google launched Knol, their own equivalent of Wikipedia,[22] which failed four years later.[23]\\r\\nIn 2011, the company launched Google+, its fourth foray into social networking, following Google Buzz (launched 2010, retired in 2011), Google Friend Connect (launched 2008, retired by March 1, 2012), and Orkut (launched in 2004, retired in September 2014[24])\\r\\nAs of November 2014, Google operated over 70 offices in more than 41 countries.[25]\\r\\nIn 2015, Google reorganized its interests as a holding company, Alphabet Inc., with Google as its leading subsidiary. Google continued to serve as the umbrella for Alphabet's Internet interests.[26][27][28]\\r\\nThe first funding for Google as a company was secured in August 1998 in the form of a US$100,000 contribution from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, given to a corporation which did not yet exist.[29]\\r\\nOn June 7, 1999, a round of equity funding totalling $25?million was announced;[30] the major investors being rival venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital.[29] While Google still needed more funding for their further expansion, Brin and Page were hesitant to take the company public, despite their financial issues. They were not ready to give up control over Google.\\r\\nFollowing the closing of the $25?million financing round, Sequoia encouraged Brin and Page to hire a CEO. Brin and Page ultimately acquiesced and hired Eric Schmidt as Googles first CEO in March 2001.[31]\\r\\nIn October 2003, while discussing a possible initial public offering of shares (IPO), Microsoft approached the company about a possible partnership or merger.[32] The deal never materialized. In January 2004, Google announced the hiring of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group to arrange an IPO. The IPO was projected to raise as much as $4?billion.\\r\\nGoogle's initial public offering took place on August 19, 2004.[33] A total of 19,605,052 shares were offered at a price of $85 per share.[34] Of that, 14,142,135 (another mathematical reference as |2  1.4142135) were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders. The sale raised US$1.67?billion, and gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23?billion.[35] Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. Yahoo!, a competitor of Google, also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7?million shares of Google.[36]\\r\\nThe company was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol GOOG. When Alphabet was created as Google's parent company, it retained Google's stock price history and ticker symbol.\\r\\nIn February 2003, Google acquired Pyra Labs, owner of Blogger, a web log hosting website. The acquisition secured the company's competitive ability to use information gleaned from blog postings to improve the speed and relevance of articles contained in a companion product to the search engine Google News.\\r\\nIn February 2004, Yahoo! dropped its partnership with Google, providing an independent search engine of its own. This cost Google some market share, yet Yahoo!'s move highlighted Google's own distinctiveness,[citation needed] and today[when?] the verb \\"to google\\" has entered a number of languages (first as a slang verb and now as a standard word), meaning \\"to perform a web search\\" (a possible indication of \\"Google\\" becoming a genericized trademark).[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the IPO, Google's stock market capitalization rose greatly and the stock price more than quadrupled. On August 19, 2004 the number of shares outstanding was 172.85?million while the \\"free float\\" was 19.60?million (which makes 89% held by insiders). Google has a dual class stock structure in which each Class B share gets ten votes compared to each Class A share getting one. Page said in the prospectus that Google has \\"a dual class structure that is biased toward stability and independence and that requires investors to bet on the team, especially Sergey and me.\\"\\r\\nIn June, 2005, Google was valued at nearly $52?billion, making it one of the world's biggest media companies by stock market value.[37]\\r\\nOn August 18, 2005 (one year after the initial IPO), Google announced that it would sell 14,159,265 (another mathematical reference as   3.14159265) more shares of its stock to raise money. The move would double Google's cash stockpile to $7?billion. Google said it would use the money for \\"acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets\\".[38]\\r\\nOn September 28, 2005, Google announced a long-term research partnership with NASA which would involve Google building a 1,000,000-square-foot (93,000?m2) R&D center at NASA's Ames Research Center, and on December 31, 2005 Time Warner's AOL unit and Google unveiled an expanded partnershipsee Partnerships below.\\r\\nAdditionally in 2005, Google formed a partnership with Sun Microsystems to help share and distribute each other's technologies. As part of the partnership Google will hire employees to help in the open source office program OpenOffice.org.[39]\\r\\nWith Google's increased size came more competition from large mainstream technology companies. One such example is the rivalry between Microsoft and Google.[40] Microsoft had been touting its Bing search engine to counter Google's competitive position. Furthermore, the two companies are increasingly offering overlapping services, such as webmail (Gmail vs. Hotmail), search (both online and local desktop searching), and other applications (for example, Microsoft's Windows Live Local competes with Google Earth). In addition to an Internet Explorer replacement Google designed its own Linux-based operating system called Chrome OS to directly compete with Microsoft Windows. There were also rumors of a Google web browser, fueled much by the fact that Google was the owner of the domain name \\"gbrowser.com\\".[citation needed] These were later proven when Google released Google Chrome. This corporate feud boiled over into the courts when Kai-Fu Lee, a former vice-president of Microsoft, quit Microsoft to work for Google. Microsoft sued to stop his move by citing Lee's non-compete contract (he had access to much sensitive information regarding Microsoft's plans in China). Google and Microsoft reached a settlement out of court on December 22, 2005, the terms of which are confidential.[41]\\r\\nClick fraud also became a growing problem for Google's business strategy. Google's CFO George Reyes said in a December 2004 investor conference that \\"something has to be done about this really, really quickly, because I think, potentially, it threatens our business model.\\"[42]\\r\\nWhile the company's primary market is in the web content arena, Google has experimented with other markets, such as radio and print publications. On January 17, 2006, Google announced that it had purchased the radio advertising company dMarc, which provides an automated system that allows companies to advertise on the radio.[43] Google also began an experiment in selling advertisements from its advertisers in offline newspapers and magazines, with select advertisements in the Chicago Sun-Times.[44]\\r\\nDuring the third quarter 2005 Google Conference Call, Eric Schmidt said, \\"We don't do the same thing as everyone else does. And so if you try to predict our product strategy by simply saying well so and so has this and Google will do the same thing, it's almost always the wrong answer. We look at markets as they exist and we assume they are pretty well served by their existing players. We try to see new problems and new markets using the technology that others use and we build.\\"\\r\\nAfter months of speculation, Google was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 index (S&P 500) on March 31, 2006.[45] Google replaced Burlington Resources, a major oil producer based in Houston that had been acquired by ConocoPhillips.[46] The day after the announcement Google's share price rose by 7%.[47]\\r\\nIn its infancy, very little was needed to fully optimize on page content in the eyes of Google.[48] With an inverse relationship between query position (in the HTML tag hierarchy) and weight, it simply boiled down to putting ones important keywords higher on the HTML tag hierarchy.[49] With this relatively simple algorithm in place, webmasters quickly discovered tricks to vastly boost their SERP (Search Engine Ranking Position). One of the first instances of deceitful SEO came in the form of link keyword stuffing under on page content. As a response, Google removed these sites from its index, a practice it occasionally reverts to as a way of punishing disingenuous webmasters looking to cheat the system. The seemingly arbitrary changes to Googles PageRank algorithm however, led to both community outrage (many declaring the death of PageRank) and a noticeable decline in precision of search results.[50] Google was also constructing its index via a large monthly crawl. Not only did this lock search results to this one month window, it also meant that results would show stale content. An update dubbed Everflux introduced fresh crawling (daily crawls) to supplement the larger, primary crawl.[51] Daily crawling added another layer of relevancy (based upon date and time), to content ranking.[51] The inconsistencies of index versions across data centers during the early implementation of Everflux panicked webmasters, who saw their SERPs fluctuate wildly from day to day.\\r\\nGoogle's Boston update in February 2003 saw major algorithmic changes and the promise of frequent index updates.[52] Cassandra marked a much more aggressive attack on shady SEO techniques like hidden and disguised keyword links, by emphasizing link quality[52] This was taken a step further in Dominic, which sought to analyze the quality of all backlinks to prevent the then emerging practice of splogging (the practice of creating nonsensical offsite content to boost SERP of another site).[53] To combat practices like Googlebombing (putting irrelevant, often negative anchor text linking to popular websites) Dominic tinkered with the weighting of anchor text while stringently scrutinizing back links and internal linking.[54] An exploit where webmasters would link to the same site using different anchor text (thereby allowing both links to unfairly contribute to sites PageRank) was addressed by allowing only one site (given duplicate site links with differing anchor text) link to flow to PageRank.[55]\\r\\nFritz finalized the Everflux implementation, meaning Google's index would receive some degree of updating every day.[52] Daily crawling added another layer of relevancy, (based upon date and time), to content ranking.[51] The creation of a supplemental index was designed to house content Google felt didnt quite fit in its main index (due either to a low PageRank or shady linking practices).[56] Storing some sites in a separate index that was to be searched only when no good match was found in the primary index, Google hoped, would seamlessly filter out duplicate and untrustworthy content.[57] Questions about the efficacy of a multi-index system (particularly on improving recall) arose, and it remains unclear as to whether Google has retained this system.\\r\\nGoogle's Florida update looked to be the proverbial nail in the coffin for SEO abusers. With Florida, context and relevancy were determined not just by the appearance of keywords, but of synonyms and supporting vocabulary throughout the page.[58] This sought to eliminate keyword and inbound anchor text dumping.[59] Features that had long been experimented on, like phrase proximity and keyword stemming, became official and users were now being penalized for overly using commercial/popular keywords.[58] With Florida coming down hard on SEO, many webmasters with commercial presences on the web took a drastic hit. The real estate community in particular, was hit hard by Floridas changes to Google rankings. In its attempt at wide spread reform, the quality of results took a hit and many site owners felt they took undeserved drops.\\r\\nTo create seamless personalization of search (beyond manual filtering) Google began tapping into users browsing histories to deliver more relevant, personal results.[60] Promising to grow with the users browsing history, Personalized Search added a new dimension to search by incorporating past user behavior.[60] The implementation of personalized search was a blow to those relying on SEO techniques, as user browsing history was an element outside of their control.\\r\\nBy allowing webmasters to create and submit XML files dictating URLs to be crawled as well as procedural information regarding how the page should be crawled, Google expanded the scope of its index.[61] Providing an additional method of organically increasing site exposure, Google hoped, would decrease the need for shady SEO practices.\\r\\nBig Daddy was less an algorithmic change as it was a change of Google's crawling and indexing infrastructure.[62] Pages with superfluous, reciprocal linking schemes and irrelevant outbound and inbound links would be demoted in the new crawler.[62] Whereas previous updates handled the issue of link reliability through algorithmic changes, the Big Daddy modified how many pages a site would have crawled, and subsequently added to the index. The number of pages crawled on a site was again dependent on the relevance and quality of its links.[62]\\r\\nIn May 2007 Google implemented Universal search to its standard web results page.[63] Search results were now a compilation of all relevant results across all of Googles vertical search engines, (Google Images, Google Video etc.).[64] With the implementation of Universal Search, coverage of all types of content (not simply text) rose significantly. It now became important to optimize all forms of on-site content, not just on-site text content, increasing the complexity and breadth of SEO.\\r\\nGoogle Suggest marked the addition of real-time query suggestion. As users began to enter a query, a list of possible query matches would dynamically appear beneath the search bar, allowing for quicker and more accurate searches.[65] According to Google, only about 2% of all user queries were tracked and monitored, in an effort to better improve the service, quelling concerns over privacy.[65] The addition of instant suggestions added yet another dynamic to SEO, as webmasters now vied to associate their site with high ranking instant suggestion queries.[66]\\r\\nIn December 2009, Google integrated real time search results to its main SERP. Newly indexed, relevant content from social media and news sources would be dynamically inserted into a users SERP, thus providing real time content.[67] Google also announced its desire to prioritize original, user driven social media over authoritative, corporate social media.[68] Additionally, a separate updates filter was added, allowing the user to receive all incoming content from social media, sports, and news sources.[67]\\r\\nGoogles Caffeine was the result of a complete overhaul of Googles indexing structure.[69] To accommodate for the explosion of new forms of content (video, real-time content, images) and growing user expectations, Google ditched its old linear system of indexing in favor of the more flexible Caffeine, capable of indexing thousands of pages in parallel.[69] Google would no longer execute lengthy crawls supplemented by smaller daily crawls, but instead dynamically add to its index whenever new information appeared.[69] Caffeine was reported to offer 50% fresher content than Googles previous index, and required around 100 million gigabytes of storage.[69]\\r\\nIn February 2011, the New York Times published an article titled The Dirty Little Secrets of Search detailing back link purchasing by the clothing retailer JCPenney.[70] By purchasing thousands of backlinks (often on unrelated sites), JCPenney dominated Googles SERP across many clothing related queries, and even queries specifying a brand (JCPenney topped Samsonite for the query Samsonite carryon luggage).[70] Given Googles previous updates and their emphasis on backlink analysis, the JCPenney incident revealed that flaws still existed within the Google ranking algorithm. Google quickly demoted JCPenneys search position, crippling online sales.[70] Google has since lifted the demotion.\\r\\nThe name \\"Google\\" originated from a misspelling of \\"googol\\",[71][72] which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank:[73] \\"We chose our systems name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.\\"\\r\\nThere are uses of the name going back at least as far as the creation of the comic strip character Barney Google in 1919. British children's author Enid Blyton used the phrase \\"Google Bun\\" in The Magic Faraway Tree (published 1941) and The Folk of the Faraway Tree (published 1946),[74] and called a clown character \\"Google\\" in Circus Days Again (published 1942).[75] There is also the Googleplex Star Thinker from Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In March 1996 a business called Groove Track Productions applied for a United States trademark for \\"Google\\" for various products including several categories of clothing, stuffed toys, board games, and candy. The firm abandoned its application in July 1997.[76]\\r\\nHaving found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb \\"google\\" was added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006, meaning \\"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\\"[77][78] The use of the term itself reflects their mission to organize a seemingly infinite amount of information on the web.[72] In November 2009, the Global Language Monitor named \\"Google\\" No. 7 on its Top Words of the Decade list.[79] In December 2009 the BBC highlighted Google in their \\"Portrait of the Decade (Words)\\" series.[80] In May 2012, David Elliott filed a complaint against Google, Inc. claiming that Googles once distinctive mark GOOGLE? has become generic and lacks trademark significance due to its common use as a transitive verb. After losing to Google in UDRP proceedings involving many Google-related domain name registrations that he owns, Elliott later sought a declaratory judgment that his domain names are rightfully his, that they do not infringe any trademark rights Google may own, and that all Googles registered GOOGLE? marks should be cancelled since Google is now a common generic word worldwide that means to search the Internet.[81]\\r\\nIn 2004, Google formed a non-profit philanthropic wing that gave all the details to the user with a non profit aim and determination unlike, Google.org, giving it a starting fund of $1?billion.[82] The express mission of the organization is to help with the issues of climate change (see also global warming), global public health, and global poverty. Among its first projects is to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can attain 0.24 litre/10?km.[83]\\r\\nGoogle has worked with several corporations, in order to improve production and services. On September 28, 2005, Google announced a long-term research partnership with NASA which would involve Google building a 1,000,000-square-foot (93,000?m2) R&D center at NASA's Ames Research Center. NASA and Google are planning to work together on a variety of areas, including large-scale data management, massively distributed computing, bio-info-nano convergence, and encouragement of the entrepreneurial space industry. The new building would also include labs, offices, and housing for Google engineers.[84] In October 2006, Google formed a partnership with Sun Microsystems to help share and distribute each other's technologies. As part of the partnership Google will hire employees to help the open source office program OpenOffice.org.[39]\\r\\nTime Warner's AOL unit and Google unveiled an expanded partnership on December 21, 2005, including an enhanced global advertising partnership and a US$1?billion investment by Google for a 5% stake in AOL.[85] As part of the collaboration, Google plans to work with AOL on video search and offer AOL's premium-video service within Google Video. This did not allow users of Google Video to search for AOL's premium-video services. Display advertising throughout the Google network will also increase.\\r\\nIn August 2006, Google signed a $900?million offer with News Corp.'s Fox Interactive Media unit to provide search and advertising on MySpace and other News Corp. websites including IGN, AmericanIdol.com, Fox.com, and Rotten Tomatoes, although Fox Sports is not included as a deal already exists between News Corp. and MSN.[86][87]\\r\\nOn December 6, 2006, British Sky Broadcasting released details of a Sky and Google alliance.[88] This includes a feature where Gmail will link with Sky and host a mail service for Sky, incorporating the email domain \\"@sky.com\\".\\r\\nIn 2007, Google displaced America Online as a key partner and sponsor of the NORAD Tracks Santa program.[89][90][91] Google Earth was used for the first time to give visitors to the website the impression that they were following Santa Claus' progress in 3-D.[92] The program also made its presence known on YouTube in 2007 as part of its partnership with Google.[93]\\r\\nIn January 2009, Google announced a partnership with the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, allowing the Pope to have his own channel on YouTube.[94]\\r\\nIn January 2013, Google announced a partnership with Kia Motors and Hyundai. The partnership integrates Google Maps and Place into new car models to be released later in 2013.[95]\\r\\nIn coordination with several of the major corporations, including Microsoft, Nokia, LG, Samsung, and Ericsson, Google provided financial support in the launch of the .mobi top level domain created specifically for the mobile internet, stating that it is supporting the new domain extension to help set the standards that will define the future of mobile content and improve the experience of Google users.[96] In early 2006, Google launched Google.mobi, a mobile search portal offering several Google mobile products, including stripped-down versions of its applications and services for mobile users.[97] On September 17, 2007, Google launched \\"Adsense for Mobile\\", a service to its publishing partners providing the ability to monetize their mobile websites through the targeted placement of mobile text ads.[98] Also in September, Google acquired the mobile social networking site, Zingku.mobi to \\"provide people worldwide with direct access to Google applications, and ultimately the information they want and need, right from their mobile devices.\\"[99]\\r\\nOn Wednesday, January 18, 2006, the U.S. Justice Department filed a motion to compel in United States district court in San Jose seeking a court order that would compel search engine company Google Inc. to turn over \\"a multi-stage random sample of one million URLs\\" from Googles database, and a computer file with \\"the text of each search string entered onto Googles search engine over a one-week period (absent any information identifying the person who entered such query).\\"[100] Google maintains that their policy has always been to assure its users' privacy and anonymity, and challenged the subpoena. On March 18, 2006, a federal judge ruled that while Google must surrender 50,000 random URLs, the Department of Justice did not meet the necessary burden to force Google to disclose any search terms entered by its users in Google.\\r\\nA jury in Texas awarded Bedrock Computer Technologies $5?million in a patent lawsuit against Google.[101][102] The patent allegedly covered use of hash tables with garbage collection and separate chaining in the Red Hat Linux kernel. Google and Bedrock later settled the case and the judgment was vacated by the court.[103]\\r\\nIn November 2012, the UK government announced plans to investigate Google, along with Starbucks and Amazon.com, for possible tax avoidance.[104] On 20 January 2016, Google announced that it would pay S130m in back taxes to settle the investigation.[105] However, only 8 days later, it was announced that Google could end up paying more, and UK tax officials were under investigation for what has been termed a \\"sweetheart deal\\" for Google.[106]","input":"When was google made available to the public?"},{"output":"Teriya Magar","context":"The 9th Season of Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa premiered on 30 July 2016 on Colors.[1] The series was hosted by Manish Paul and judged by Jacqueline Fernandez, Karan Johar, Ganesh Hegde and Farah Khan.

It is the sequel to the 2013 video game Tomb Raider, a reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise. It was released for Xbox One and Xbox 360 in November 2015 and for Microsoft Windows in January 2016. A special edition of the game, titled Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration, was released worldwide for PlayStation 4 in October 2016.\\r\\nRise of the Tomb Raider was officially announced in June 2014. The game's storyline follows Lara Croft as she ventures into Siberia in search of the legendary city of Kitezh, whilst battling a paramilitary organization that intends on beating her to the city's promise of immortality. Presented from a third-person perspective, the game primarily focuses on survival and combat, while the player may also explore its landscape and various optional tombs. Camilla Luddington returns to voice and perform her role as Lara.\\r\\nUpon release, Rise of the Tomb Raider was critically acclaimed, with critics praising its graphics, gameplay, and characterization. It was the best-selling Xbox One game during Christmas week, and had sold over one million copies by the end of 2015. Additional content was also released, including a new story campaign, a new gameplay mode, as well as new outfits and weapons for Lara.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRise of the Tomb Raider is a third-person action-adventure game that features similar gameplay found in 2013's Tomb Raider. Players control Lara Croft through various environments, battling enemies, and completing puzzle platforming sections, while using improvised weapons and gadgets in order to progress through the story.\\r\\nThe game features a crafting system, allowing players to create items like different arrow types (poison, climbable, fire, grenade, rope) by scavenging materials from plants and animals in the game's harsh environment.[1]\\r\\nThe in-game environment includes a weather system that both human and animal characters can react to and a day-night cycle. For example, to create a hardier winter coat Lara must hunt a wolf which only comes out during a specific time of day and specific weather condition. Lara can swim which will add to her mobility and combat tactics.[2]\\r\\nCombat has been redesigned with more adequate options for stealth and sneak attacks. Lara can use the environment to her advantage; hiding in bushes or trees, shooting arrows at objects to distract enemies, crafting Molotov cocktails and makeshift grenades, or avoiding combat altogether by climbing trees and traversing rooftops. The bow and arrow return from Tomb Raider. The grappling hook, now known as a wire spool, also returns after being absent from the series since Tomb Raider: Underworld. Different types of bows can be fashioned from specific animals and materials that Lara can hunt and salvage. Lara's pistol, shotgun, assault rifle and climbing axe all return from Tomb Raider, each with their own variants. New items introduced include a hunting knife for melee or sneak attacks, a re-breather for underwater exploration, and a lock pick to open locked crates and doors.[1]\\r\\nPlatforming also makes a return, along with mechanics like jumping forwards against a vertical wall, shimming, jumping from ledge to ledge, as well as swinging on trapeze. Quick time events and dodging also return to avoid deadly traps in the game and perform finishing attacks and counters.\\r\\nOne year after the events of Tomb Raider, young archaeologist Lara Croft is struggling to explain her experience of the supernatural on Yamatai and appears to be suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder due to her having to kill to survive on the island. Looking for answers, she turns to her late father's research into the lost city of Kitezh and the promise of immortality. Her father's partner Ana attempts to warn her off as his obsession with Kitezh drove him to ruin and suicide. Lara ignores her and organises an expedition to Syria, hoping to uncover the tomb of the Prophet of Constantinople, a key figure in the legend of Kitezh. Although successful, the tomb is empty, and Lara is interrupted by Trinityan ancient order of knights that now exists as a paramilitary organization investigating the supernaturaland their leader Konstantin. As she flees, Lara discovers a symbol etched into the tomb that she links to a book on Russian religious history in her father's study. A Trinity assassin steals the book, prompting Lara and her friend Jonah to give chase in Siberia. When the two are separated after an avalanche, Lara is forced to go on alone.\\r\\nLara discovers that Trinity has taken over a Soviet-era mining installation as a base of operations in the search for Kitezh. She is caught attempting to retrieve the book and placed in a prison cell with Ana. Konstantin forces Lara to reveal what she knows by slowly strangling Ana in front of her, but Lara is unable to tell anything of use. Ana then reveals herself to be Konstantin's sister and Trinity's spy who has been manipulating her father. The two interrogate her as to the whereabouts of the \\"Divine Source\\", an artifact believed to grant immortality. Lara escapes, and in the process aids Jacob, a mysterious stranger who leads her through the mines into the valley beyond.\\r\\nJacob is revealed to be the leader of the Remnant, the descendants of the followers of the Prophet of Constantinople. As Lara aids in their resistance against Trinity, she begins to learn more about the deathless Prophet and the lost city of Kitezh. After being branded a heretic and pursued by the Order of Trinity, the Prophet and his followers resettled in Russia, where they built Kitezh. However, spurred on by agents of Trinity, the Mongol Hordes led by Genghis Khan attacked the city, and the Prophet was forced to sacrifice it to protect the Divine Source. The Remnant escaped and settled in the area, vowing to defend the city's secret. Jacob warns her that although the Divine Source exists, it is not what she expects it to be. Konstantin's forces repeatedly attack the Remnant, believing them to be heretics and justifying the slaughter as God's will. However, Lara discovers that Ana is dying and has been manipulating her brother to find the Divine Source and save her.\\r\\nJacob and Lara decide that the only way to protect the Divine Source is to retrieve it before Trinity can. In order to do this, Lara recovers the Atlas, an artifact that serves as a map of Kitezh. She is reunited with Jonah, who has been spying on Trinity forces, and they locate the path into the city. However, Konstantin has been aware of Jonah's presence and let him go free in the hopes that he would lead them to Lara. Trinity then attacks and take Jonah and the Atlas. Lara goes after Trinity and tries to rescue Jonah, but before she can free him, Konstantin stabs him and escapes. Lara takes Jonah to Jacob, who miraculously heals Jonah. Jacob then admits that he is the deathless Prophet himself.\\r\\nWith Trinity advancing on the glacier that rests over Kitezh, Lara is forced to enter the city through the Path of the Deathless where she encounters the Deathless Ones, the immortal guardians of the city. Following the journals of a Trinity agent embedded in the Mongolian forces, Lara realizes the truth of Jacob's warning: the Divine Source grants immortality to the person who beholds it at the cost of their sense of self, and the Deathless Ones are the hollow immortal inhabitants of Kitezh who no longer know anything else but defending the city. As Lara enters Kitezh, the Remnant rally to attack the Deathless Ones, giving her time to reach the heart of the city. She encounters Konstantin blocking the path and mortally wounds him; he dies in disbelief that he was not carrying out God's will, but Ana's. Before his death, he claims that Lara's father did not commit suicide, but was in fact murdered by Trinity. Lara is too late to stop Ana from retrieving the Divine Source, a large glowing crystal, but wrests it from her before Ana can use it. Lara then smashes the Divine Source, killing the Deathless Ones and taking away Jacob's immortality. However, he is happy that his death has finally come and thanks Lara for bringing his end as he peacefully disintegrates.\\r\\nIn the aftermath, Jacob's daughter Sofia takes over the Remnant. Jonah recovers from his wounds and joins Lara in planning their next expedition, with Lara vowing to investigate more of the world's mysteries as well as thwart Trinity's plans.\\r\\nA post-credits scene shows Lara and Ana leaving Russia, two weeks before Lara returned to the manor. Lara confronts Ana about whether Ana killed her father. Ana denies it, despite admitting that Trinity gave her the order. Before she can reveal anything else, a sniper shot hits Ana, killing her instantly. The sniper asks his unseen superior about killing Lara, but is told to stand down for the time being.\\r\\nThe Baba Yaga downloadable content sees Lara investigating a disturbance within the Soviet mining facility. After fighting off a Trinity patrol, she discovers a young girl named Nadia hiding in a sawmill. Nadia confides in Lara, recounting her search for her grandfather, Ivan. Ivan has disappeared while trying to enter the Wicked Vale, a valley rumoured to be haunted by Baba Yaga, a witch from Russian folklore. Ivan blames the witch for the death of his wife and seeks to kill her. Lara is skeptical of Baba Yaga's existence, but as Nadia is injured, she agrees to enter the Wicked Vale and locate Ivan.\\r\\nOnce in the Vale, Lara is exposed to a rare pollen with potent hallucinogenic properties. After stumbling through a forest, tormented by visions of her father's suicide, she encounters Baba Yaga and a pack of demonic wolves. Lara narrowly escapes with her life and finds herself in a small Soviet-era outpost. There she unearths evidence of a secret Soviet biological weapons project that attempted to harness the pollen as a weapon; however, the project came to an abrupt end after the researchersincluding Serafima, a biochemist imprisoned in a nearby gulagsuccumbed to the hallucinations.\\r\\nRealising that Serafima resented her captors, Lara correctly deduces that she had successfully weaponised the pollen and developed an antidote and kept her research secret from the military. With Nadia's help, Lara synthesises a rudimentary antidote from Serafima's recipe and returns to the Wicked Vale. Resisting the effects of the pollen, Lara finds Ivan injured at the entrance to Baba Yaga's lair.\\r\\nUnable to leave the Wicked Vale so long as Baba Yaga continues to control it, Lara ventures on to confront the witch and is forced to battle Baba Yaga under the effects of the pollen. Lara prevails, destroying the source of the weaponised pollen. Baba Yaga is revealed to be Serafima, who was led to believe that her husband, Ivan, along with their daughter was dead, and so used the pollen to become Baba Yaga and torment her captors in revenge. With Ivan, Serafima and Nadia reunited, Lara leaves the Wicked Vale.\\r\\nThe Cold Darkness Awakened content sees Lara enter a decommissioned Soviet weapons bunker that has been breached by a Trinity patrol. Trinity have inadvertently released an unstable pathogen into the air, which causes the people it infects to regress to a zombie-like state. Men are particularly vulnerable as the virus stimulates testosterone and adrenaline production. The pathogen was created by a Soviet researcher with the intention of creating an army of unstoppable super-soldiers, but all of his experiments ended in failure. Following an accident that released the pathogen, he died in the facility, proud that he had at least created a weapon to protect his homeland. With Sofia and Nadia providing support from a helicopter, Lara attempts to find the source of the pathogen before an enormous cloud is released into the atmosphere and contaminates the Remnant valley.\\r\\nThe three women hatch a plan to channel the pathogen from three towers into the central tower, and cause it to explode, which will hopefully burn off the toxin. Lara shuts down each tower while collecting equipment, rescuing female prisoners and eliminating waves of the infected Trinity soldiers, and finally enters the core tower. While fighting off the infected soldiers, she triggers a catastrophic explosion and jumps from the tower to Nadia and Sofia's helicopter. Nadia and Lara watch the explosion as they fly to safety. Although the resulting fire burns the remaining reserves of the pathogen, documents found throughout the facility reveal that the release was no accident; Trinity reactivated the facility to acquire a sample of the pathogen, and an agent of Trinity escaped with it before the bunker was destroyed.\\r\\nBlood Ties begins with Lara reading a note from her uncle, who claims that since her mother went missing, leaving the manor in his care, he is the rightful owner of the Croft Estate. With trees working their way into the side of the manor and the roof caving in, Lara's childhood home is in desperate need of repair. She finds her father's safe and searches the manor for the clues for the safe combination, hoping to find his will proving her ownership inside. She roams around the manor, coming across various artifacts from her past, some of which she has never seen before, and finally figures out the safe combination. However, she finds no proof of her ownership inside the safe. She continues to search through the Manor among the hallways, bedrooms, studies, and the basement, eventually finding her mother's tomb underneath the grand staircase, a proof of her mother's death. With both of Lara's parents proven dead, all her parents' properties are passed on to her by law, successfully proving that Lara is the rightful owner of the Manor.\\r\\nIn Lara's Nightmare the sequence begins similarly to Blood Ties, but instead Lara's uncle is unwilling to give her the Manor. She fights off hordes of zombies and skulls before finding the Master Key. Finally, she kills the large skull in the main hallway, successfully ending her nightmare.\\r\\nOn August 1, 2013, Phil Rogers, Square Enix' Western CEO, confirmed in a blog post on the company's official website that a \\"next-generation Tomb Raider sequel\\" is \\"well into development\\".[3] On June 9, 2014, Rise of the Tomb Raider was formally announced with a press release, after a first trailer premiered on Microsoft's E3 press conference earlier the same day. That same trailer was later televised during Xbox Live's broadcast of the Miss Teen USA 2014 beauty pageant.\\r\\nAt Microsoft's Gamescom 2014 briefing, it was announced that the game will be released in late 2015 as a timed exclusive for Xbox platforms.[4][5] Speaking on the exclusivity, Phil Spencer said \\"...I'm a big fan of Uncharted and I wish we had an action adventure game of that ilk. We've started some, and we've looked at them. But we don't have one today of that quality. This is an opportunity.\\"[6] The exclusivity news was met with widespread negative criticism from consumers and journalists alike.[7] In February 2015, Crystal Dynamics announced that the Xbox 360 version is being developed by Nixxes Software.[8]\\r\\nOn June 15, 2015, at Microsoft E3 2015's press conference, Rise of the Tomb Raider was confirmed to be released in North America on November 10, 2015 on the Xbox One and Xbox 360.[9] A behind the scene trailer was released during Square Enix's press conference on June 16, 2015.[10] On July 23, 2015, Square Enix announced Rise of the Tomb Raider for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4, with respective release dates of early 2016 and late 2016.[11] On August 4, 2015, at Microsoft Gamescom's press conference, it was confirmed that the game would release on November 13 in Europe.[12]\\r\\nA season pass was announced at October 7, 2015.[13] It adds additional tombs and an Endurance mode, which significantly increases the game's difficulty. In this mode, Lara has to search for food and fuel for survival. The mode was added to the game on December 29, 2015.[14] The season pass also comes with a new downloadable content called Baba Yaga: Temple of the Witch, which adds new tombs, puzzles and a new campaign featuring Baba Yaga to the base game. It was released on January 26, 2016.[15] The last DLC, titled Cold Darkness Awakened, was released on March 29, 2016.[16]\\r\\nOn July 19, 2016, a special edition of the game, Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration was announced for the PC and PlayStation 4 platforms for release on October 11, 2016, alongside a new DLC mission, Blood Ties (playable using PlayStation VR) and support for cooperative multiplayer in Endurance mode to be released on all platforms (except Xbox 360).[17]\\r\\nRise of the Tomb Raider was critically acclaimed. GameSpot's Mike Mahardy lauded the believability of the game's characters, as well as the addition of more tombs and the variety of options in combat. He concluded that \\"Crystal Dynamics has found equilibrium in almost every way.\\"[25] Lucy O'Brien of IGN praised the depiction of Lara and the world design. She claimed that the game is \\"the most fun Ive had with a Lara Croft game since 1996\\", and stated that it \\"takes its predecessor's winning formula and improves on it in every way\\".[28] Polygon's Philip Kollar awarded it a score of 8.5 out of 10, saying \\"This is the inauguration of Tomb Raider as a formula once more, but for now, it's a formula I'm happy revisiting.\\"[30]\\r\\nStephanie Bendixsen and Steven O'Donnell of Good Game both gave the game five stars. Bendixsen directed praise in particular to the game's combat, saying that she had \\"never had more fun with weapons in a game\\", and O'Donnell said that \\"Lara has really come into her own now, and it feels genuinely exciting to be going on this journey with her.\\"[32]\\r\\nKimberley Wallace of Game Informer awarded the game a 9.5 out of 10, stating \\"Rise of the Tomb Raider captures the thrill of being an adventurer and leaves you thinking about Lara's next move. You have daredevil sequences, heroic moments, fun exploration, and exciting fights that even Indiana Jones would envy. If Crystal Dynamics keeps raising the bar from here, I can't wait to see what's next for Lara.\\"[23]\\r\\nPeter Paras of Game Revolution gave it a perfect 5 star rating, saying that \\"...this is an adventure worth replaying with a hero who's unforgettable.\\"[24]\\r\\nIn August 2016, Rise of the Tomb Raider placed 18th on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time list.[33]\\r\\nIn the UK, Rise of the Tomb Raider suffered lower than expected sales, selling 63,000 units, less than two thirds than that of its predecessor.[34][35][36][37] Some gaming journalists have attributed the poor sales to the fact that the game released on the same day as Fallout 4.[38][39] Digitally, Rise of the Tomb Raider was the best selling Xbox One game during the week of Christmas.[40] By the end of 2015, the game had sold over 1 million copies.[41]\\r\\nThe retail version of Rise of the Tomb Raider was the fourth best selling game in its week of release in the UK and Ireland, debuting at No. 4 in the UK retail software sales chart.[42] Brian Horton, the game's director, and Aaron Greenberg, a Microsoft's executive, claimed that both Microsoft Studios and Square Enix were satisfied with the game's sales.[43]\\r\\nDigitally, the Windows version allegedly sold three times the amount of the Xbox One version in the first month of release.[44]\\r\\nAt Gamescom 2015, Square Enix accidentally revealed that a third game in the rebooted series was in development.[58]","input":"When did rise of the tomb raider release?"},{"output":"hydrogen (H2)","context":"Diatomic molecules are molecules composed of only two atoms, of the same or different chemical elements. The prefix di- is of Greek origin, meaning \\"two\\". If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as hydrogen (H2) or oxygen (O2), then it is said to be homonuclear. Otherwise, if a diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms, such as carbon monoxide (CO) or nitric oxide (NO), the molecule is said to be heteronuclear.\\r\\nThe only chemical elements that form stable homonuclear diatomic molecules at standard temperature and pressure (STP) (or typical laboratory conditions of 1 bar and 25?C) are the gases hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), fluorine (F2), and chlorine (Cl2).[1]\\r\\nThe noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon) are also gases at STP, but they are monatomic. The homonuclear diatomic gases and noble gases together are called \\"elemental gases\\" or \\"molecular gases\\", to distinguish them from other gases that are chemical compounds.[2]\\r\\nAt slightly elevated temperatures, the halogens bromine (Br2) and iodine (I2) also form diatomic gases.[3] All halogens have been observed as diatomic molecules, except for astatine, which is uncertain.\\r\\nOther elements form diatomic molecules when evaporated, but these diatomic species repolymerize when cooled. Heating (\\"cracking\\") elemental phosphorus gives diphosphorus, P2. Sulfur vapor is mostly disulfur (S2). Dilithium (Li2) is known in the gas phase. Ditungsten (W2) and dimolybdenum (Mo2) form with sextuple bonds in the gas phase. The bond in a homonuclear diatomic molecule is non-polar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll other diatomic molecules are chemical compounds of two different elements. Many elements can combine to form heteronuclear diatomic molecules, depending on temperature and pressure.\\r\\nCommon examples include the gases carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen chloride (HCl).\\r\\nMany 1:1 binary compounds are not normally considered diatomic because they are polymeric at room temperature, but they form diatomic molecules when evaporated, for example gaseous MgO, SiO, and many others.\\r\\nHundreds of diatomic molecules have been identified[4] in the environment of the Earth, in the laboratory, and in interstellar space. About 99% of the Earth's atmosphere is composed of two species of diatomic molecules: nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The natural abundance of hydrogen (H2) in the Earth's atmosphere is only of the order of parts per million, but H2 is the most abundant diatomic molecule in the universe. The interstellar medium is, indeed, dominated by hydrogen atoms.\\r\\nDiatomic elements played an important role in the elucidation of the concepts of element, atom, and molecule in the 19th century, because some of the most common elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, occur as diatomic molecules. John Dalton's original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed water's formula to be HO, giving the atomic weight of oxygen as eight times that of hydrogen[citation needed], instead of the modern value of about 16. As a consequence, confusion existed regarding atomic weights and molecular formulas for about half a century.\\r\\nAs early as 1805, Gay-Lussac and von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called Avogadro's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules. However, these results were mostly ignored until 1860, partly due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no chemical affinity toward atoms of the same element, and partly due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro's law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.\\r\\nAt the 1860 Karlsruhe Congress on atomic weights, Cannizzaro resurrected Avogadro's ideas and used them to produce a consistent table of atomic weights, which mostly agree with modern values. These weights were an important prerequisite for the discovery of the periodic law by Dmitri Mendeleev and Lothar Meyer.[5]\\r\\nDiatomic molecules are normally in their lowest or ground state, which conventionally is also known as the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle X}\\r\\n\\r\\n state. When a gas of diatomic molecules is bombarded by energetic electrons, some of the molecules may be excited to higher electronic states, as occurs, for example, in the natural aurora; high-altitude nuclear explosions; and rocket-borne electron gun experiments.[6] Such excitation can also occur when the gas absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. The excited states are unstable and naturally relax back to the ground state. Over various short time scales after the excitation (typically a fraction of a second, or sometimes longer than a second if the excited state is metastable), transitions occur from higher to lower electronic states and ultimately to the ground state, and in each transition results a photon is emitted. This emission is known as fluorescence. Successively higher electronic states are conventionally named \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle A}\\r\\n\\r\\n, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle B}\\r\\n\\r\\n, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle C}\\r\\n\\r\\n, etc. (but this convention is not always followed, and sometimes lower case letters and alphabetically out-of-sequence letters are used, as in the example given below). The excitation energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the electronic state in order for the excitation to occur.\\r\\nIn quantum theory, an electronic state of a diatomic molecule is represented by\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle S}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the total electronic spin quantum number, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Lambda }\\r\\n\\r\\n is the total electronic angular momentum quantum number along the internuclear axis, and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nv\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle v}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the vibrational quantum number. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Lambda }\\r\\n\\r\\n takes on values 0, 1, 2, , which are represented by the electronic state symbols \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nҷ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Sigma }\\r\\n\\r\\n, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Pi }\\r\\n\\r\\n, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta }\\r\\n\\r\\n,.

The actual energy can be found by multiplying the given statistic by the product of c (the speed of light) and h (Planck's constant), i.e., about 1.99 G 10?25 Joule metres, and then multiplying by a further factor of 100 to convert from cm?1 to m?1.\\r\\nThe aforementioned fluorescence occurs in distinct regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, called \\"emission bands\\": each band corresponds to a particular transition from a higher electronic state and vibrational level to a lower electronic state and vibrational level (typically, many vibrational levels are involved in an excited gas of diatomic molecules). For example, N2 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle A}\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle X}\\r\\n\\r\\n emission bands (a.k.a. Vegard-Kaplan bands) are present in the spectral range from 0.14 to 1.45 m (micrometres).[6] A given band can be spread out over several nanometers in electromagnetic wavelength space, owing to the various transitions that occur in the molecule's rotational quantum number, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle J}\\r\\n\\r\\n. These are classified into distinct sub-band branches, depending on the change in \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle J}\\r\\n\\r\\n.[8] The \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle R}\\r\\n\\r\\n branch corresponds to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJ\\r\\n=\\r\\n+\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta J=+1}\\r\\n\\r\\n, the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle P}\\r\\n\\r\\n branch to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJ\\r\\n=\\r\\n?\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta J=-1}\\r\\n\\r\\n, and the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle Q}\\r\\n\\r\\n branch to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJ\\r\\n=\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta J=0}\\r\\n\\r\\n. Bands are spread out even further by the limited spectral resolution of the spectrometer that is used to measure the spectrum. The spectral resolution depends on the instrument's point spread function.\\r\\nThe molecular term symbol is a shorthand expression of the angular momenta that characterize the electronic quantum states of a diatomic molecule, which are eigenstates of the electronic molecular Hamiltonian. It is also convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two point masses connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies.\\r\\nThe translational energy of the molecule is given by the kinetic energy expression:\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle m}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the mass of the molecule and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nv\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle v}\\r\\n\\r\\n is its velocity.\\r\\nClassically, the kinetic energy of rotation is\\r\\nFor microscopic, atomic-level systems like a molecule, angular momentum can only have specific discrete values given by\\r\\nAlso, for a diatomic molecule the moment of inertia is\\r\\nSo, substituting the angular momentum and moment of inertia into Erot, the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule are given by:\\r\\nAnother type of motion of a diatomic molecule is for each atom to oscillateor vibratealong the line connecting the two atoms. The vibrational energy is approximately that of a quantum harmonic oscillator:\\r\\nThe spacing, and the energy of a typical spectroscopic transition, between vibrational energy levels is about 100 times greater than that of a typical transition between rotational energy levels.\\r\\nThe good quantum numbers for a diatomic molecule, as well as good approximations of rotational energy levels, can be obtained by modeling the molecule using Hund's cases.","input":"When do two atoms represent the same element?"},{"output":"Southern Baptist Convention","context":"Protestantism is the largest grouping of Christians in the United States with its combined denominations collectively accounting for about half the country's population or 150 million people. Simultaneously, this corresponds to around 20% of the world's total Protestant population. America has the largest number of Protestants of any country in the world. Baptists account for about one third of American Protestants. The Southern Baptist Convention is the largest single Protestant denomination in the United States with one-tenth of American Protestants.\\r\\nThe country's history is often traced back to the Pilgrim Fathers whose Brownist beliefs motivated their move from England to the New World. These English dissenters, who also happened to be Puritansand thereforeCalvinists, were first to settle in what was to become the Plymouth Colony. America's Calvinist heritage is often underlined by various experts, researchers and authors, prompting some to declare that the United States was \\"founded on Calvinism\\", while also underlining its exceptional foundation as a Protestant majority nation.[1][2][3] American Protestantism has been diverse from the very beginning with large numbers of early immigrants being Anglican, various Reformed, Lutheran, and also Anabaptist. In the next centuries, it diversified even more with the Great Awakenings throughout the country. American Protestantism has a special vitality, offering a wide array of branches and being arguably more diverse than that in any other country.\\r\\nProtestants are divided into many different denominations, which are generally classified as either \\"mainline\\" or \\"evangelical\\", although some may not fit easily into either category. Some historically African-American denominations are also classified as Black churches. Protestantism had undergone an unprecedented development on American soil, diversifying into multiple branches, denominations, several interdenominational and related movements, as well as many other developments. All have since expanded on a worldwide scale mainly through missionary work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProtestants in the United States by tradition according to the Pew Research Center (2014)[4]\\r\\nProtestants in the United States by branch according to the Pew Research Center (2014)[4]\\r\\nProtestants in the United States by denomination according to the Pew Research Center (2014)[4]\\r\\nBaptists are the largest Protestant grouping in the United States accounting for one-third of all American Protestants.\\r\\nPrior to 1845, most white Baptist churches were loosely affiliated as the Triennial Convention. In that year, most southern congregations left to form a new Southern Baptist Convention, which is now the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S., with 15.7 million members. The remaining members organized what is now American Baptist Churches USA and includes 1.3 million members and 5402 congregations.[5]\\r\\nAfrican American Baptists, excluded from full participation in white Baptist organizations, have formed several denominations, of which the largest are the National Baptist Convention, with 7.5?million members and the more liberal Progressive National Baptist Convention (PNBC), with over 2000 churches and a total membership of 2.5?million.\\r\\nThere are numerous smaller bodies, some recently organized and others with long histories, such as the Calvinistic Baptists, General Baptists, Primitive Baptists, Old Regulars, Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists, independents, and Seventh Day Baptists.\\r\\nBaptists have been present in the part of North America that is now the United States since the early 17th century. Both Roger Williams and John Clarke, his compatriot in working for religious freedom, are credited with founding the Baptist faith in North America.[6] In 1639, Williams established a Baptist church in Providence, Rhode Island (First Baptist Church in America) and Clarke began a Baptist church in Newport, Rhode Island (First Baptist Church in Newport). According to a Baptist historian who has researched the matter, \\"There is much debate over the centuries as to whether the Providence or Newport church deserved the place of 'first' Baptist congregation in America. Exact records for both congregations are lacking.\\"[7]\\r\\nThe Handbook of Denominations in the United States identifies and describes 31 Baptist groups or conventions in the United States.[8] A partial list follows. (Unless otherwise noted, statistics are taken from the Baptist World Alliance website, and reflect 2006 data.)[9]\\r\\nWith 4.7?million members, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is the largest American Lutheran denomination, followed by the Lutheran ChurchÿMissouri Synod (LCMS) with 2.4?million members, and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) with 410,000 members. The differences between the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Lutheran ChurchÿMissouri Synod (LCMS) largely arise from historical and cultural factors, although some are theological in character. The ELCA tends to be more involved in ecumenical endeavors than the LCMS.\\r\\nWhen Lutherans came to North America, they started church bodies that reflected, to some degree, the churches left behind. Many maintained their immigrant languages until the early 20th century. They sought pastors from the \\"old country\\" until patterns for the education of clergy could be developed in America. Eventually, seminaries and church colleges were established in many places to serve the Lutheran churches in North America and, initially, especially to prepare pastors to serve congregations.\\r\\nThe LCMS sprang from German immigrants fleeing the forced Prussian Union, who settled in the St. Louis area and has a continuous history since it was established in 1847. The LCMS is the second largest Lutheran church body in North America (2.7?million). It identifies itself as a church with an emphasis on biblical doctrine and faithful adherence to the historic Lutheran confessions. Insistence by some LCMS leaders on a strict reading of all passages of Scripture led to a rupture in the mid-1970s, which in turn resulted in the formation of the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, now part of the ELCA.\\r\\nAlthough its strongly conservative views on theology and ethics might seem to make the LCMS politically compatible with other Evangelicals in the U.S., the LCMS as an organization largely eschews political activity, partly out of its strict understanding of the Lutheran distinction between the Two Kingdoms. It does, however, encourage its members to be politically active, and LCMS members are often involved in political organizations such as Lutherans for Life.\\r\\nThe earliest predecessor synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was constituted on August 25, 1748, in Philadelphia. It was known as the Ministerium of Pennsylvania and Adjacent States. The ELCA is the product of a series of mergers and represents the largest (4.7?million members) Lutheran church body in North America. The ELCA was created in 1988 by the uniting of the 2.85-million-member Lutheran Church in America, 2.25-million-member American Lutheran Church, and the 100,000-member Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches. The ALC and LCA had come into being in the early 1960s, as a result of mergers of eight smaller ethnically-based Lutheran bodies.\\r\\nThe ELCA, through predecessor church bodies, is a founding member of the Lutheran World Federation, World Council of Churches and the National Council of Churches USA. The LCMS, maintaining its position as a confessional church body emphasizing the importance of full agreement in the teachings of the Bible, does not belong to any of these. However, it is a member of the International Lutheran Council, made up of over 30 Lutheran Churches worldwide that support the confessional doctrines of the Bible and the Book of Concord. The WELS, along with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS), are part of the international Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC).\\r\\nPentecostalism is a renewalist religious movement within Protestantism, that places special emphasis on a direct personal experience of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit.[12] The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost, a Greek term describing the Jewish Feast of Weeks. For Christians, this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit and Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power, worship styles and teachings that were found in the early church.\\r\\nPentecostalism is an umbrella term that includes a wide range of different theological and organizational perspectives. As a result, there is no single central organization or church that directs the movement. Most Pentecostals consider themselves to be part of broader Christian groups; for example, most Pentecostals identify as Protestants. Many embrace the term Evangelical, while others prefer Restorationist. Pentecostalism is theologically and historically close to the Charismatic Movement, as it significantly influenced that movement; some Pentecostals use the two terms interchangeably.\\r\\nWithin classical Pentecostalism there are three major orientations: Wesleyan-Holiness, Higher Life, and Oneness.[13] Examples of Wesleyan-Holiness denominations include the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) and the International Pentecostal Holiness Church (IPHC). The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel is an example of the Higher Life branch, while the Assemblies of God (AG) was influenced by both groups.[13][14] Some Oneness Pentecostal (Nontrinitarian) churches include the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI) and Pentecostal Assemblies of the World (PAW). Many Pentecostal sects are affiliated with the Pentecostal World Conference.\\r\\nIn typical usage, the term mainline is contrasted with evangelical. The distinction between the two can be due as much to sociopolitical attitude as theological doctrine, although doctrinal differences may exist as well. Theologically conservative critics accuse the mainline churches of \\"the substitution of leftist social action for Christian evangelizing, and the disappearance of biblical theology,\\" and maintain that \\"All the Mainline churches have become essentially the same church: their histories, their theologies, and even much of their practice lost to a uniform vision of social progress.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) counts 26,344,933 members of mainline churches versus 39,930,869 members of evangelical Protestant churches.[16] There is evidence that there has been a shift in membership from mainline denominations to evangelical churches.[17]\\r\\nAs shown in the table below, some denominations with similar names and historical ties to evangelical groups are considered mainline. For example, while the American Baptist Churches, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and the Presbyterian Church (USA) are mainline, the Southern Baptist Convention, Lutheran ChurchÿMissouri Synod, and the Presbyterian Church in America are grouped as evangelical.\\r\\nThe mainline or mainline Protestant Christian denominations are those Protestant denominations that were brought to the United States by its historic immigrant groups; for this reason they are sometimes referred to as heritage churches.[19] The largest are the Episcopal (English), Presbyterian (Scottish), Methodist (English and Welsh), and Lutheran (German and Scandinavian) churches.\\r\\nMany mainline denominations teach that the Bible is God's word in function, but tend to be open to new ideas and societal changes.[20] They have been increasingly open to the ordination of women. Mainline churches tend to belong to organizations such as the National Council of Churches and World Council of Churches.\\r\\nMainline Protestant denominations, such as the Episcopal Church (76%),[21] the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (64%),[21] and the United Church of Christ (46%),[22][23] have the highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita of any other Christian denomination in the United States,[24] as well as the most high-income earners.[25]\\r\\nEpiscopalians and Presbyterian tend to be considerably wealthier[26] and better educated than most other religious groups in Americans,[27] and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business,[28] law and politics, especially the Republican Party.[29] Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and Astors, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Whitneys, Morgans and Harrimans are Mainline Protestantism families.[26]\\r\\nThe seven largest U.S. mainline denominations were called by William Hutchison the \\"Seven Sisters of American Protestantism.\\"[30][31] in reference to the major liberal groups during the period between 1900 to 1960.\\r\\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives also considers these denominations to be mainline:[16]\\r\\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives has difficulties collecting data on traditionally African American denominations. Those churches most likely to be identified as mainline include these Methodist groups:\\r\\nEvangelicalism is a Protestant Christian movement in which adherents consider its key characteristics to be a belief in the need for personal conversion (or being \\"born again\\"), some expression of the gospel in effort, a high regard for Biblical authority and an emphasis on the death and resurrection of Jesus.[40] David Bebbington has termed these four distinctive aspects \\"conversionism\\", \\"activism\\", \\"biblicism\\", and \\"crucicentrism\\", saying, \\"Together they form a quadrilateral of priorities that is the basis of Evangelicalism.\\"[41]\\r\\nNote that the term \\"evangelical\\" does not equal Christian fundamentalism, although the latter is sometimes regarded simply as the most theologically conservative subset of the former. The major differences largely hinge upon views of how to regard and approach scripture (\\"Theology of Scripture\\"), as well as construing its broader world-view implications. While most conservative evangelicals believe the label has broadened too much beyond its more limiting traditional distinctives, this trend is nonetheless strong enough to create significant ambiguity in the term.[42] As a result, the dichotomy between \\"evangelical\\" vs. \\"mainline\\" denominations is increasingly complex (particularly with such innovations as the \\"emergent church\\" movement).\\r\\nThe contemporary North American usage of the term is influenced by the evangelical/fundamentalist controversy of the early 20th century. Evangelicalism may sometimes be perceived as the middle ground between the theological liberalism of the mainline denominations and the cultural separatism of fundamentalist Christianity.[43] Evangelicalism has therefore been described as \\"the third of the leading strands in American Protestantism, straddl[ing] the divide between fundamentalists and liberals.\\"[44] While the North American perception is important to understand the usage of the term, it by no means dominates a wider global view, where the fundamentalist debate was not so influential.\\r\\nEvangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of the world. At the same time, they criticized their fellow fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the Social Gospel as it had been developed by Protestant activists of the previous century. They charged the modernists with having lost their identity as evangelicals and the fundamentalists with having lost the Christ-like heart of evangelicalism. They argued that the Gospel needed to be reasserted to distinguish it from the innovations of the liberals and the fundamentalists.\\r\\nThey sought allies in denominational churches and liturgical traditions, disregarding views of eschatology and other \\"non-essentials,\\" and joined also with Trinitarian varieties of Pentecostalism. They believed that in doing so, they were simply re-acquainting Protestantism with its own recent tradition. The movement's aim at the outset was to reclaim the evangelical heritage in their respective churches, not to begin something new; and for this reason, following their separation from fundamentalists, the same movement has been better known merely as \\"Evangelicalism.\\" By the end of the 20th century, this was the most influential development in American Protestant Christianity.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe National Association of Evangelicals is a U.S. agency which coordinates cooperative ministry for its member denominations.\\r\\nAccording of Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States by Harriet Zuckerman, a review of American Nobel prizes winners awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American Nobel Prize Laureates have identified from Protestant background.[45] Overall, 84.2% of all the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in Chemistry,[45] 60% in Medicine,[45] and 58.6% in Physics[45] between 1901 and 1972 were won by Protestants.\\r\\nSome of the first colleges and universities in America, including Harvard,[46] Yale,[47] Princeton,[48] Columbia,[49] Brown, Dartmouth, Williams, Bowdoin, Middlebury, and Amherst, all were founded by Protestants, as were later Carleton, Duke,[50] Oberlin, Beloit, Pomona, Rollins and Colorado College.","input":"What is the largest protestant church in america?"},{"output":"Oscar Munoz","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nOscar Munoz (born January 1959) is an American businessman.

All three species are long-lived and highly resilient to harsh weather and bad soils. One of the three species, Pinus longaeva, is among the longest-lived life forms on Earth. The oldest Pinus longaeva is more than 5,000 years old,[1] making it the oldest known individual of any species.\\r\\nDespite their potential age and low reproductive rate, bristlecone pines, particularly Pinus longaeva, are usually a first-succession species, tending to occupy new open ground.[2] They generally compete poorly in less-than-harsh environments, making them hard to cultivate.[2] In gardens, they succumb quickly to root rot.[3] They do very well, however, where most other plants cannot even grow, such as in rocky dolomitic soils in areas with virtually no rainfall.[2]\\r\\nBristlecone pines grow in scattered subalpine groves at high altitude in arid regions of the Western United States. The name comes from the prickles on the female cones.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three closely related species of bristlecone pines:\\r\\nAt least some of the three species can hybridize in cultivation, but the ranges of wild populations do not overlap. The Colorado River and Green River produces a 160-mile (260?km) gap between the ranges of P. longaeva and P. aristata and the northern Owens Valley provides a 19-mile (30?km) gap between the ranges of P. longaeva and P. balfouriana.[7]\\r\\nBristlecone pines grow in isolated groves just below the tree line, between 5,600 and 11,200?ft (1,700 and 3,400?m) elevation on dolomitic soils.[4] The trees grow in soils that are shallow lithosols, usually derived from dolomite and sometimes limestone, and occasionally sandstone or quartzite soils. Dolomite soils are alkaline, high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. Those factors tend to exclude other plant species, allowing bristlecones to thrive.[8] Because of cold temperatures, dry soils, high winds, and short growing seasons, the trees grow very slowly. Even the tree's needles, which grow in bunches of five, can remain on the tree for forty years, which gives the tree's terminal branches the unique appearance of a long bottle brush.\\r\\nThe bristlecone pine's root system is mostly composed of highly branched, shallow roots, while a few large, branching roots provide structural support. The bristlecone pine is extremely drought tolerant due to its branched shallow root system, its waxy needles, and thick needle cuticles that aid in water retention.[7]\\r\\nThe wood is very dense and resinous, and thus resistant to invasion by insects, fungi, and other potential pests. The tree's longevity is due in part to the wood's extreme durability. While other species of trees that grow nearby suffer rot, bare bristlecone pines can endure, even after death, often still standing on their roots, for many centuries. Rather than rot, exposed wood, on living and dead trees, erodes like stone due to wind, rain, and freezing, which creates unusual forms and shapes.\\r\\nThe bristlecone pine has an intrinsically low rate of reproduction and regeneration, and it is thought that under present climatic and environmental conditions the rate of regeneration may be insufficient to sustain its population.[9] The species are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list.[9] The species are labeled under Least Concern (LC). The justification for this being that no subpopulations for Great Basin bristlecone pines are decreasing. Subpopulations seem to be increasing or remaining stable.[9] Many bristlecone pine habitats have been protected, including the Inyo National Forest's Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest in the White Mountains of California and the Great Basin National Park in Nevada,[10][11] where cutting or gathering wood is prohibited.[10]\\r\\nThe green pine needles give the twisted branches a bottle-brush appearance. The needles of the tree surround the branch an extent of about one foot near the tip of the limb.[12] The name bristlecone pine refers to the dark purple female cones that bear incurved prickles on their surface.[4][11] The dark color of these cones help to absorb heat. After maturity, which takes about two years, the cones will become brown in color.[12] These ancient trees have a gnarled and stunted appearance, especially those found at high altitudes,[7] and have reddish-brown bark with deep fissures.[13] As the tree ages, much of its vascular cambium layer may die. In very old specimens, often only a narrow strip of living tissue connects the roots to a handful of live branches. Even though the trees' needles may age, they still remain functional in regulating water and by their ability to photosynthesize.[7]\\r\\nBristlecone pines are known for attaining great ages. A specimen of Pinus longaeva located in the White Mountains of California is 7003506700000000000?5,067 years old according to measurements by Tom Harlan.[1] This is the oldest known individual tree in the world. The identity of the specimen is being kept secret by Harlan. Another well-known bristlecone from the White Mountains is Methuselah which is 7003484900000000000?4,849 years old. Its specific location is also being kept secret.[14]\\r\\nThe other two species, Pinus balfouriana and Pinus aristata are also long-lived, though not to the extreme extent of P. longaeva; specimens of both have been measured or estimated to be up to 3,000 years old.[15] It is believed that the longevity of the trees is related to the proportion of dead wood to live wood. This high ratio reduces respiration and water loss, thereby extending the life of the tree.[9]\\r\\nNote that trees that reproduce via cloning can be considered to be much older than bristlecone pines. A colony of 47,000 quaking aspen trees (nicknamed \\"Pando\\"), covering 106 acres (43?ha) in the Fishlake National Forest of the United States, has been estimated to be 80,000 years old, although tree ring samples date individual, above-ground, trees at only an average of about 130 years.[16][17]\\r\\nThe bristlecone pine is invaluable to dendroclimatologists, because it provides the longest continual climatically sensitive tree-ring chronologies on the planet. By cross-dating millennia-old bristlecone pine debris, some chronologies reach beyond 9,000 years before present.[7] In addition, ratios of stable carbon isotopes from bristlecone pine tree rings are sensitive to past variations in moisture availability. This information can be used to reconstruct precipitation changes in the past.[18]\\r\\nThe Rocky Mountain population is severely threatened by an introduced fungal disease known as white pine blister rust, and by pine beetles.[19] Another problem that the species face is climate change as temperatures have increased 0.5ÿ1?C within the past 30 years throughout the southern Rocky Mountain range. These changes in climate would mostly affect trees in higher elevations. With these problems, the genetic diversity within the species has become a concern.[20] It is noted that old specimens have, however, survived previous warmer periods.\\r\\nThis article incorporates text from the ARKive fact-file \\"Bristlecone pine\\" under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License and the GFDL.","input":"Where is the oldest bristlecone pine tree located?"},{"output":"New York","context":"","input":"Where is the city of new york located?"},{"output":"1,309","context":"The List of Ohio Townships provides an alphabetic list of the 1362 current and historic townships in Ohio.

It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Dominion of India on 15 August 1947. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the term \\"tricolour\\" (Hindi: ??????, translit.?Tira?g) almost always refers to the Indian national flag. The flag is based on the Swaraj flag, a flag of the Indian National Congress designed by Pingali Venkayya.[N 1]\\r\\nBy law, the flag is to be made of khadi, a special type of hand-spun cloth or silk, made popular by Mahatma Gandhi. The manufacturing process and specifications for the flag are laid out by the Bureau of Indian Standards. The right to manufacture the flag is held by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission, who allocates it to regional groups. As of 2009, the Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha has been the sole manufacturer of the flag.\\r\\nUsage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws relating to the national emblems. The original code prohibited use of the flag by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day. In 2002, on hearing an appeal from a private citizen, Naveen Jindal, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens. Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing. The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use in conjunction with other national and non-national flags.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a ratio of two by three (where the length of the flag is 1.5 times that of the width). All three stripes of the flag (saffron, white and green) are to be equal in width and length. The size of the Ashoka Chakra is not specified in the Flag code, but it has twenty-four spokes that are evenly spaced.[5] In section 4.3.1 of \\"IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag\\", there is a chart that details the size of the Ashoka Chakra on the nine specific sizes of the national flag.[3] In both the Flag code and IS1, they call for the Ashoka Chakra to be printed or painted on both sides of the flag in navy blue.[3][5] Below is the list of specified shades for all colours used on the national flag, with the exception of Navy Blue, from \\"IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag\\" as defined in the 1931 CIE Colour Specifications with illuminant C.[3] The navy blue colour can be found in the standard IS:1803-1973.[3]\\r\\nNote that the values given in the table correspond to CIE 1931 color space. Approximate RGB values for use may be taken to be: India saffron #FF9933, white #FFFFFF, India green #138808, navy blue #000080.[6] Pantone values closest to this are 130 U, White, 2258 C and 2735 C.\\r\\nGandhi first proposed a flag to the Indian National Congress in 1921. The flag was designed by Pingali Venkayya. In the centre was a traditional spinning wheel, symbolising Gandhi's goal of making Indians self-reliant by fabricating their own clothing. The design was then modified to include a white stripe in the centre for other religious communities, and provide a background for the spinning wheel. Subsequently, to avoid sectarian associations with the colour scheme, saffron, white and green were chosen for the three bands, representing courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively.[7]\\r\\nA few days before India became independent on 15 August 1947, the specially constituted Constituent Assembly decided that the flag of India must be acceptable to all parties and communities.[8] A modified version of the Swaraj flag was chosen; the tricolour remained the same saffron, white and green. However, the charkha was replaced by the Ashoka Chakra representing the eternal wheel of law. The philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who later became India's first Vice President and second President, clarified the adopted flag and described its significance as follows:\\r\\nA number of flags with varying designs were used in the period preceding the Indian Independence Movement by the rulers of different princely states; the idea of a single Indian flag was first raised by the British rulers of India after the rebellion of 1857, which resulted in the establishment of direct imperial rule. The first flag, whose design was based on western heraldic standards, were similar to the flags of other British colonies, including Canada and Australia; its blue field included the Union Flag in the upper-left quadrant and a Star of India capped by the royal crown in the middle of the right half. To address the question of how the star conveyed \\"Indianness\\", Queen Victoria created the Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India to honour services to the empire by her Indian subjects. Subsequently, all the Indian princely states received flags with symbols based on the heraldic criteria of Europe including the right to fly defaced British red ensigns.[10][11][12]\\r\\nIn the early twentieth century, around the coronation of Edward VII, a discussion started on the need for a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to be a common choice, to something more appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; Lord Curzon rejected it for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags.[13] Around this time, nationalist opinion within the realm was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The symbols that were in vogue included the Ganesha, advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Kali, advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Another symbol was the cow, or Gau Mata (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not suggest unity with India's Muslim population.[14]\\r\\nThe partition of Bengal (1905) resulted in the introduction of a new flag representing the Indian independence movement that sought to unite the multitude of castes and races within the country. The Vande Mataram flag, part of the Swadeshi movement against the British, comprised Indian religious symbols represented in western heraldic fashion. The tricolour flag included eight white lotuses on the upper green band representing the eight provinces, a sun and a crescent on the bottom red band, and the Vande Mataram slogan in Hindi on the central yellow band. The flag was launched in Calcutta bereft of any ceremony and the launch was only briefly covered by newspapers. The flag was not covered in contemporary governmental or political reports either, but was used at the annual session of the Indian National Congress. A slightly modified version was subsequently used by Madam Bhikaji Cama at the second International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart in 1907. Despite the multiple uses of the flag, it failed to generate enthusiasm amongst Indian nationalists.[15]\\r\\nAround the same time, another proposal for the flag was initiated by Sister Nivedita, a Hindu reformist and disciple of Swami Vivekananda. The flag consisted of a thunderbolt in the centre and a hundred and eight oil lamps for the border, with the Vande Mataram caption split around the thunderbolt. It was also presented at the Indian National Congress meeting in 1906.[16] Soon, many other proposals were initiated, but none of them gained attention from the nationalist movement.\\r\\nIn 1909, Lord Ampthill, former Governor of the Madras Presidency, wrote to The Times of London in the run up to Empire Day pointing out that there existed \\"no flag representative of India as a whole or any Indian province ... Surely this is strange, seeing that but for India there would be no Empire.\\"[17]\\r\\nIn 1916, Pingali Venkayya submitted thirty new designs, in the form of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.[18]\\r\\nIn the early 1920s, national flag discussions gained prominence across most British dominions following the peace treaty between Britain and Ireland. In November 1920, the Indian delegation to the League of Nations wanted to use an Indian flag, and this prompted the British Indian government to place renewed emphasis on the flag as a national symbol.\\r\\nIn April 1921, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his journal Young India about the need for an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the charkha or spinning wheel at the centre.[20] The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj, and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner, the red colour signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims. Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921, but it was not delivered on time, and another flag was proposed at the session. Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented; he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions. Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating that red stood for the sacrifices of the people, white for purity, and green for hope.[21]\\r\\nOn 13 April 1923, during a procession by local Congress volunteers in Nagpur commemorating the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Swaraj flag with the spinning wheel, designed by Pingali Venkayya, was hoisted. This event resulted in a confrontation between the Congressmen and the police, after which five people were imprisoned. Over a hundred other protesters continued the flag procession after a meeting. Subsequently, on the first of May, Jamnalal Bajaj, the secretary of the Nagpur Congress Committee, started the Flag Satyagraha, gaining national attention and marking a significant point in the flag movement. The satyagraha, promoted nationally by the Congress, started creating cracks within the organisation in which the Gandhians were highly enthused while the other group, the Swarajists, called it inconsequential.\\r\\nFinally, at the All India Congress Committee meeting in July, 1923, at the insistence of Jawaharlal Nehru and Sarojini Naidu, Congress closed ranks and the flag movement was endorsed. The flag movement was managed by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel with the idea of public processions and flag displays by common people. By the end of the movement, over 1500 people had been arrested across all of British India. The Bombay Chronicle reported that the movement drew from diverse groups of society including farmers, students, merchants, labourers and \\"national servants\\". While Muslim participation was moderate, the movement enthused women, who had hitherto rarely participated in the independence movement.[22]\\r\\nWhile the flag agitation got its impetus from Gandhi's writings and discourses, the movement received political acceptance following the Nagpur incident. News reports, editorials and letters to editors published in various journals and newspapers of the time attest to the subsequent development of a bond between the flag and the nation. Soon, the concept of preserving the honour of the national flag became an integral component of the independence struggle. While Muslims were still wary of the Swaraj flag, it gained acceptance among Muslim leaders of the Congress and the Khilafat Movement as the national flag.\\r\\nDetractors of the flag movement, including Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag as a symbol of national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use of the flag, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag.[24] The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.[25]\\r\\nA few days before India gained its independence in August 1947, the Constituent Assembly was formed. To select a flag for independent India, on 23 June 1947, the assembly set up an ad hoc committee headed by Rajendra Prasad and including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sarojini Naidu, C. Rajagopalachari, K. M. Munshi and B. R. Ambedkar as its members.\\r\\nOn 14 July 1947, the committee recommended that the flag of the Indian National Congress be adopted as the National Flag of India with suitable modifications, so as to make it acceptable to all parties and communities. It was also resolved that the flag should not have any communal undertones.[5] The spinning wheel of the Congress flag was replaced by the Chakra (wheel) from the Lion Capital of Ashoka. According to Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the chakra was chosen as it was representative of dharma and law. However, Jawaharlal Nehru explained that the change was more practical in nature, as unlike the flag with the spinning wheel, this design would appear symmetrical. Gandhi was not very pleased by the change, but eventually came around to accepting it.\\r\\nThe flag was proposed by Nehru at the Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947 as a horizontal tricolour of deep saffron, white and dark green in equal proportions, with the Ashoka wheel in blue in the centre of the white band. Nehru also presented two flags, one in Khadi-silk and the other in Khadi-cotton, to the assembly. The resolution was approved unanimously.[28] It served as the national flag of the Dominion of India between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950, and has served as the flag of the Republic of India since then.[8]\\r\\nThe design and manufacturing process for the national flag is regulated by three documents issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). All of the flags are made out of khadi cloth of silk or cotton. The standards were created in 1968 and were updated in 2008.[29] Nine standard sizes of the flag are specified by law.[1]\\r\\nIn 1951, after India became a republic, the Indian Standards Institute (now the BIS) brought out the first official specifications for the flag. These were revised in 1964 to conform to the metric system which was adopted in India. The specifications were further amended on 17 August 1968.[5] The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes, dye colour, chromatic values, brightness, thread count and hemp cordage. The guidelines are covered under civil and criminal laws and defects in the manufacturing process can result in punishments that include fines or jail terms.[30][31]\\r\\nKhadi or hand-spun cloth is the only material allowed to be used for the flag, and flying a flag made of any other material is punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, besides a fine. Raw materials for khadi are restricted to cotton, silk and wool. There are two kinds of khadi used: The first is the khadi-bunting which makes up the body of the flag, and the second is the khadi-duck, which is a beige-coloured cloth that holds the flag to the pole. The khadi-duck is an unconventional type of weave that meshes three threads into a weave, compared to the two threads used in conventional weaving. This type of weaving is extremely rare, and there are fewer than twenty weavers in India professing this skill. The guidelines also state that there should be exactly 150 threads per square centimetre, four threads per stitch, and one square foot should weigh exactly 205 grams (7.2?oz).[5][30][31][32]\\r\\nThere are four places in the country licensed to make the cloth for the national flag, they are in Karnataka, Marathwada, Barabanki in UP, and Banetha in Rajasthan.[33] The woven khadi is obtained from two handloom units in the Dharwad and Bagalkot districts of northern Karnataka. Currently, Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha based in Hubli is the only licensed flag production and supply unit in India.[31] Permission for setting up flag manufacturing units in India is allotted by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission, though the BIS has the power to cancel the licences of units that flout guidelines.[5] The hand-woven khadi for the National Flag was initially manufactured at Garag, a small village in the Dharwad district. A Centre was established at Garag in 1954 by a few freedom fighters under the banner of Dharwad Taluk Kshetriya Seva Sangh and obtained the Centre's licence to make flags.[5]\\r\\nOnce woven, the material is sent to the BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, the material, if approved, is returned to the factory. It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth. Care also has to be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours and only then can the flag be sold.[30][31]\\r\\nDisplay and usage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002 (successor to the Flag Code?ÿ India, the original flag code); the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950; and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.[5] Insults to the national flag, including gross affronts or indignities to it, as well as using it in a manner so as to violate the provisions of the Flag Code, are punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both.[34]\\r\\nOfficial regulation states that the flag must never touch the ground or water, or be used as a drapery in any form.[5] The flag may not be intentionally placed upside down, dipped in anything, or hold any objects other than flower petals before unfurling. No sort of lettering may be inscribed on the flag. When out in the open, the flag should always be flown between sunrise and sunset, irrespective of the weather conditions. Prior to 2009, the flag could be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances; currently, Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night, subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall flagpole and be well-illuminated.[5][35]\\r\\nThe flag should never be depicted, displayed or flown upside down. Tradition also states that when draped vertically, the flag should not merely be rotated 90degrees, but also reversed. One \\"reads\\" a flag like the pages of a book, from top to bottom and from left to right, and after rotation the results should be the same. It is considered insulting to display the flag in a frayed or dirty state, and the same rule applies to the flagpoles and halyards used to hoist the flag, which should always be in a proper state of maintenance.[1]\\r\\nThe original flag code of India did not allow private citizens to fly the national flag except on national days such as Independence Day or Republic Day. In 2001, Naveen Jindal, an industrialist used to the more egalitarian use of the flag in the United States where he studied, flew the Indian flag on his office building. The flag was confiscated and he was warned of prosecution. Jindal filed a public interest litigation petition in the High Court of Delhi; he sought to strike down the restriction on the use of the flag by private citizens, arguing that hoisting the national flag with due decorum and honour was his right as a citizen, and a way of expressing his love for the country.[36][37]\\r\\nAt the end of the appeals process, the case was heard by the Supreme Court of India; the court ruled in Jindal's favour, asking the Government of India to consider the matter. The Union Cabinet of India then amended the Indian Flag Code with effect from 26 January 2002, allowing private citizens to hoist the flag on any day of the year, subject to their safeguarding the dignity, honour and respect of the flag.[5] It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed; also, the right to fly the flag is a qualified right, unlike the absolute rights guaranteed to citizens, and should be interpreted in the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.[5]\\r\\nThe original flag code also forbade use of the flag on uniforms, costumes and other clothing. In July 2005, the Government of India amended the code to allow some forms of usage. The amended code forbids usage in clothing below the waist and on undergarments, and forbids embroidering onto pillowcases, handkerchiefs or other dress material.[38]\\r\\nDisposal of damaged flags is also covered by the flag code. Damaged or soiled flags may not be cast aside or disrespectfully destroyed; they have to be destroyed as a whole in private, preferably by burning or by any other method consistent with the dignity of the flag.[1]\\r\\nThe rules regarding the correct methods to display the flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted at an angle to the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings.[1]\\r\\nWhenever the flag is displayed indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it should always be on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be to the right of the audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.[1]\\r\\nThe flag, when carried in a procession or parade or with another flag or flags, should be on the marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.[1]\\r\\nThe privilege of flying the national flag on vehicles is restricted to the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister, Governors and Lieutenant Governors of states, Chief Ministers, Union Ministers, members of the Parliament of India and state legislatures of the Indian states (Vidhan Sabha and Vidhan Parishad), judges of the Supreme Court of India and High Courts, and flag officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The flag has to be flown from a staff affixed firmly either on the middle front or to the front right side of the car. When a foreign dignitary travels in a car provided by government, the flag should be flown on the right side of the car while the flag of the foreign country should be flown on the left side.[5]\\r\\nThe flag should be flown on the aircraft carrying the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister on a visit to a foreign country. Alongside the National Flag, the flag of the country visited should also be flown; however, when the aircraft lands in countries en route, the national flags of the respective countries would be flown instead. When carrying the president within India, aircraft display the flag on the side the president embarks or disembarks; the flag is similarly flown on trains, but only when the train is stationary or approaching a railway station.[1]\\r\\nWhen the Indian flag is flown on Indian territory along with other national flags, the general rule is that the Indian flag should be the starting point of all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the rightmost flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should be in front of the other flag, and to the right (observer's left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations, which may be placed to the right of the Indian flag.[1]\\r\\nWhen the Indian flag is displayed with non-national flags, including corporate flags and advertising banners, the rules state that if the flags are on separate staffs, the flag of India should be in the middle, or the furthest left from the viewpoint of the onlookers, or at least one flag's breadth higher than the other flags in the group. Its flagpole must be in front of the other poles in the group, but if they are on the same staff, it must be the uppermost flag. If the flag is carried in procession with other flags, it must be at the head of the marching procession, or if carried with a row of flags in line abreast, it must be carried to the marching right of the procession.[1]\\r\\nThe flag should be flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning. The decision to do so lies with the President of India, who also decides the period of such mourning. When the flag is to be flown at half mast, it must first be raised to the top of the mast and then slowly lowered. Only the Indian flag is flown half mast; all other flags remain at normal height.\\r\\nThe flag is flown half-mast nationwide on the death of the president, Vice-president or prime minister. It is flown half-mast in New Delhi and the state of origin for the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and Union Ministers. On deaths of Governors, Lt. Governors and Chief Ministers, the flag is flown at half-mast in the respective states and union territories.\\r\\nThe Indian flag cannot be flown at half-mast on Republic Day (26 January), Independence day (15 August), Gandhi Jayanti (2 October), National Week (6ÿ13 April) or state formation anniversaries, except over buildings housing the body of the deceased dignitary. However, even in such cases, the flag must be raised to full-mast when the body is moved from the building.\\r\\nObservances of State mourning on the death of foreign dignitaries are governed by special instructions issued from the Ministry of Home Affairs in individual cases. However, in the event of death of either the Head of the State or Head of the Government of a foreign country, the Indian Mission accredited to that country may fly the national flag at half-mast.\\r\\nOn occasions of state, military, central para-military forces funerals, the flag shall be draped over the bier or coffin with the saffron towards the head of the bier or coffin. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or burnt in the pyre.[1]","input":"When was national flag of india first displayed?"},{"output":"usually in the summer or fall","context":"An Atlantic hurricane or tropical storm is a tropical cyclone that forms in the Atlantic Ocean, usually in the summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only on the basis of location.[1] A hurricane is a storm that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nTropical cyclones can be categorized by intensity.  Tropical storms have one-minute maximum sustained winds of at least 39?mph (34?knots, 17?m/s, 63?km/h), while hurricanes have one-minute maximum sustained winds exceeding 74?mph (64?knots, 33?m/s, 119?km/h).[2] Most North Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between June 1 and November 30.[3] The United States National Hurricane Center monitors the basin and issues reports, watches, and warnings about tropical weather systems for the North Atlantic Basin as one of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for tropical cyclones, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent times, tropical disturbances that reach tropical storm intensity are named from a predetermined list. Hurricanes that result in significant damage or casualties may have their names retired from the list at the request of the affected nations in order to prevent confusion should a subsequent storm be given the same name.[5]  On average, in the North Atlantic basin (from 1966 to 2009) 11.3 named storms occur each season, with an average of 6.2 becoming hurricanes and 2.3 becoming major hurricanes (Category 3 or greater).[6] The climatological peak of activity is around September 11 each season.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2004, Catarina was the first hurricane-intensity tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Since 2011, the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center has started to use the same scale of the North Atlantic Ocean for tropical cyclones in the South Atlantic Ocean and assign names to those which reach 35?kn (65?km/h; 40?mph).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTropical cyclones are steered by the surrounding flow throughout the depth of the troposphere (the atmosphere from the surface to about eight miles (12?km) high). Neil Frank, former director of the United States National Hurricane Center, used the analogies such as \\"a leaf carried along in a stream\\" or a \\"brick moving through a river of air\\" to describe the way atmospheric flow affects the path of a hurricane across the ocean. Specifically, air flow around high pressure systems and toward low pressure areas influences hurricane tracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the tropical latitudes, tropical storms and hurricanes generally move westward with a slight tendency toward the north, under the influence of the subtropical ridge, a high pressure system that usually extends east-west across the subtropics.[8] South of the subtropical ridge, surface easterly winds (blowing from east to west) prevail.  If the subtropical ridge is weakened by an upper trough, a tropical cyclone may turn poleward and then recurve,[9] or curve back toward the northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies.  Poleward (north) of the subtropical ridge, westerly winds prevail and generally steer tropical cyclones that reach northern latitudes toward the east. The westerlies also steer extratropical cyclones with their cold and warm fronts from west to east.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally speaking, the intensity of a tropical cyclone is determined by either the storm's maximum sustained winds or lowest barometric pressure. The following table lists the most intense Atlantic hurricanes in terms of their lowest barometric pressure. In terms of wind speed, Hurricane Allen (in 1980) was the strongest Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, with maximum sustained winds of 190?mph (310?km/h). However, these measurements are suspect since instrumentation used to document wind speeds at the time would likely succumb to winds of such intensity.[12] Nonetheless, their central pressures are low enough to rank them among the strongest recorded Atlantic hurricanes.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOwing to their intensity, the strongest Atlantic hurricanes have all attained Category?5 classification. Hurricane Opal, the strongest Category?4 hurricane recorded, intensified to reach a minimum pressure of 916?mbar (hPa; 27.05?inHg),[13] a pressure typical of Category?5 hurricanes.[14] Nonetheless, the pressure remains too high to list Opal as one of the ten strongest Atlantic tropical cyclones.[11] Presently, Hurricane Wilma is the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, after reaching an intensity of 882?mbar (hPa; 26.05?inHg) in October?2005;[12] this also made Wilma the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide outside of the West Pacific,[15][16][17][18][19] where seven tropical cyclones have been recorded to intensify to lower pressures.[20] However, this was later superseded by Hurricane Patricia in 2015 in the east Pacific, which had a pressure reading of 872 mbar. Preceding Wilma is Hurricane Gilbert, which had also held the record for most intense Atlantic hurricane for 17?years.[21] The 1935 Labor Day hurricane, with a pressure of 892?mbar (hPa; 26.34?inHg), is the third strongest Atlantic hurricane and the strongest documented tropical cyclone prior to 1950.[11] Since the measurements taken during Wilma and Gilbert were documented using dropsonde, this pressure remains the lowest measured over land.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nHurricane Rita is the fourth strongest Atlantic hurricane in terms of barometric pressure and one of three tropical cyclones from 2005 on the list, with the others being Wilma and Katrina at first and sixth, respectively.[11] However, with a barometric pressure of 895?mbar (hPa; 26.43?inHg), Rita is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico.[23] Hurricanes Camille, Mitch, and Dean share intensities for the seventh strongest Atlantic hurricane at 905?mbar (hPa; 26.73?inHg).[22] The tenth place for most intense Atlantic tropical cyclone is Hurricane Maria listed to have deepened to a pressure as low as 908?mbar (hPa; 26.81?inHg).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones weakened prior to their eventual landfall or demise. However, three of the storms remained intense enough at landfall to be considered some of the strongest landfalling hurricanes?ÿ three of the eleven hurricanes on the list constitute the three most intense Atlantic landfalls in recorded history. The 1935?Labor Day hurricane made landfall at peak intensity, making it the most intense Atlantic landfall. Though it weakened slightly before its eventual landfall on the Yucatn Peninsula, Hurricane Gilbert maintained a pressure of 900?mbar (hPa; 26.58?inHg) at landfall, making its landfall the second strongest. Similarly, Hurricane Dean made landfall on the peninsula, though it did so at peak intensity and with a higher barometric pressure; its landfall marked the third strongest in Atlantic hurricane history.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nClimatology does serve to characterize the general properties of an average season and can be used as one of many other tools for making forecasts. Most storms form in warm waters several hundred miles north of the equator near the Intertropical convergence zone from tropical waves. The Coriolis force is usually too weak to initiate sufficient rotation near the equator.[25]  Storms frequently form in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the tropical Atlantic Ocean as far east as the Cape Verde Islands, the origin of strong and long-lasting Cape Verde-type hurricanes. Systems may also strengthen over the Gulf Stream off the coast of the eastern United States, wherever water temperatures exceed 26.5?C (79.7?F).[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough most storms are found within tropical latitudes, occasionally storms will form further north and east from disturbances other than tropical waves such as cold fronts and upper-level lows.  These are known as baroclinically induced tropical cyclones.[26]  There is a strong correlation between Atlantic hurricane activity in the tropics and the presence of an El Ni?o or La Ni?a in the Pacific Ocean. El Ni?o events increase the wind shear over the Atlantic, producing a less-favorable environment for formation and decreasing tropical activity in the Atlantic basin. Conversely, La Ni?a causes an increase in activity due to a decrease in wind shear.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Azores High hypothesis by Kam-biu Liu, an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the North American Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods (3000ÿ1400 BC, and 1000 AD to present), a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered toward the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period (1400 BC to 1000 AD), more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean.[28][29] Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP,[30] and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity has increased significantly during the past 500ÿ1000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.\\r\\n\\r\\nClimatologically speaking, approximately 97?percent of tropical cyclones that form in the North Atlantic develop between the dates of June?1 and November?30?ÿ dates which delimit the modern-day Atlantic hurricane season. Though the beginning of the annual hurricane season has historically remained the same, the official end of the hurricane season has shifted from its initial date of October?31. Regardless, on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside the limits of the season;[31] as of January?2016 there have been 66?tropical cyclones in the off-season, with the most recent being Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017.[11] The first tropical cyclone of the 1938 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed on January?3, became the earliest forming tropical storm and hurricane after reanalysis concluded on the storm in December?2012.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nHurricane Able in 1951 was initially thought to be the earliest forming major hurricane?ÿ a tropical cyclone with winds exceeding 115?mph (185?km/h)[nb 1]?ÿ however following post-storm analysis it was determined that Able only reached Category 1?strength which made Hurricane Alma of 1966 the new record holder; as it became a major hurricane on June?8.[11] Though it developed within the bounds of the Atlantic hurricane season,[11][31] Hurricane Audrey in 1957 became the earliest developing Category?4 hurricane on record after it reached the intensity on June?27.[34] However, reanalysis from 1956 to 1960 by NOAA downgraded Audrey to a Category 3, making Hurricane Dennis of 2005 the earliest Category 4 on record on July 8, 2005.[35] The earliest-forming Category?5 hurricane, Emily, reached the highest intensity on the SaffirÿSimpson hurricane wind scale on July?17, 2005.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the official end of the Atlantic hurricane season occurs on November?30, the dates of October?31 and November?15 have also historically marked the official end date for the hurricane season.[31] December, the only month of the year after the hurricane season, has featured the cyclogenesis of fourteen tropical cyclones.[11] Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005 was the latest tropical cyclone to attain tropical storm intensity as it did so on December?30. However, the second Hurricane Alice in 1954 was the latest forming tropical cyclone to attain hurricane intensity. Both Zeta and Alice were the only two storms to exist in two calendar years?ÿ the former from 1954 to 1955 and the latter from 2005 to 2006.[37] No storms have been recorded to exceed Category?1 hurricane intensity in December.[11] In 1999, Hurricane Lenny reached Category?4 intensity on November?17 as it took an unprecedented west to east track across the Caribbean; its intensity made it the latest developing Category?4 hurricane, though this was well within the bounds of the hurricane season.[38] Hurricane Hattie (October 27-November 1, 1961) was initially thought to have been the latest forming Category?5 hurricane ever documented,[39] though reanalysis indicated that a devastating hurricane in 1932 reached such an intensity at a later date.[11][32] Consequently, this made the hurricane the latest developing tropical cyclone to reach all four SaffirÿSimpson hurricane wind scale classifications past Category?1 intensity.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beginning of the hurricane season is most closely related to the timing of increases in sea surface temperatures, convective instability, and other thermodynamic factors.[40] Although June marks the beginning of the hurricane season, generally little activity occurs during the month with an average of 1 tropical cyclone every 2?years. Tropical systems usually form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the east coast of the United States.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1851, a total of 81 tropical storms and hurricanes formed in the month of June. During this period, two of these systems developed in the deep tropics east of the Lesser Antilles.[41] Since 1870, three major hurricanes have formed during June, most notably Hurricane Audrey in 1957. Audrey attained an intensity greater than that of any Atlantic tropical cyclone during June or July until Hurricanes Dennis and Emily of 2005.[42] The easternmost forming storm during June, Tropical Storm Ana in 1979, formed at 45W.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot much tropical activity occurs during the month of July, but the majority of hurricane seasons see the formation of one tropical cyclone during July. From an average of Atlantic tropical cyclone seasons from 1944 to 1996, the first tropical storm in half of the seasons occurred by 11 July, and a second formed by 8 August.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormation usually occurs in the eastern Caribbean Sea around the Lesser Antilles, in the northern and eastern parts of the Gulf of Mexico, in the vicinity of the northern Bahamas, and off the coast of The Carolinas and Virginia over the Gulf Stream.  Storms travel westward through the Caribbean and then either move towards the north and curve near the eastern coast of the United States or stay on a north-westward track and enter the Gulf of Mexico.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1851, a total of 105 tropical storms have formed during the month of July.[43] Since 1870, ten of these storms reached major hurricane intensity.  Only Hurricane Emily of 2005, the strongest July tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, attained Category 5 hurricane status during July, making it the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record.[42][44] The easternmost forming storm and longest lived during the month of July, Hurricane Bertha in 2008, formed at 22.9W and lasted 17 days.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nDecrease in wind shear from July to August contributes to a significant increase of tropical activity.[46] An average of 2.8 Atlantic tropical storms develop annually in August. On average, four named tropical storms, including one hurricane, occur by August 30, and the first intense hurricane develops by 4 September.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peak of the hurricane season occurs in September and corresponds with low wind shear[46] and the warmest sea surface temperatures.[47] The month of September sees an average of 3 storms a year.  By 24 September, the average Atlantic season features 7 named tropical storms, including 4 hurricanes. In addition, two major hurricanes occur on average by 28 September. Relatively few tropical cyclones make landfall at these intensities.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe favorable conditions found during September begin to decay in October. The main reason for the decrease in activity is increasing wind shear, although sea surface temperatures are also cooler than in September.[40] Activity falls markedly with 1.8 cyclones developing on average despite a climatological secondary peak around 20 October.[48]  By 21 October, the average season features 9 named storms with 5 hurricanes. A third major hurricane occurs after 28 September in half of all Atlantic tropical cyclone seasons.[6]  In contrast to mid-season activity, the mean locus of formation shifts westward to the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, reversing the eastward progression of June through August.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nWind shear from westerlies increases substantially through November, generally preventing cyclone formation.[40] On average, one tropical storm forms during every other November. On rare occasions, a major hurricane occurs. The few intense hurricanes in November include Hurricane \\"Cuba\\" in late October and early November 1932 (the strongest November hurricane on record peaking as a Category 5 hurricane), Hurricane Lenny in mid-November 1999, Hurricane Kate in late November 1985 which was the latest major hurricane formation on record until Hurricane Otto (a category 3 storm) of the 2016 hurricane season.[11] Hurricane Paloma was a very potent category 4 storm that made landfall in Cuba in early November 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the hurricane season is defined as beginning on June?1 and ending on November?30, there have been several off-season storms.[11] Since 1870, there have been 32 off-season cyclones, 18 of which occurred in May. In the same time span, nine storms formed in December, two in April, and one each in January, February and March.[42] During four years (1887,[49] 1953,[50] 2003, and 2007), tropical cyclones formed in the North Atlantic Ocean both during or before May and during December.[51] In 1887, four storms occurred outside the season, the most in a single year.[49] High vertical wind shear and low sea surface temperatures generally preclude tropical cyclone formation during the off-season.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nTropical cyclones have formed in all months.[42] Four tropical cyclones existed during the month of January, two of which formed during late December: the second Hurricane Alice in 1954/1955, and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005/2006. The only two hurricanes to form in January are a Category 1 hurricane in the 1938 season, and Hurricane Alex in the 2016 season. A subtropical storm in January also began the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season.[11] No major hurricanes have occurred in the off-season.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the number of storms in the Atlantic has increased since 1995, there is no obvious global trend. The annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 87?I?10. However, the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere.[58] In spite of that, there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing. In 2006, Kerry Emanuel stated, \\"Records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane (again considering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70% in the past 30?years or so, corresponding to about a 15% increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime.\\"[59] At the time, Emanuel theorized that increased heat from global warming was driving this trend, however, some argue that Emanuel's own research in 2008 refuted this theory. Others contend that the trend does not exist at all, but instead is a figment created by faulty readings from primitive 1970s-era measurement equipment.[citation needed] Vecchi and Knutson (2008) found a weakly positive, although not statistically-significant trend in the number of North Atlantic tropical cyclones for 1878ÿ2006, but also a surprisingly strong decrease in cyclone duration over this period.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 15, 2014, the journal Nature published a peer-reviewed submission from October 2013 by James P. Kossin, Kerry A. Emanuel, and Gabriel A. Vecchi that suggests that a poleward migration exists for the paths of maximum intensity of tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic.[61] The focus of the report is on the latitude at which recent tropical cyclones in the Atlantic are reaching maximum intensity. Their data indicates that during the past thirty years, the peak intensity of these storms has shifted poleward in both hemispheres at a rate of approximately 60?km per decade, amounting to approximately one degree of latitude per decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially, since five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have occurred since 1990. According to the World Meteorological Organization, recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has largely been caused by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions.[62] Pielke et al. (2008) normalized mainland U.S. hurricane damage from 1900ÿ2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade 1996ÿ2005 has the second most damage among the past 11 decades, with only the decade 1926ÿ1935 surpassing its costs. The most damaging single storm is the 1926 Miami hurricane, with $157?billion of normalized damage.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nOften in part because of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect.[64] Christopher Landsea et al. estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50ÿ70?year cycle, also known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.[66] Nyberg et al. reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early eighteenth century and found five periods averaging 3ÿ5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40ÿ60?years, and six other averaging 1.5ÿ2.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10ÿ20?years. These periods are associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Throughout, a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1ÿ2 per year.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough more uncommon since 1995, few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during 1970ÿ94.[68] Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926ÿ60, including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933, a record only recently exceeded in 2005, which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900ÿ25; however, many intense storms formed during 1870ÿ99. During the 1887 season, 19 tropical storms formed, of which a record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City. Some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as Category 4 in strength.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the Atlantic basin. Before the satellite era began in 1960, tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one, a ship reported a voyage through the storm, or a storm landed in a populated area.[64] The official record, therefore, could miss storms in which no ship experienced gale-force winds, recognized it as a tropical storm (as opposed to a high-latitude extra-tropical cyclone, a tropical wave, or a brief squall), returned to port, and reported the experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nProxy records based on paleotempestological research have revealed that major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia.[28][29][70] Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000ÿ1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3ÿ5 times. This millennial-scale variability has been attributed to long-term shifts in the position of the Azores High,[29] which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP,[30] and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3,000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500ÿ1000?years, just as the Gulf Coast was amid a quiescent period during the last millennium. Evidence also shows that the average latitude of hurricane impacts has been steadily shifting northward, towards the Eastern Seaboard over the past few centuries. This change has been sped up in modern times due to the Arctic Ocean heating up especially much from fossil fuel-caused global warming.[72]","input":"When do hurricanes occur in the atlantic ocean?"},{"output":"Famous in American colonial history for its role as a key passageway through the lower central Appalachians","context":"The Cumberland Gap is a narrow pass through the long ridge of the Cumberland Mountains, within the Appalachian Mountains, near the junction of the U.S. states of Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee.\\r\\nFamous in American colonial history for its role as a key passageway through the lower central Appalachians, it was an important part of the Wilderness Road and is now part of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park.\\r\\nLong used by Native Americans, the Cumberland Gap was brought to the attention of settlers in 1750 by Thomas Walker, a Virginia physician and explorer. The path was used by a team of frontiersmen led by Daniel Boone, making it accessible to pioneers who used it to journey into the western frontiers of Kentucky and Tennessee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cumberland Gap is one of many passes in the Appalachian Mountains but the only one in the continuous Cumberland Mountain ridge line.[2] It lies within Cumberland Gap National Historical Park and is located on the border of present-day Kentucky and Virginia, approximately 0.25 miles (0.40?km) northeast of the tri-state marker with Tennessee.[3]\\r\\nThe area surrounding Cumberland Gap National Historical Park is composed of sedimentary rock, which is formed by the compaction of particles of gravel, sand, silt, mud, and carbonate minerals from the repetitive rise and fall of shallow seas. Rocks in this region range from Cambrian to Pennsylvanian in age. The unique landscape seen today is a result of the uplift of sedimentary rock in conjunction with several million years of weathering and erosion. These features include narrow ridges, steep cliffs, overlooks, and natural gaps like the Cumberland Gap.[2] It is an example of a wind gap since water does not flow through it.[4]\\r\\nThe V-shaped gap serves as a gateway to the west. The base of the gap is about 300 feet (91?m) above the valley floor below even though the north side of the pass was lowered 20 feet (6.1?m) during the construction of Old U.S. Route 25E. To the south the ridge rises 600 feet (180?m) above the pass, while to the north the Pinnacle Overlook towers 900 feet (270?m) above (elevation 2,505 feet (764?m)).[3]\\r\\nBecause it is centrally located in the United States, the region around Cumberland Gap experiences all four seasons. The summers are typically sunny, warm and humid with average high temperatures in the mid to upper 80s F (29-32C). In the winter months, January through March, temperatures range in the 30s to 40s F (0s C) and are generally mild with rain and few periods of snow.[5]\\r\\nThe nearest cities are Middlesboro, Kentucky, and Harrogate, Tennessee.\\r\\nThe gap was formed by the development of three major structural features: the Pine Mountain Thrust Sheet, the Middlesboro Syncline, and the Rocky Face Fault. Lateral compressive forces of sedimentary rocks from deep layers of the Earth's crust pushing upward 320 to 200 million years ago created the thrust sheet. Resistance on the fault from the opposing Cumberland Mountain to Pine Mountain caused the U-shaped structure of the Middlesboro Syncline. The once flat-lying sedimentary rocks were now deformed roughly 40 degrees northwest. Further constriction to the northwest of Cumberland Mountain developed into a fault trending north-to-south called the Rocky Face Fault, which eventually cut through Cumberland Mountain. This combination of natural geological processes created ideal conditions for weathering and erosion of the rocks.[2]\\r\\nHowever, the discovery of the Middlesboro impact structure has proposed new details in the formation of Cumberland Gap. Less than 300 million years ago a meteorite, \\"approximately the size of a football field\\", struck the earth, creating the Middlesboro Crater.[2] One of three astroblemes in the state, it is a 3.7-mile (6.0?km) diameter meteorite impact crater[6] with the city of Middlesboro, Kentucky, built entirely inside it.[7] Detailed mapping by geologists in the 1960s led many to interpret the geological features of the area to be a site of an ancient impact.[2] In 1966 Robert Dietz discovered shatter cones in nearby sandstone, proving recent speculation. Shatter cones, a rock-shattering pattern naturally formed only during impact events, are found in abundance in the area. The presence of shatter cones found also helped confirm the origin of impact. In September 2003 the site was designated a Distinguished Geologic Site by the Kentucky Society of Professional Geologists.[6]\\r\\nWithout the Rocky Face Fault, it would have been difficult for pack-horses to navigate this gap and the gap in Pine Mountain near Pineville, and it would be improbable that wagon roads would have been constructed at an early date. Middlesboro is the only place in the world where coal is mined inside an astrobleme. Special mining techniques must be used in the complicated strata of this crater.[8]\\r\\nThe passage created by Cumberland Gap was well traveled by Native Americans long before the arrival of European-American settlers. The earliest written account of Cumberland Gap dates to the 1670s, by Abraham Wood of Virginia.[9]\\r\\nThe gap was named for Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, son of King George II of Great Britain, who had many places named for him in the American colonies after the Battle of Culloden.[10] The explorer Thomas Walker gave the name to the Cumberland River in 1750, and the name soon spread to many other features in the region, such as the Cumberland Gap. In 1769 Joseph Martin built a fort nearby at present-day Rose Hill, Virginia, on behalf of Walker's land claimants. But Martin and his men were chased out of the area by Native Americans, and Martin himself did not return until 1775.[11]\\r\\nIn 1775 Daniel Boone, hired by the Transylvania Company, arrived in the region leading a company of men to widen the path through the gap to make settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee easier. On his arrival Boone discovered that Martin had beaten him to Powell Valley, where Martin and his men were clearing land for their own settlement ÿ the westernmost settlement in English colonial America at the time.[12] By the 1790s the trail that Boone and his men built had been widened to accommodate wagon traffic and sometimes became known as the Wilderness Road.\\r\\nSeveral American Civil War engagements occurred in and around the Cumberland Gap and are sometimes called Battle of the Cumberland Gap. In June 1862, Union Army General George W. Morgan captured the gap for the Union. In September of that year, Confederate States Army forces under Edmund Kirby Smith occupied the gap during General Braxton Bragg's Kentucky Invasion. The following year, in a bloodless engagement in September 1863, Union Army troops under General Ambrose Burnside forced the surrender of 2,300 Confederates defending the gap, gaining Union control of the gap for the remainder of the war.\\r\\nIt is estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 migrants passed through the gap on their way into Kentucky and the Ohio Valley before 1810. Today 18,000 cars pass beneath the site daily, and 1.2 million people visit the park on the site annually. The park features many hiking trails.[13]\\r\\nU.S. Route 25E passed overland through the gap before the completion of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel in 1996. The original trail was then restored.[14]\\r\\nThe gap and associated historic resources were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district on May 28, 1980.[15]\\r\\nWithin the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park there are currently 855 known species of vascular plants identified, but that number is expected to increase with reports from National Park Service inventory and monitoring programs. There are 15 various vegetation communities throughout the park, with some of them in special locations, such as mountain bogs, low-elevation wetlands, and rocky bluffs.[16]\\r\\nOf the current 371 species of animals within the park, 33 are mammals, 89 are birds, 29 amphibians, 15 reptiles, 27 fish, and 187 are insects. Visitors to the park can expect to see gray squirrels, white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, songbirds, hawks, snakes, turtles, and perhaps black bear or bobcat.[17]","input":"What is the significance of the cumberland gap?"},{"output":"late April 2018","context":"Jesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. The musical started as a rock opera concept album before its Broadway debut in 1971. The musical is mostly sung-through, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the last week of Jesus's life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible.\\r\\nThe work's depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and the other characters. A large part of the plot focuses on the character of Judas, who is depicted as a tragic figure dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus steers his disciples and fearful for the harm that may result. Contemporary attitudes and sensibilities (as well as slang) pervade the lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional anachronisms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 30 AD, Judas Iscariot, a sullen member of the 12 apostles, expresses his concern over Jesus's rising popularity as a \\"king\\" and the negative repercussions that will have. He strongly criticises Jesus for accepting his followers' unrealistic views, and for not heeding his concerns (\\"Heaven on Their Minds\\"). While Judas still loves Jesus, he believes that Jesus is just a man, not God, and worries that Jesus's following will be seen as a threat to the Roman Empire which would then severely punish Jesus, his associates, and possibly the Jewish people as a whole. Judas's warning goes unheeded, as Jesus's followers have their minds set on going to Jerusalem with Jesus. As they ask Jesus for information about his plans for the future, Jesus will not give them any, since whatever will happen is determined by God (\\"What's the Buzz?\\").\\r\\nRecognizing that Jesus is irritated by the badgering and lack of understanding from his followers, Mary Magdalene tries to help Jesus relax. Judas is concerned that Jesus is associating with a woman of \\"her profession\\", as if she were a prostitute. It seems to Judas that Jesus is contradicting his own teaching, and he worries that this apparent lack of judgment will be used against Jesus and his followers (\\"Strange Thing Mystifying\\"). Jesus tells Judas that Mary is with him now, and unless Judas is without sin he should not judge the character of others. Jesus then reproaches his apostles for being \\"shallow, thick, and slow\\" and somewhat bitterly answers that not a single one of them cares about him. Mary Magdalene tries to assure Jesus that everything is alright while anointing him with oil (\\"Everything's Alright\\"). Judas angrily insists that the money used to obtain the oil should have been used to help the poor instead. Jesus sadly declines that he and his followers do not have the resources to alleviate poverty and that they should be glad for the privileges they have. He claims that once his followers no longer have him, they will lose their path.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Caiaphas, the High Priest of Israel, assembles the Pharisees together at the Sanhedrin to talk about Jesus and his disciples. According to the Pharisees, Jesus's growing following consists of Jews unwilling to accept the Romans as their rulers, and the priests believe that Jesus may come to be seen as a threat to the Roman Empire, and to the priesthood's integrity; if the Romans retaliate, many Jews will suffer, even those who are not following Jesus. Caiaphas then concludes that there could be great bloodshed and the stakes are \\"frighteningly high!\\". So, for the greater good, he suggests they should \\"crush him completely! So like John before him, this Jesus must die!\\", and the Pharisees concur upon his decision (\\"This Jesus Must Die\\"). As Jesus and his followers arrive exultantly in Jerusalem, they are confronted by Caiaphas, who demands that Jesus should postpone this parade, which Jesus says would be futile and change nothing, and he proceeds to greet the happy Israelites instead (\\"Hosanna\\"). As the crowd cheers him on, they suddenly ask, \\"Hey JC, JC, won't you die for me?\\" To this, Jesus visibly reacts with concern. Then, one of his apostles, Simon the Zealot, suggests that Jesus lead his mob in a war against Rome and gain absolute power (\\"Simon Zealotes\\"). Jesus rejects this suggestion, stating that none of his followers understand what true power is, nor do they understand his true message (\\"Poor Jerusalem\\").\\r\\nPontius Pilate, the governor of Judea, has had a dream, in which he meets with a Galilean (in the form of Jesus) and that he, Pilate, will receive all of the blame for the man's violent and mournful death, predicting the rise of Christianity (\\"Pilate's Dream\\"). Jesus arrives at the Temple in Jerusalem and finds that it has become a haven of sin and debauchery as it is being used for selling everything from usury and weapons to prostitutes and drugs; angered by this, Jesus drives everyone out (\\"The Temple\\"). Angry, disconsolate, and tired by his burden, Jesus is confronted by lepers, cripples, and beggars, all wanting to be healed. Even though he heals some, their number increases, and he is overwhelmed. Unable to solve everyone's problems, Jesus screams \\"HEAL YOURSELVES!!!\\" until he finds Mary Magdalene by his side, laying him to rest (\\"Everything's Alright (Reprise)\\"). While Jesus is asleep, Mary acknowledges that she is unconditionally in love with Jesus, unlike any man she has known before, and it frightens her (\\"I Don't Know How to Love Him\\").\\r\\nConflicted, Judas seeks out the Pharisees and promises to help them arrest Jesus, while belaboring that he is acting with unselfish motives and that Jesus himself would approve if he knew those motives (\\"Damned for All Time\\"). Sustaining his testimony, Caiaphas and Annas ask that Judas reveal the location of Jesus so that the authorities can apprehend him. In exchange for the information, Judas is offered thirty pieces of silver as a \\"fee\\" so that he can assuage his conscience by using the money charitably (\\"Blood Money\\"). Judas decides that it would be better to turn Jesus in before his popularity leads to the deaths of Jesus and his followers, Judas included. He reveals that on Thursday night, Jesus will be at the Garden of Gethsemane.\\r\\nAt what Jesus knows will be the Last Supper, he pours wine and passes bread for his apostles (\\"The Last Supper\\"). Very aware of the ordeal he faces, he is stung when the others pay little attention to him; \\"For all you care this wine could be my blood / For all you care this bread could be my body,\\" he remarks, alluding to (and anticipating) the Christian doctrine of the Eucharist. He asks them to remember him when they eat and drink; he predicts that Peter will deny him three times \\"in just a few hours\\" and that one of them will betray him. Judas, believing that Jesus already knows (\\"cut the dramatics, you know very well who\\"), admits he is the one and angrily accuses Jesus of acting recklessly and egotistically. Claiming he does not understand Jesus's decisions, he leaves to bring the Roman soldiers.\\r\\nThe remaining apostles fall asleep, and Jesus retreats to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray (\\"Gethsemane\\"). He admits to God his doubts, fears, and anger; that he is tired and has done all he can. He asks powerfully if any of it has meaning and implores God not let him suffer the horrible death that portends for him. He feels disillusioned with his quest as the Messiah, does not understand what it has achieved, and wishes to give up. Receiving no answer, Jesus realises that he cannot defy God's will, and surrenders to God. His prayer ends with a request that God take him immediately, \\"before I change my mind.\\"\\r\\nFinally, Judas arrives with Roman soldiers and identifies Jesus by kissing him on the cheek (\\"The Arrest\\"). While Jesus is being arrested, his apostles attempt to fight the soldiers, Jesus tells them to let the soldiers take him to Caiaphas. On the way, a mob (acting likeand sometimes represented asmodern-day news reporters) asks Jesus what he plans to do, but Jesus declines to comment. When Jesus is brought to trial before the Sanhedrin, Caiaphas demands if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus responds: \\"That's what you say, you say that I am.\\" This answer is affirmative according to Jewish custom, and that provides enough justification for the Pharisees to bring Jesus to Pilate. Meanwhile, Jesus's apostle Peter is confronted by an old man, a soldier and a maid, and Peter denies to each that he knows Jesus (\\"Peter's Denial\\"). Mary asks Peter why he denied Jesus, and Peter responds that he had to do it in order to save himself. Mary wonders how Jesus knew that Peter would deny him three times.\\r\\nLater, Pilate asks Jesus if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus gives the same answer that he gave Caiaphas: \\"that's what you say.\\"[1] Since Jesus is from Galilee, Pilate says that he is not under his jurisdiction and sends him to King Herod (\\"Pilate and Christ\\"). As Jesus is dragged away, the chorus asks where Jesus's power has gone. The decadent and flamboyant King Herod persuades Jesus to prove his divinity by performing miracles, offering to free him if he complies (\\"King Herod's Song (Try It And See)\\"), but Jesus ignores him. Herod decides that Jesus is just another phony messiah and angrily sends him back to Pilate. Meanwhile, Mary Magdalene, Peter, and the apostles remember when they first began following Jesus, and wish that they could return to a time of peace (\\"Could We Start Again, Please?\\")[2]\\r\\nLater, Judas is horrified upon beholding Jesus's harsh treatment by the authorities. Feeling extreme guilt for this, and panicking that he will be seen as responsible, Judas expresses regret to the pharisees, fearing he will forever be remembered as a traitor. Thankfully, Caiaphas and Annas never believe him, saying that what he has done now will save everyone and that he should not feel remorse for his actions. Although rewarded for a job well done, Judas recognizes that memories of this could haunt the rest of his life, that God chose him to be the one to betray Jesus, and that he has been used as a pawn for the \\"foul bloody crime\\". He suffers a mental breakdown during the epiphany, cursing God for his manipulative ways, and in a final attempt to detach himself from his destiny, he commits suicide by hanging himself from a tree (\\"Judas's Death\\").\\r\\nAt Jesus's trial, Pilate interrogates Jesus into revealing the whereabouts of his kingdom, but was cut off by a bloodthirsty mob who demands that Jesus should be sentenced to death by crucifixion. In spite of the mobs behavior,[3] Pilate remembers the dream he had about the mob and the unjust execution of Jesus. Pilate tells the mob that, while Jesus should be imprisoned, he does not deserve to die. Pilate demands that the crowd give him a reason to condemn Jesus, and the mob answers that Jesus is a blasphemer and has defied the Roman Empire. However, after revealing Jesus as nothing more than a pathetic human being, Pilate calls the crowd hypocrites, as he knows they hate Roman rule. Even so, he decides to satisfy their bloodlust by having Jesus flogged, counting thirty-nine bloody strokes (\\"Trial Before Pilate, (Including The Thirty-Nine Lashes)\\"). Pilate, clearly disturbed by the whole ordeal, pleads with Jesus to defend himself, but Jesus says weakly that everything has been determined, by God, and Pilate cannot change it. More outraged by Jesus's words, the crowd still calls for Jesus's death, informing Pilate that he has his duty to keep the peace. Finally, he reluctantly agrees to crucify Jesus to keep the crowd from getting violent, saying to Jesus: \\"Dont let me stop your great self-destruction! Die if you want to, you misguided martyr! I wash my hands of your demolition! Die if you want to, you ÿ innocent puppet....\\"\\r\\nAs Jesus prepares to be crucified, he is mocked by the ghost of Judas, who questions why Jesus chose to arrive in the manner and time that he did, and if what happened to him was really part of a divine plan, but Judas' questions go unanswered (\\"Superstar\\").[4] After reciting his final words and commending his spirit to God, Jesus slowly dies on the cross, his fate coming full circle (\\"The Crucifixion\\"). In the end, the Apostles and Mary, mourning the death of their fallen saviour, reflect on the impact he has had on their lives (\\"John Nineteen: Forty-One\\").[5]\\r\\n2 flutes, clarinet, 2 bassoons, 2 saxophones (one tenor), 6 horns, 4 trumpets, 2 trombones, drum set, percussion set, 6 guitars (1 acoustic, 2 electric, 4 bass), 5 pianos, electric piano, 3 organs, positive organ, and strings. Additional vocals are provided by a choir, a children's choir (\\"Overture\\"), and other singers (\\"Superstar\\").[6]\\r\\nAct One\\r\\nAct Two\\r\\n\\r\\nThe songs were first written and conceived as a concept album, before the musical was created and staged.[7] On the original album, the part of Jesus was sung by Ian Gillan, with Murray Head as Judas, Michael d'Abo as King Herod, Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene, and Barry Dennen as Pilate. In July 1971, the first authorised American concert of the rock opera took place in front of an audience of 13,000 people at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's Civic Arena with Jeff Fenholt singing the role of Jesus, Carl Anderson as Judas and Elliman repeating as Mary Magdalene.[8]\\r\\nThe musical opened on Broadway on 12 October 1971, directed by Tom O'Horgan, at the Mark Hellinger Theatre. It starred Jeff Fenholt as Jesus, Ben Vereen as Judas and Bob Bingham as Caiaphas. Dennen and Elliman played the roles that they had sung on the album. Kurt Yaghjian was Annas, and Ted Neeley (as a Christ understudy), Samuel E. Wright and Anita Morris appeared in the cast. Carl Anderson replaced Vereen when he fell ill, and the two performers later took turns playing the role. The show closed on 30 June 1973 after 711 performances. The production received mixed reviews; the bold casting of African-Americans as Judas was lauded, but reviewer Clive Barnes from The New York Times said, \\"the real disappointment was not in the music ... but in the conception.\\"[9][10] Lloyd Webber said in 2012: \\"I hugely objected to the original New York production, which was probably the worst night of my life. It was a vulgar travesty.\\"[7] The show was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Score, but didn't win any. Lloyd Webber won a Drama Desk Award as \\"Most Promising Composer\\", and Vereen won a Theatre World Award.\\r\\nThe Broadway show and subsequent productions were condemned by some religious groups. Tim Rice was quoted as saying \\"It happens that we don't see Christ as God but simply the right man at the right time at the right place.\\"[11][12] Some Christians considered such comments to be blasphemous, the character of Judas too sympathetic and some of his criticisms of Jesus offensive.[13] At the same time, some Jews claimed that it bolstered the antisemitic belief that the Jews were responsible for Jesus' death by showing most of the villains as Jewish (Caiaphas and the other priests, Herod) and showing the crowd in Jerusalem calling for the crucifixion.[14][15] The musical was banned in South Africa for being \\"irreligious\\".[16] A 1972 production of the play was banned in the Hungarian People's Republic for \\"distribution of religious propaganda\\".[17]\\r\\nSuperstar opened at the Palace Theatre in London in 1972, starring Paul Nicholas as Jesus, Stephen Tate as Judas and Dana Gillespie as Mary Magdalene. It was directed by Australian Jim Sharman. This production was much more successful than the original production on Broadway, running for eight years and becoming the United Kingdom's longest-running musical at the time. Dmitri Shostakovich attended this production in London just before his death. He regretted that he could not have composed something like it; he lauded especially a rock band underpinning full symphonic strings, brass and woodwind.[18]\\r\\nOne of the earliest foreign productions was a five-day run in Sweden at Scandinavium in Gothenburg, opening on 18 February 1972 and playing to 74,000 people (a record at the time). Starring as Mary Magdalene was Agnetha F?ltskog. On 16 March 1972 an oratorio version was performed at Memorial Drive Park in Adelaide, South Australia as part of the Adelaide Festival of the Arts.[19] This was followed in May by the first full Australian production, at the Capitol Theatre, Sydney, later moving to the Palais Theatre in Melbourne.[20] Sharman again directed, and the cast included Trevor White as Jesus, Jon English as Judas, and Michele Fawdon (1972ÿ1973) and Marcia Hines (1973ÿ1974) as Mary Magdalene. Hines was the first black woman to play the role. Other cast members included Reg Livermore, John Paul Young, Stevie Wright, and Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock, who met during the production and subsequently formed the band Air Supply. The production ran until February 1974.[citation needed] In June 1972 the show opened in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in Atelje 212 theatre, in adaptation by Jovan ?irilov.[21] The role of Jesus Christ was played by Korni Grupa vocalist Zlatko Pejakovi?, the role of Mary Magdalene by Azra Halinovi? and the role of Pontius Pilate by Branko Mili?evi?.[21] The premiere was directly broadcast by Radio Television of Belgrade.[21] Bora ?or?evi?[22] and Sr?an Marjanovi?, at the time a little known musicians, also participated as members of the choir.[23] The production was praised by the Yugoslav public.[21]\\r\\nIn 1973, the show opened in Paris at the Thatre de Chaillot in a French adaptation by Pierre Delano?. The title role was sung by Daniel Beretta, and Mary Magdalena was Anne-Marie David. The critics were unimpressed, and the production stopped after 30 performances.[citation needed] In the same year, Noel Pearson produced the show at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, Republic of Ireland, with Luke Kelly giving a critically acclaimed performance as King Herod.[24] In 1974, first Spanish-language production ran in Mexico with the title \\"Jesucristo Super Estrella\\". Julissa played Mary Magdalen. The musical was seen in 1974 in Peru and Singapore.[25]\\r\\nRobert Stigwood launched two road touring companies in 1971 to cover North America, with Robert Corff and Tom Westerman as Jesus, respectively.[citation needed] The first major US National Tour, however began In 1976, managed by Laura Shapiro Kramer. The tour continued until 1980. In 1977, the show had its first Broadway revival, running from 23 November 1977 to 12 February 1978. It was directed by William Daniel Grey, with choreography by Kelly Carrol and starred William Daniel Grey as Jesus, Patrick Jude as Judas, and Barbara Niles as Mary Magdalene.[26] Regional productions followed.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1981, Emilio de Soto directed an English-language version in Venezuela, with 163 actors.[citation needed] From 1982 to 1984, an Australian production toured Australia and South-East Asia, directed by Trevor White, who also reprised his role of Jesus. The cast included Doug Parkinson as Judas and Marcia Hines (reprising her role as Mary Magdalene).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe North American touring revival of Superstar in 1992 starred Neeley and Anderson reprising their respective Broadway and 1973 film roles as Jesus and Judas, receiving positive reviews for their performances. This production also starred both Dennis DeYoung as Pilate, and Syreeta and Irene Cara sharing Mary Magdalene. Originally expected to run for three to four months, the tour ended up running for five years. Replacements in this tour included Jason Raize as Pontius Pilate and Simone as the Maid by the Fire and understudy for Mary. In 1994, a New Zealand production starred Darryl Lovegrove as Jesus, Jay Laga'aia as Judas and Frankie Stevens as Caiaphas. Also in 1994, a stage version titled Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection was performed in Atlanta, Austin and Seattle featuring Amy Ray as Jesus, Emily Saliers as Mary Magdalene and Michael Lorant as Judas.\\r\\nIn 1996, the musical was revived in London at the Lyceum Theatre and ran for a year and a half. Directed by Gale Edwards, it starred Steve Balsamo and Zubin Varla as Jesus and Judas, and Joanna Ampil as Mary Magdalene and Alice Cooper as King Herod. The production was nominated for a Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival but did not win. It was followed by a UK tour. This production was revived on Broadway at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts in 2000, starring Glenn Carter as Jesus and Tony Vincent as Judas. It opened to mixed reviews and ran for 161 performances.[27] It was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical but did not win. In 2002, a national tour starred Sebastian Bach as Jesus and Anderson once again as Judas. Bach received mixed reviews while Anderson was again praised. In April 2003, Bach was replaced by Eric Kunze. Anderson left the show later in 2003 after being diagnosed with leukaemia and died in 2004. The tour closed shortly after Anderson's departure.\\r\\nIn 2004 a year-long UK tour began, directed by Bob Tomson and Bill Kenwright. Carter reprised his role as Jesus, with James Fox as Judas. In 2005, a successful Scandinavian tour starred Australian Peter Murphy (Jesus), American Kristen Cummings (Mary), Englishman Jon Boydon ne Stokes (Judas), Frenchman Jr?me Pradon (King Herod) and Australian Michael-John Hurney (Pilate). A US tour starring Neeley, reprising his role as Jesus and Corey Glover as Judas, began in 2006 and played for five years. A Chilean heavy metal version has played annually in Santiago since 2004.[28] In Boston, Gary Cherone portrayed Jesus in productions in 1994, 1996 and 2003 and Judas in 2000.\\r\\nA new production of Jesus Christ Superstar was mounted at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, in Stratford, Ontario, in 2011. Directed by Des McAnuff, the cast starred Paul Nolan as Jesus, Josh Young as Judas, Brent Carver as Pilate, Chilina Kennedy as Mary Magdalene, Bruce Dow as Herod and Melissa O'Neil as Martha. This moved to La Jolla Playhouse later in the year and transferred to the Neil Simon Theatre on Broadway in 2012, with Tom Hewitt taking over the role of Pilate.[29] Reviews were mixed.[30][31] The revival was nominated for two Tonys: Best Revival and, for Young, Best Actor.[32] Neither award was won, but Young won a Theatre World Award. The revival closed after 116 performances and 24 previews.[33]\\r\\nThrough a 2012 ITV competition TV show called Superstar, produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber, the UK public chose Ben Forster for the role of Jesus in an arena tour of the musical, beginning at O2 in September 2012.[34][7] The production also starred Tim Minchin as Judas, Melanie C as Mary Magdalene and Chris Moyles as King Herod.[35] Lloyd Webber stated, \\"The funny thing is that Jesus Christ Superstar [as a rock concert] is what we actually intended it to be. When it is done in a conventional proscenium theatre production it feels shoe-horned in. That is why I wanted to do this.\\"[7] The tour resumed in March 2013 in the UK, and an Australian leg of the tour commenced in Perth in May 2013.[36] Andrew O'Keefe played King Herod in Australia, with Jon Stevens as Pilate. Stevens had played Judas in an Australian arena tour in 1992.[37][38]\\r\\nIn 2016, celebrating 45 years since the musical debuted on Broadway, Jesus Christ Superstar returned to London at Regent's Park Open Air Theatre, directed by Timothy Sheader. The production won the BBC Radio 2 Audience Award for Best Musical at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards,[39] and a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival.[40] The production returned to the Open Air Theatre as part of the 2017 season, running from 11 August 2017 to 23 September.[41] Additionally, the Lyric Opera of Chicago is hosting a run of the opera from late April 2018 to late May 2018. [42]\\r\\nTwo notable Jesuses were Takeshi Kaga, in the 1976 Japanese production, and Camilo Sesto in the 1975 Spanish production[why?]. Mary Magdalene was Roco Banquells in a 1981 production in Mexico. A Czech version premiered in 1994 in Prague's Spirla Theatre and ran until 1998, with 1288 performances.[43] In the 2000s, a Venezuelan production ran for two years (2006ÿ2008), directed by Michel Hausmann. A Spanish production produced by Stage Entertainment ran from 2007 to 2009, followed by long-running productions in Italy and Sweden (featuring Ola Salo) and Norway.\\r\\nConcerts of the show have been mounted in Vienna, Austria, since 1981, including one on Easter of 2015 starring Drew Sarich in the title role.[44]\\r\\nIn 2010, an Australian production presented by Harvest Rain Theatre Company was directed by Tim O'Connor. Luke Kennedy appeared as Jesus, Naomi Price as Mary, Tod Strike as Judas, and Steven Tandy as Herod. A 2017 Professional Australian Production was staged at the Arts Centre Melbourne and starred Rob Mills as Jesus.\\r\\nA 2014 production in S?o Paulo, Brazil starred Igor Rickli as Jesus. Negra Li was Mary Magdalene.[45] A 2014 production in Lima, Peru, at the Sarita Colonia prison, as part of a rehabilitation program for inmates, received some press.[46] Eighty prisoners mounted the production, directed by inmate Freddy Battifora, who also played the role of Jesus.[47] The Catholic Church approved of the production.[47]\\r\\nThe original 1970 concept album was very popular; its 1971 release topped the US Billboard Pop Albums.[48] The 1972 and 1992 Australian cast recordings were also both highly successful.[49]\\r\\nIn 1994, a studio recording under the name of Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection was released.\\r\\nA 1996 radio production for BBC Radio 2 starred Tony Hadley as Jesus, Roger Daltrey as Judas, Frances Ruffelle as Mary Magdalene and Julian Clary as King Herod; this production was re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 6 August 2016.[50]\\r\\nA film adaptation of Jesus Christ Superstar was released in 1973 and was the eighth highest-grossing film of that year. The film, directed by Norman Jewison, was shot in Israel[51] and other Middle Eastern locations. Ted Neeley, Carl Anderson and Yvonne Elliman were each nominated for a Golden Globe Award for their portrayals of Jesus, Judas and Mary Magdalene, respectively. Bob Bingham (Caiaphas) and Barry Dennen (Pilate) also reprised their roles. Though it attracted criticism from some religious groups, the film was generally well received.[citation needed] A new song, called \\"Then We Are Decided\\" and phrased as a dialogue between Caiaphas and Annas, was written and composed for this adaptation.\\r\\nA second adaptation was filmed in 1999, and released around the world on video in 2000 and 2001.[52] It starred Glenn Carter as Jesus, Jr?me Pradon as Judas, Rene Castle as Mary Magdalene, and Rik Mayall as Herod, and was directed by Gale Edwards and Nick Morris. It was released on video in the UK in October 2000.[53] In the U.S. it was released on VHS and DVD in March 2001, and aired on PBS's Great Performances series in April 2001.[54] It won the International Emmy Award for Best Performing Arts Film in November 2001.[55] The style of the film is more like the stage version than the location-based 1973 adaptation, and it used many of the ideas from the 1996ÿ1999 UK production.[52]\\r\\nOn Easter Sunday, April 1, 2018, NBC aired a live concert version of the show featuring John Legend as Jesus, Sara Bareilles as Mary Magdalene, Brandon Victor Dixon as Judas, Alice Cooper as King Herod, Norm Lewis as Caiaphas, Ben Daniels as Pilate, Jin Ha as Annas, Erik Gr?nwall as Simon Zealotes and Jason Tam as Peter.[56]","input":"When did jesus christ superstar open in chicago?"},{"output":"seven","context":"The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom has a seven-group system.

The timed runs are combined to calculate the final score.\\r\\nThe various types of sleds came several years before the first tracks were built in St. Moritz, Switzerland, where the original bobsleds were adapted upsized luge/skeleton sleds designed by the adventurously wealthy to carry passengers. All three types were adapted from boys' delivery sleds and toboggans.\\r\\nCompetition naturally followed, and to protect the working class and rich visitors in the streets and byways of St Moritz, bobsledding was eventually banned from the public highway. In the winter of 1903/1904 the Badrutt family, owners of the historic Kulm Hotel and the Palace Hotel, allowed Emil Thoma to organise the construction of the first familiarly configured 'half-pipe' track in the Kulm Hotel Park, ending in the village of Cresta. It has hosted the sport during two Olympics and is still in use today.\\r\\nInternational bobsleigh competitions are governed by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, also known as FIBT from the French Fdration Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing. National competitions are often governed by bodies such as the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation and Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name is derived from the action some early competitors adopted of bobbing back and forth inside their sleds to increase speed.[1]\\r\\nAlthough sledding on snow or ice had long been popular in many northern countries, the origins of bobsleighing as a modern sport are relatively recent. Its foundation began when hotelier Caspar Badrutt (1848ÿ1904) convinced some English regulars to remain through the entire winter at his hotel in the mineral spa town of St. Moritz, Switzerland. Keeping them entertained with food, alcohol, and activities, he quickly established the concept of \\"winter resorting\\". Badrutt has done it because he was annoyed his regular English clientele were only staying at his hotel during the summer months. It only took a couple of years for wintering at Badrutt's St Moritz hotel to become very fashionable in Victorian Britain. But increased numbers led some guests to search for new diversions. In the early 1870s some adventurous English guests began adapting boys' delivery sleds for recreational purposes. However, they soon began colliding with pedestrians in the icy lanes, alleyways and roads of St Moritz.\\r\\nGuests soon began to invent \\"steering means\\" for the sleds. This led to the development of the bobsleigh (bobsled): two cresta's (skeleton sleds) attached together with a board that had a steering mechanism at the front. However, the impetus to steer the sleds permitted longer runs through the town. Longer runs also meant higher speeds on curves. Local sentiments varied about these informal competitions but eventually complaints grew so vociferous that Badrutt was forced to take action. His solution was to build a basic natural ice run for his guests near the town. Badrutt had worked hard to popularize wintering in the mountain resort and was worried customers would stop coming due to boredom. He also did not want to make enemies in the town from locals injured by bobsleds. He opened the world's first natural ice half-pipe track in the late 1870s.\\r\\nFormal competitions started down the natural ice Cresta Run in 1884, which was built in an annual partnership between guests and local people. The run, which is still in operation as of 2014[update], has served as a host track for skeleton at two Winter Olympics (1928 and 1948). As one of the few natural weather tracks in the world, it does not use artificial refrigeration. It is not known how much the original track evolved in the early years as the three sports matured and stabilized. The first club formed in 1897, and the first purpose-built track solely for bobsleds opened in 1902 outside St Moritz. Over the years, bobsleigh tracks evolved from straight runs to twisting and turning tracks. The original wooden sleds[2] gave way to streamlined fiberglass and metal ones.\\r\\nThe International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (FIBT) was founded in 1923. Men's four-man bobsleigh appeared in the first ever Winter Olympic Games in 1924, and the men's two-man bobsleigh event was added in 1932. Though not included in the 1960 Winter Olympics, bobsleigh has featured in every Winter Olympics since. Women's bobsleigh competition began in the US in 1983 with two demonstration races in Lake Placid, New York, one held in February and the second held during the World Cup races in March 1983. Women's two-woman bobsleigh made its Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Bobsleigh is also contested at American, European, and World Cup championships.\\r\\nGermany and Switzerland have proven the most successful bobsleighing nations measured by overall success in European, World, World Cup, and Olympic championships. Since the 1990s Germans have dominated in international competition, having won more medals than any other nation. Italy, Austria, United States and Canada also have strong bobsleigh traditions.\\r\\nBobsleighs can attain speeds of 150?km/h (93?mph), with the reported world record being 201?km/h (125?mph).[3]\\r\\nModern tracks are made of concrete, coated with ice. They are required to have at least one straight section and one labyrinth (three turns in quick succession without a straight section). Ideally, a modern track should be 1,200?to 1,300 metres (3,900ÿ4,300?ft) long and have at least fifteen curves. Speeds may exceed 120 kilometres per hour (75?mph), and some curves can subject the crews to as much as 5 g.\\r\\nSome bobsleigh tracks are also used for luge and skeleton competition.\\r\\nSome tracks offer tourists rides in bobsleighs, including those at Sigulda, Latvia; Innsbruck-Igls, Austria; Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Whistler, British Columbia, Canada; Lillehammer, Norway; Cesana Pariol, Italy; Lake Placid, US; Salt Lake City, Utah, US and La Plagne, France.\\r\\nModern day sleighs combine light metals, steel runners, and an aerodynamic composite body. Competition sleighs must be a maximum of 3.80 metres (12.5?ft) long (4-crew) or 2.70 metres (8.9?ft) long (2-crew). The runners on both are set at 0.67 metres (2.2?ft) gauge. Until the weight-limit rule was added in 1952, bobsleigh crews tended to be very heavy to ensure the greatest possible speed. Nowadays, the maximum weight, including crew, is 630 kilograms (1,390?lb) (4-man), 390 kilograms (860?lb) (2-man), or 340 kilograms (750?lb) (2-woman), which can be reached via the addition of metal weights. The bobsleighs themselves are designed to be as light as possible to allow dynamic positioning of mass through the turns of the bobsleigh course.[4]\\r\\nAlthough Bobsleigh crews once consisted of five or six people, they were reduced to two- and four-person sleighs in the 1930s. The crew has a pilot, a brakeman, and pushers. Athletes are selected based on their speed and strength, which are necessary to push the sleigh to a competitive speed at the start of the race. Pilots must have the skill, timing, and finesse to steer the sleigh along the path, or, 'line', that will produce the greatest speed.\\r\\nIn modern bobsleighs, the steering system consists of two metal rings that actuate a pulley system located in the forward cowling that turns the front runners. For example, to turn left, the pilot would pull the left ring. Only subtle steering adjustments are necessary to guide the sled; at speeds up to 80 miles per hour (130?km/h), anything larger would result in a crash. The pilot does most of the steering, and the brakeman stops the sled after crossing the finish line by pulling the sled's brake lever.\\r\\nWomen compete in women's bobsleigh (which is always two-woman), and men in both two and four-man competitions.[5] Women were confirmed as being able to compete in any four-'man' bobsleigh event, as from 25 September 2014, either as part of a mixed-sex team or an all-female team.\\r\\nIndividual runs down the course, or \\"heats\\", begin from a standing start, with the crew pushing the sled for up to 50 metres (160?ft) before boarding; though the pilot does not steer, grooves in the ice make steering unnecessary until the sled leaves the starting area. While poor form during the initial push can lose a team the heat, it is otherwise rarely, if ever, decisive. Over the rest of the course, a sleigh's speed depends on its weight, aerodynamics, runners, the condition of the ice, and the skill of the pilot.\\r\\nRace times are recorded in hundredths of seconds, so even seemingly minor errors ÿ especially those at the beginning, which affect the remainder of the heat ÿ can have a measurable impact on the final race standings.\\r\\nThe men's and women's standings for normal races are calculated over the aggregate of two runs or heats.

United Kingdom law requires certain steps be taken to ensure that a pint of beer is indeed a pint. Though this can be achieved using \\"metered dispense\\" (calibrated pumps), the more common solution is to use certified one-pint glasses.[citation needed] Until recently these had a crown stamp indicating that the certification had been done by an agency of the Crown. The number etched upon the glasses stands for the manufacturing company or site. Most pint glasses used in the United Kingdom today have actually been produced in France.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the EU Measuring Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/22/EC), the certification of measuring instruments and devices used in trade (including beer mugs, weighbridges, petrol pumps and the like) can be done by third parties anywhere within the EU with governments taking \\"only the legislative and enforcement (market surveillance) functions\\" and \\"ensuring that the system of third party assessment ... has sufficient technical competence and independence\\"[8] (or, in simple language, calibration services were privatised). Glasses that have been certified by authorised firms anywhere within the EU have the letters CE etched on with the certifying agency's identification number.[9][10]\\r\\nConservatives campaigning  to have dual markings of crown and CE were informed by EU Commissioner Gnter Verheugen that \\"a Crown stamp look-alike could naturally be affixed to the glass, as long as it is done in such a way that it is not confused with the CE marking\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSelling beer in unmeasured glasses without using some other form of calibrated measure is illegal. Half-pint, one-third pint and two-thirds pint (schooners) glasses are also available, and are subject to the same laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the glass must be accurately-calibrated, industry guidelines only require a pint to be at least 95% liquid, allowing 5% of the pint to consist of the foamy 'head'.[12][13]  The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has described this practice as selling a short measure, and says that it costs drinkers S1m a day in beer they have paid for but not received.  The British Beer and Pub Association has issued guidelines for bar staff to give a 'top up' to any drinker who is unsatisfied with the measure they receive.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nCAMRA recommends the use of \\"lined\\" or \\"oversized\\" glasses in pubs. These have a line near the top (usually labelled \\"pint to line\\") to which the beer should be poured, with the head forming above it. In the past a number of breweries supplied these glasses to their pubs; this is now rarely the case and lined glasses are found mostly at enthusiasts' events such as beer festivals, serious cask ale pubs, and breweries' own bars.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeer in Australia is formally measured in metric units, but draught beer is commonly ordered and sold in glasses approximating imperial measures, including a 570?ml pint. (In the state of South Australia, \\"pint\\" refers to a 425?ml (? pint) glass, known as a schooner in the rest of Australia.) As in the UK, certified glassware must be used; the capacity of the beer glass is defined by either the brim or, where present, the capacity line.[15] There are no legally prescribed sizes for beer volumes, but the stated capacities, which are a legal requirement, must be formally tested by the hotelliers and breweries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, Federal law mandates a standard imperial pint.[16] However, this law is rarely enforced, and establishments typically sell US pints or other measures as \\"pints.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Republic of Ireland uses the imperial 20 fl oz pint measure (568 ml)[18], where legal metrology marks are used to show that a glass has passed inspection by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, a state-run body which enforces a number of standard rulings. Starting in 2006, the NSAI \\"pint\\" mark, a circle featuring two wavy lines, between which \\"PINT\\" is written, with a year mark (last two digits), and a three digit batch code either side; has begun to be phased out with a European standard \\"PINT\\"/CE logo stamp[citation needed]. Smaller Pint glasses have been used in pubs and nightclubs though.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Israel, although officially defined as 568ml,[19] pubs use the term rather arbitrarily and the \\"pints\\" served constitute a wide range of volumes (360mlÿ440ml). In the past, the custom was to serve beer in 330ml or 500ml in the original beer manufacture's glass. After the reform in the alcohol taxes in July 2012 the tax rate doubled.[20] Each liter of beer is charged with 4.2nis tax. In order to avoid raising prices at the pubs, and as a result, the loss of customers, a new \\"magic\\" appeared, called \\"pint\\".[21] The customers don't really know the vague term of a pint,[22] and it varies from place to place. Some of the places didn't even change the menu, and it's served as 500 ml.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, a pint is 16 US fluid ounces (473 mL). However, the typical conical \\"pint\\" glass holds 16 oz. to its rim. With a half inch of foam, the actual liquid fill is roughly 14 oz.  Recently (as of 2008), some restaurants have replaced 16-ounce pint glasses (473 mL) with 14 ouncers (415 mL) to which customers have objected.[23] In response to this, legislation has been introduced in the state of Michigan (known for its craft brewing culture) to require bars to serve 16-ounce pints.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is increasingly common to find pint glasses which contain markings on the base; very often these glasses are branded to one particular beer. The markings themselves are formed from small pits which aid in nucleation, allowing the gas within it to be released more easily, thus preserving the head. Without the aid of these pits a regular pint glass will keep a head for only 3 or 4 minutes before appearing 'flat'.[25] The markings come in a variety of styles ranging from a simple circular or square hatched pattern to more complicated branding messages.\\r\\n\\r\\nPint glass collecting is an increasingly popular way for individuals to commemorate their visits to popular tourist destinations, most notably to microbreweries or sports arenas. These destinations often sell pint glasses adorned with their logos, which are either screen-printed or engraved on the side of the glass. Brewery enthusiasts may travel thousands of miles to see where their favorite beer is made or to sample new local and fresh beers, and collectors often display their collections (which sometimes total in the hundreds) in display cases or on shelves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeer festivals frequently have commemorative pint glasses made specially for the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with other glass objects such as glass bottles, pint glasses can be used as a weapon, either smashing an intact glass in a victim's face or smashing the glass and then slashing with the shards. Such attacks, called \\"glassing\\", are a significant problem in the United Kingdom, with more than 87,000 glassing attacks per year,[26] resulting in over 5,000 injuries.[27] This has led to less-dangerous alternatives being used, either plastic glasses and bottles at large events or violence-prone venues, or treated glass, primarily tempered glass, which has been used in Australia.[28]","input":"How many ml in a pint glass uk?"},{"output":"Brazil","context":"The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion is Germany, which won its fourth title at the 2014 tournament in Brazil.\\r\\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the World Cup Finals. 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\\r\\nThe 20 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight different national teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England, France and Spain, with one title each.\\r\\nThe World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.[1][2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England,[5] which ended in a 0ÿ0 draw. The first international tournament, the inaugural edition of the British Home Championship, took place in 1884.[6] As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the turn of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics (however, the IOC has retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games.[7]\\r\\nAfter FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.[8]\\r\\nAt the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football became an official competition. Planned by The Football Association (FA), England's football governing body, the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the England national amateur football team) won the gold medals. They repeated the feat in 1912 in Stockholm.\\r\\nWith the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, Sir Thomas Lipton organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as The First World Cup,[9] and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from County Durham, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.\\r\\nIn 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a \\"world football championship for amateurs\\", and took responsibility for managing the event.[10] This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, contested by Egypt and 13 European teams, and won by Belgium.[11] Uruguay won the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928. Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era.\\r\\nDue to the success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with President Jules Rimet as the driving force, again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship itself.[12] With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country of the inaugural World Cup tournament.\\r\\nThe national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.\\r\\nThe first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 July 1930, and were won by France and the USA, who defeated Mexico 4ÿ1 and Belgium 3ÿ0 respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France.[13] In the final, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4ÿ2 in front of a crowd of 93,000 people in Montevideo, and in doing so became the first nation to win the World Cup.[14]\\r\\nAfter the creation of the World Cup, FIFA and the IOC disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the 1932 Summer Olympics.[15] Olympic football returned at the 1936 Summer Olympics, but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious World Cup.\\r\\nThe issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 and 1938 tournaments, with Brazil the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions, which Nazi Germany and Brazil sought to host,[16] were cancelled due to World War II and its aftermath.\\r\\nThe 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was the first to include British participants. British teams withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football,[17] but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation.[18] The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation Brazil, in the match called \\"Maracanazo\\" (Portuguese: Maracana?o).\\r\\nIn the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams competed in each tournament, except in 1938, when Austria was absorbed into Germany after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when India, Scotland, and Turkey withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams.[19] Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: USA, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970.\\r\\nThe tournament was expanded to 24 teams in 1982,[20] and then to 32 in 1998,[21] also allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; South Korea, finishing in fourth place in 2002; Senegal, along with USA, both quarter-finalists in 2002; Ghana, quarter-finalists in 2010; and Costa Rica, quarter-finalists in 2014. Nevertheless, European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, and 2006 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far.\\r\\nTwo hundred teams entered the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification rounds; 198 nations attempted to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, while a record 204 countries entered qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[22]\\r\\nIn October 2013, Sepp Blatter spoke of guaranteeing the Caribbean Football Union's region a position in the World Cup.[23] In the 25 October 2013 edition of the FIFA Weekly Blatter wrote that: \\"From a purely sporting perspective, I would like to see globalisation finally taken seriously, and the African and Asian national associations accorded the status they deserve at the FIFA World Cup. It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup.\\"[24] Those two remarks suggested to commentators that Blatter could be putting himself forward for re-election to the FIFA Presidency.[25]\\r\\nFollowing the magazine's publication, Blatter's would-be opponent for the FIFA Presidency, UEFA President Michel Platini responded that he intended to extend the World Cup to 40 national associations, increasing the number of participants by eight. Platini said that he would allocate an additional berth to UEFA, two to Asia Football Confederation and Confederation of African Football, two shared between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL, and a guaranteed place for the Oceania Football Confederation.[26] Platini was clear about why he wanted to expand the World Cup. He said: \\"[The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup?... but it's a good compromise.?... It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve.\\"[26]\\r\\nIn October 2016 FIFA president Gianni Infantino stated his support for a 48-team World Cup in 2026.[27] On 10 January 2017, FIFA confirmed the 2026 World Cup will have 48 finalist teams.[28]\\r\\nBy May 2015, the games were under a particularly dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games,[29] with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Justice Department announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on May 29 and December 3.[30] By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.[31]\\r\\nOn 4 June 2015 Chuck Blazer while co-operating with the FBI and the Swiss authorities admitted that he and the other members of FIFA's then-executive committee were bribed in order to promote the 1998 and 2010 World Cups.[32] On 10 June 2015 Swiss authorities seized computer data from the offices of Sepp Blatter.[33] The same day, FIFA postponed the bidding process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in light of the allegations surrounding bribery in the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. Then-secretary general Jr?me Valcke stated, \\"Due to the situation, I think it's nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being.\\"[34] On 28 October 2015, Blatter and FIFA VP Michel Platini, a potential candidate for presidency, were suspended for 90 days; both maintained their innocence in statements made to the news media.[35]\\r\\nOn 3 December 2015 two FIFA vice-presidents were arrested on suspicion of bribery in the same Zurich hotel where seven FIFA officials had been arrested in May.[36] An additional 16 indictments by the U.S. Department of Justice were announced on the same day.[37]\\r\\nAn equivalent tournament for women's football, the FIFA Women's World Cup, was first held in 1991 in China.[38] The women's tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the men's, but is growing; the number of entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120, more than double that of 1991.[39]\\r\\nMen's football has been included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932. Unlike many other sports, the men's football tournament at the Olympics is not a top-level tournament, and since 1992, an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three over-age players.[40] Women's football made its Olympic debut in 1996.\\r\\nThe FIFA Confederations Cup is a tournament held one year before the World Cup at the World Cup host nation(s) as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming World Cup. It is contested by the winners of each of the six FIFA confederation championships, along with the FIFA World Cup champion and the host country.[41]\\r\\nFIFA also organises international tournaments for youth football (FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup), club football (FIFA Club World Cup), and football variants such as futsal (FIFA Futsal World Cup) and beach soccer (FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup). The latter three do not have a women's version, although a FIFA Women's Club World Cup has been proposed.[42]\\r\\nThe FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup is held the year before each Women's World Cup and both tournaments are awarded in a single bidding process. The U-20 tournament serves as a dress rehearsal for the larger competition.[43]\\r\\nFrom 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy was awarded to the World Cup winning team. It was originally simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.[44]\\r\\nAfter 1970, a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is 36?cm (14.2?in) high, made of solid 18 carat (75%) gold and weighs 6.175?kg (13.6?lb). The base contains two layers of semi-precious malachite while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since 1974. The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: \\"The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory.\\"[45]\\r\\nThis new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy only until the post-match celebration is finished. They are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original immediately afterwards.[46]\\r\\nCurrently, all members (players, coaches, and managers) of the top three teams receive medals with an insignia of the World Cup Trophy; winners' (gold), runners-up' (silver), and third-place (bronze). In the 2002 edition, fourth-place medals were awarded to hosts South Korea. Before the 1978 tournament, medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch at the end of the final and the third-place match. In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.[47][48][49]\\r\\nSince the second World Cup in 1934, qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament.[50] They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, and Europe), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams.\\r\\nThe qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup.[51] From the 1938 World Cup onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward, requiring the champions to qualify. Brazil, winners in 2002, were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.[52]\\r\\nThe current final tournament has been used since 1998 and features 32 national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: the group stage followed by the knockout stage.[53]\\r\\nIn the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the FIFA World Rankings and/or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups.[54] The other teams are assigned to different \\"pots\\", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since 1998, constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.[55]\\r\\nEach group plays a round-robin tournament, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. This means that a total of six matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams.[56] The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).\\r\\nIf one considers all possible outcomes (win, draw, loss) for all six matches in a group, there are 729 (= 36) different outcome combinations possible. However, a certain number (207) of these combinations lead to ties between the second and third places. In such case, the ranking among these teams is determined as follows:[57]\\r\\nThe knockout stage is a single-elimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.[53]\\r\\nOn 10 January 2017, FIFA approved a new format, the 48-team World Cup (to accommodate more teams), which consists of 16 groups of three teams each, with two teams qualifying from each group, to form a round of 32 knockout stage, to be implemented by 2026.[58]\\r\\nEarly World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing.[59] The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.[60]\\r\\nSince the 1958 FIFA World Cup, to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the only tournament with multiple hosts.[61] South Africa became the first African nation to host the World Cup in 2010. The 2014 FIFA World Cup was hosted by Brazil, the first held in South America since Argentina 1978,[62] and was the first occasion where consecutive World Cups were held outside Europe.\\r\\nThe host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Council. This is done under an exhaustive ballot system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a \\"Hosting Agreement\\" from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the World Cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament. However, there have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time, as was the case for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar, with Qatar becoming the first Middle Eastern country to host the tournament.[63][64]\\r\\nFor the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament is rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018.[65] This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.\\r\\nSix of the eight champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exceptions being Brazil, who finished as runners-up after losing the deciding match on home soil in 1950 and lost their semifinal against Germany in 2014, and Spain, which reached the second round on home soil in 1982. England (1966) and France (1998) won their only titles while playing as host nations. Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934) and Argentina (1978) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while Germany (1974) won their second title on home soil.\\r\\nOther nations have also been successful when hosting the tournament. Switzerland (quarter-finals 1954), Sweden (runners-up in 1958), Chile (third place in 1962), South Korea (fourth place in 2002), and Mexico (quarter-finals in 1970 and 1986) all have their best results when serving as hosts. So far, South Africa (2010) has been the only host nation to fail to advance beyond the first round.\\r\\nThe World Cup was first televised in 1954 and is now the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29 billion.[1] 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of this tournament (a ninth of the entire population of the planet). The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into groups, was watched by 300 million viewers.[67] The World Cup attracts many sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event. It was predicted that Brazil will bring in more than $11 billion in revenue for the 2014 World Cup.\\r\\nEach FIFA World Cup since 1966 has its own mascot or logo. World Cup Willie, the mascot for the 1966 competition, was the first World Cup mascot.[68] Recent World Cups have also featured official match balls specially designed for each World Cup.\\r\\nThe World Cup even has a statistically significant effect on birth rates, the male/female sex ratio of newborns, and heart attacks in nations whose national teams are competing.[69][70][71] Hosting the World Cup or a home team's win tends to increase male births and total birth rate, and heart attacks are more common when home teams are on the field.\\r\\n[note 2]\\r\\n[note 4]\\r\\nIn all, 77 nations have played in at least one World Cup.[75] Of these, eight national teams have won the World Cup, and they have added stars to their badges, with each star representing a World Cup victory. (Uruguay, however, choose to display four stars on their badge, representing their two gold medals at the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics and their two World Cup titles in 1930 and 1950).\\r\\nWith five titles, Brazil are the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have played in every World Cup (20) to date.[76] Brazil were also the first team to win the World Cup for the third (1970), fourth (1994) and fifth (2002) time. Italy (1934 and 1938) and Brazil (1958 and 1962) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles. West Germany (1982ÿ1990) and Brazil (1994ÿ2002) are the only nations to appear in three consecutive World Cup finals. Germany has made the most top-four finishes (13), medals (12), as well as the most finals (8).\\r\\nTo date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by teams from the UEFA (Europe) and CONMEBOL (South America) confederations. European nations have won eleven titles, while South American have won nine. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: USA (North, Central America and Caribbean) in 1930 and South Korea (Asia) in 2002. The best result of an African team is reaching the quarter-finals: Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010. Only one Oceanian qualifier, Australia in 2006, has advanced to the second round.[77]\\r\\nBrazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the only teams to win a World Cup outside their continental confederation; Brazil came out victorious in Europe (1958), North America (1970 and 1994) and Asia (2002), Argentina won a World Cup in North America in 1986, while Spain won a World Cup in Africa in 2010. Germany was the first European team to win in South America in 2014. Only on four occasions have consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent, and currently it is the first time with three champions in a row from the same continental confederation. Italy and Brazil successfully defended their titles in 1938 and 1962 respectively, while Italy's triumph in 2006 has been followed by Spain's in 2010 and Germany's in 2014. Currently, it is also the first time that one of the currently winning continents (Europe) is ahead of the other (South America) by two championships.\\r\\nAt the end of each World Cup, awards are presented to the players and teams for accomplishments other than their final team positions in the tournament. There are currently six awards:[79]\\r\\nAn All-Star Team consisting of the best players of the tournament has also been announced for each tournament since 1998.\\r\\nTwo players share the record for playing in the most World Cups; Mexico's Antonio Carbajal (1950ÿ1966) and Germany's Lothar Matth?us (1982ÿ1998) both played in five tournaments.[84] Matth?us has played the most World Cup matches overall, with 25 appearances.[85] Brazil's Djalma Santos (1954ÿ1962), West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer (1966ÿ1974) and Germany's Philipp Lahm (2006ÿ2014) are the only players to be named to three Finals All-Star Teams.[86]\\r\\nMiroslav Klose of Germany (2002ÿ2014) is the all-time top scorer at the finals, with 16 goals. He broke Ronaldo of Brazil's record of 15 goals (1998ÿ2006) during 2014 semi-final match against Brazil. West Germany's Gerd Mller (1970ÿ1974) is third, with 14 goals.[87] The fourth placed goalscorer, France's Just Fontaine, holds the record for the most goals scored in a single World Cup; all his 13 goals were scored in the 1958 tournament.[88]\\r\\nIn November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.[47] This made Brazil's Pel the only player to have won three World Cup winners' medals (1958, 1962, and 1970, although he did not play in the 1962 final due to injury),[89] with 20 other players who have won two winners' medals. Seven players have collected all three types of World Cup medals (winners', runner- ups', and third-place); five players were from West Germany's squad of 1966ÿ1974 including Franz Beckenbauer, Jrgen Grabowski, Horst-Dieter H?ttges, Sepp Maier and Wolfgang Overath (1966ÿ1974), Italy's Franco Baresi (1982, 1990, 1994) and the most recent has been Miroslav Klose of Germany (2002ÿ2014) with four consecutive medals.\\r\\nBrazil's Mrio Zagallo and West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer are the only people to date to win the World Cup as both player and head coach. Zagallo won in 1958 and 1962 as a player and in 1970 as head coach.[90] Beckenbauer won in 1974 as captain and in 1990 as head coach.[91] Italy's Vittorio Pozzo is the only head coach to ever win two World Cups (1934 and 1938).[92] All World Cup winning head coaches were natives of the country they coached to victory.\\r\\nAmong the national teams, Germany has played the most World Cup matches (106) and appeared in the most finals (8), semi-finals (13), quarter-finals (16) as well as scoring the most World Cup goals (224), while Brazil has appeared in the most World Cups (20).[93] The two teams have played each other twice in the World Cup, in the 2002 final and in the 2014 semi-final.","input":"How many times brazil won the world cup football championship?"},{"output":"William Harvey","context":"William Harvey (1 April 1578 ÿ 3 June 1657)[2] was an English physician who made seminal contributions in anatomy and physiology. He was the first known physician to describe completely and in detail the systemic circulation and properties of blood being pumped to the brain and body by the heart, though earlier writers, such as Realdo Colombo, Michael Servetus, and Jacques Dubois, had provided precursors of the theory.[3][4] In 1973 the William Harvey Hospital was constructed in the town of Ashford, a few miles from his birthplace of Folkestone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam's father, Thomas Harvey, was a jurat of Folkestone where he served the office of mayor in 1600. Records and personal descriptions delineate him as an overall calm, diligent, and intelligent man whose \\"sons... revered, consulted and implicitly trusted in him... (they) made their father the treasurer of their wealth when they acquired great estates...(He) kept, employed, and improved their gainings to their great advantage.\\"[5] Thomas Harvey's portrait can still be seen in the central panel of a wall of the dining-room at Rolls Park, Chigwell, in Essex. William was the eldest of nine children, seven sons and two daughters, of Thomas and his wife Joan Halke. Notable family connections include Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, who married William's niece Elizabeth Harvey, and the diplomat Sir Daniel Harvey.[citation needed]\\r\\nHarvey's initial education was carried out in Folkestone, where he learned Latin. He then entered the King's School (Canterbury). Harvey stayed at the King's School for five years, after which he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge in 1593.\\r\\nHarvey graduated as a Bachelor of Arts from Caius in 1597.[6] He then travelled through France and Germany to Italy, where he entered the University of Padua, in 1599.\\r\\nDuring Harvey's years of study there, he developed a relationship with Fabricius and read Fabricius's De Venarum Ostiolis.\\r\\nHarvey graduated as a Doctor of Medicine at the age of 24 from the University of Padua on 25 April 1602. It reports that Harvey had\\r\\n\\"conducted himself so wonderfully well in the examination and had shown such skill, memory and learning that he had far surpassed even the great hopes which his examiners had formed of him.\\"[7]\\r\\nAfter graduating from Padua, Harvey immediately returned to England where he obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine from the University of Cambridge that same year, and became a fellow of Gonville and Caius College. Following this, Harvey established himself in London, joining the Royal College of Physicians on 5 October 1604.\\r\\nA few weeks after his admission, Harvey married Elizabeth Browne, \\"daughter of Lancelot Browne Dr. Physic\\".[8] They had no children.\\r\\nHarvey was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 5 June 1607, which earned him the Post-nominal letters FRCP, and he then accepted a position at St Bartholomew's Hospital that he was to occupy for almost all the rest of his life. Succeeding a Dr Wilkinson on 14 October 1609, he became the Physician in charge at St?Bartholomew's Hospital, which enjoined him, \\"in God's most holy name\\" to \\"endeavor yourself to do the best of your knowledge in the profession of physic to the poor then present, or any other of the poor at any time of the week which shall be sent home unto you by the Hospitaller... You shall not, for favor, lucre or gain, appoint or write anything for the poor but such good and wholesome things as you shall think with your best advice will do the poor good, without any affection or respect to be had to the apothecary. And you shall take no gift or reward... for your counsel... This you will promise to do as you shall answer before God... \\"[9]\\r\\nHarvey earned around thirty-three pounds a year and lived in a small house in Ludgate, although two houses in West Smithfield were attached as fringe benefits to the post of Physician. At this point, the physician's function consisted of a simple but thorough analysis of patients who were brought to the hospital once a week and the consequent writing of prescriptions.\\r\\nThe next important phase of Harvey's life began with his appointment to the office of Lumleian lecturer on 4 August 1615. The Lumleian lectureship, founded by Lord Lumley and a Dr. Richard Caldwell in 1582, consisted in pronouncing lectures for a period of seven years, with the purpose of \\"spreading light\\" and increasing the general knowledge of anatomy throughout England.\\r\\nHarvey began his lectures in April 1616. At this time, at the age of thirty-seven, he was described as \\"a man of lowest stature, round faced; his eyes small, round, very black and full of spirit; his hair as black as a raven and curling\\".[10] The notes which he used at the time are preserved in the British Museum.\\r\\nAt the beginning of his lectures, Harvey laid down the canons for his guidance:\\r\\nHarvey continued to participate in the Lumleian lectures while also taking care of his patients at St Bartholomew's Hospital; he thus soon attained an important and fairly lucrative practice, which climaxed with his appointment as 'Physician Extraordinary' to King James I on 3 February 1618. He seems to have similarly served various aristocrats, including Lord Chancellor Bacon.[12][13] Bacon entirely failed to impress the more practical minded Harvey, who refused to regard him as a great philosopher. He said of him \\"He writes philosophy like a Lord Chancellor.\\"[14]\\r\\nIn 1628 he published in Frankfurt his completed treatise on the circulation of the blood, the De Motu Cordis. As a result of negative comments by other physicians Harvey \\"fell mightily in his practice\\",[15] but continued advancing his career. He was re-elected 'Censor' of the College of Physicians in 1629, having been elected for the first time in 1613 and the second time in 1625. Eventually, Harvey was also elected Treasurer of the College.\\r\\nHarvey was a prominent sceptic regarding allegations of witchcraft. He was one of the examiners of four women from Lancashire accused of witchcraft in 1634, and as a consequence of his report, all of them were acquitted.[16][17] Earlier, in 1632, while travelling with the King to Newmarket, he had been sent to investigate a woman accused of being a witch. Initially he told her that he was a wizard and had come to discuss the Craft with her, and asked whether she had a familiar. She put down a saucer of milk and called to a toad which came out and drank the milk. He then sent her out to fetch some ale, and killed the toad and dissected it, concluding that it was a perfectly ordinary animal and not supernatural in any way. When the woman returned she was naturally very angry and upset, but Harvey eventually silenced her by stating that he was the King's Physician, sent to discover whether she were a witch, and if she were, to have her apprehended.[18]\\r\\nAt the age of fifty-two, Harvey received commands by the king to accompany the Duke of Lennox during his trip abroad. This voyage ÿ the first after his return from Padua ÿ lasted three years, taking Harvey through the countries of France and Spain during the Mantuan War and Plague. During this journey he wrote to Viscount Dorchester:\\r\\n\\"I can complain that by the way we could scarce see a dog, crow, kite, raven or any other bird, or anything to anatomize, only some few miserable people, the relics of the war and the plague where famine had made anatomies before I came. It is scarce credible in so rich, populous, and plentiful countries as these were that so much misery and desolation, poverty and famine should in so short a time be, as we have seen. I interpret it well that it will be a great motive for all here to have and procure assurance of settled peace. It is time to leave fighting when there is nothing to eat, nothing to be kept, and nothing to be gotten\\".[19]\\r\\nHaving returned to England in 1632, Harvey accompanied King Charles I wherever he went as 'Physician in Ordinary'. In particular, Charles's hunting expeditions gave Harvey access to many deer carcasses; it was upon them that Harvey made many observations and consequent theories. Harvey returned to Italy in 1636, dining at the English College, Rome, as a guest of the Jesuits there, in October 1636. It is possible he met Galileo in Florence en route.[20]\\r\\nDuring the English Civil War a mob of citizen-soldiers against the King entered Harvey's lodgings, stole his goods, and scattered his papers. The papers consisted of \\"the records of a large number of dissections ... of diseased bodies, with this observations on the development on insects, and a series of notes on comparative anatomy.\\"[21] During this period, Harvey maintained his position, helped the wounded on several occasions and protected the King's children during the Battle of Edgehill.\\r\\nThe conflicts of the Civil War soon led King Charles to Oxford, with Harvey attending, where the physician was made \\"Doctor of Physic\\" in 1642 and later Warden of Merton College in 1645. \\"In Oxford he (Harvey) very soon settled down to his accustomed pursuits, unmindful of the clatter of arms and of the constant marching and countermarching around him, for the city remained the base of operations until its surrender... \\"[22]\\r\\nThe surrender of Oxford in 1645 marks the beginning of Harvey's gradual retirement from public life and duties. Now sixty-eight years old and childless, Harvey had lost three brothers and his wife by this time. He thus decided to return to London, and lived with his brothers Eliab and Daniel at different periods. Having retired from St Bartholomew's Hospital and his various other aforementioned positions, he passed most of this time reading general literature. Several attempts to bring Harvey back into the 'working world' were made, however; here is an excerpt of one of Harvey's answers:\\r\\n\\"Would you be the man who should recommend me to quit the peaceful haven where I now pass my life and launch again upon the faithless sea? You know full well what a storm my former lucubrations raised. Much better is it oftentimes to grow wise at home and in private, than by publishing what you have amassed with infinite labour, to stir up tempests that may rob you of peace and quiet for the rest of your days.\\"[23]\\r\\nHarvey died at Roehampton in the house of his brother Eliab on 3 June 1657. Descriptions of the event seem to show that he died of a cerebral hemorrhage from vessels long injured by gout: it is highly probable that the left middle cerebral artery malfunctioned, leading to a gradual accumulation of blood to the brain which eventually overwhelmed it. There exists a fairly detailed account of what happened on that day; according to the information at hand, Harvey:\\r\\n\\"went to speak and found that he had the dead palsy in his tongue; then he saw what was to become of him. He knew there were then no hopes of his recovery, so presently he sends for his young nephews to come up to him. He then made signs (for seized with the dead palsy in his tongue he could not speak) to let him blood his tongue, which did him little or no good, and so ended his days, dying in the evening of the day on which he was stricken, the palsy giving him an easy passport.\\"[24]\\r\\nHis will distributed his material goods and wealth throughout his extended family and also left a substantial amount of money to the Royal College of Physicians.\\r\\nHarvey was buried in Hempstead, Essex. The funeral procession started on 26 June 1657, leading Harvey to be placed in the 'Harvey Chapel' built by Eliab. The conditions of Harvey's burial are also known: \\"Harvey was laid in the chapel between the bodies of his two nieces, and like them he was lapt in lead, coffin less\\".[25] On St. Luke's Day, 18 October 1883, Harvey's remains were reinterred, the leaden case carried from the vault by eight Fellows of the College of Physicians, and deposited in a sarcophagus containing his works and an inscription:\\r\\n\\"The body of William Harvey lapt in lead, simply soldered, was laid without shell or enclosure of any kind in the Harvey vault of this Church of Hempstead, Essex, in June 1657. In the course of time the lead enclosing the remains was, from expose and natural decay, so seriously damaged as to endanger its preservation, rendering some repair of it the duty of those interested in the memory of the illustrious discoverer of the circulation of the Blood. The Royal College of Physicians, of which corporate body Harvey was a munificent Benefactor did in the years 1882ÿ1883, by permission of the Representatives of the Harvey family, undertake this duty. In accordance with this determination the leaden mortuary chest containing the remains of Harvey was repaired, and was, as far as possible, restored to its original state... \\"[26]\\r\\nPublished in 1628 in the city of Frankfurt (host to an annual book fair that Harvey knew would allow immediate dispersion of his work), the 72 page Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus contains the matured account of the circulation of the blood. Opening with a dedication to King Charles I, the quarto has 17 chapters which give a clear and connected account of the action of the heart and the consequent movement of the blood around the body in a circuit. Having only a tiny lens at his disposal, Harvey was not able to reach the adequate pictures that were attained through such microscopes used by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek; thus he had to resort to theory ÿ and not practical evidence ÿ in certain parts of his book. After the first chapter, which simply outlines past ideas and accepted rules regarding the heart and lungs, Harvey moves on to a fundamental premise to his treatise, stating that it was important to study the heart when it was active in order to truly comprehend its true movement; a task which even he found of great difficulty, as he says:\\r\\n\\"...I found the task so truly arduous... that I was almost tempted to think... that the movement of the heart was only to be comprehended by God. For I could neither rightly perceive at first when the systole and when the diastole took place by reason of the rapidity of the movement...\\"[27]\\r\\nThis initial thought led Harvey's ambition and assiduousness to a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart (studied with less hindrances in cold-blooded animals). After this, Harvey goes on to an analysis of the arteries, showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the left ventricle, while the contraction of the right ventricle propels its charge of blood into the pulmonary artery. Whilst doing this, the physician reiterates the fact that these two ventricles move together almost simultaneously and not independently as had been thought previously by his predecessors. This discovery was made while observing the heart of such animals as the eel and several other types of fish; indeed, the general study of countless animals was of utmost importance to the physician: among the ones already cited, one can add the study of the snail, the invisible shrimp, the chick before its hatching and even the pigeon. A digression to an experiment can be made to this note: using the inactive heart of a dead pigeon and placing upon it a finger wet with saliva, Harvey was able to witness a transitory and yet incontrovertible pulsation. He had just witnessed the heart's ability to recover from fatigue.\\r\\nAs early as the 17th century, William Harvey had already discerned the existence of the Ductus Arteriosus and explained its relative function. Here he says, \\"...in embryos, whilst the lungs are in a state of inaction, performing no function, subject to no movement any more than if they had not been present, Nature uses the two ventricles of the heart as if they formed but one for the transmission of the blood.\\"[28] However, the apex of Harvey's work is probably the eighth chapter, in which he deals with the actual quantity of blood passing through the heart from the veins to the arteries. Coming into conflict with Galen's accepted view of the liver as the origin of venous blood, Harvey estimated the capacity of the heart, how much blood is expelled through each pump of the heart, and the number of times the heart beats in a half an hour. All of these estimates were purposefully low, so that people could see the vast amount of blood Galen's theory required the liver to produce. He estimated that the capacity of the heart was 1.5 imperial fluid ounces (43?ml), and that every time the heart pumps, ?1?8 of that blood is expelled. This led to Harvey's estimate that about 1?6 imperial fluid ounce (4.7?ml) of blood went through the heart every time it pumped. The next estimate he used was that the heart beats 1,000 times every half an hour, which gave 10 pounds 6 ounces of blood in a half an hour, and when this number was multiplied by 48 half hours in a day he realized that the liver would have to produce 498 pounds of blood in a day, more than the weight of the whole body.\\r\\nHaving this simple but essential mathematical proportion at hand ÿ which proved the overall impossible aforementioned role of the liver ÿ Harvey went on to prove how the blood circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on serpents and fish: tying their veins and arteries in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the veins, the heart would become empty, while as he did the same to the arteries, the organ would swell up.\\r\\nThis process was later performed on the human body (in the image on the right): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the ligature was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood. Harvey then noticed little bumps in the veins, which he realized were the valves of the veins discovered by his teacher, Hieronymus Fabricius. Harvey tried to push blood in the vein down the arm, but to no avail. When he tried to push it up the arm, it moved quite easily. The same effect was seen in other veins of the body, except the veins in the neck. Those veins were different from the others ÿ they did not allow blood to flow up, but only down. This led Harvey to believe that the veins allowed blood to flow to the heart, and the valves maintained the one way flow.\\r\\nContrary to a popular misconception, Harvey did not predict the existence of capillaries. His observations convinced him that direct connection between veins and arteries are unnecessary; he wrote \\"blood permeates the pores\\" in the flesh and it is \\"absorbed and imbibed from every part\\" by the veins.[29]\\r\\nAt the time of Harvey's publication, Galen had been an influential medical authority for several centuries. Galen believed that blood passed between the ventricles by means of invisible pores. According to Galen's views, the venous system was quite separate from the arterial system, except when they came in contact through the unseen pores. Arabic scholar Ibn al-Nafis had disputed aspects of Galen's views, providing a model that seems to imply a form of pulmonary circulation in his Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon (1242). Al-Nafis stated that blood moved from the heart to the lungs, where it mixed with air, and then back to the heart, from which it spread to the rest of the body.[30] Harvey's discoveries inevitably and historically came into conflict with Galen's teachings and the publication of his treatise De Motu Cordis incited considerable controversy within the medical community. Some doctors affirmed they would \\"rather err with Galen than proclaim the truth with Harvey.\\"[31][32] Galen incompletely perceived the function of the heart, believing it a \\"productor of heat\\", while the function of its affluents, the arteries, was that of cooling the blood as the lungs \\"...fanned and cooled the heart itself\\".[33] Galen thought that during dilation the arteries sucked in air, while during their contraction they discharged vapours through pores in the flesh and skin.\\r\\nUntil the 17th century, two separate systems were thought to be involved in blood circulation: the natural system, containing venous blood which had its origin in the liver, and the vital system, containing arterial blood and the 'spirits' which flowed from the heart, distributing heat and life to all parts. Like bellows, the lungs fanned and cooled this vital blood.\\r\\nIndependently of Ibn Al-Nafis, Michael Servetus identified pulmonary circulation, but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the Manuscript of Paris in 1546.[34] It was later published in the theological work which caused his execution in 1553, almost all copies of which were destroyed. In: Christianismi Restitutio, Book V, the Aragonese Miguel Servet (Michel de Villeneuve, 1509?ÿ1553) wrote: 'The blood is passed through the pulmonary artery to the pulmonary vein for a lengthy pass through the lungs, during which it becomes red, and gets rid of the sooty fumes by the act of exhalation'.\\r\\nPulmonary circulation was described by Renaldus Columbus, Andrea Cesalpino and Vesalius, before Harvey would provide a refined and complete description of the circulatory system.\\r\\nHarvey's other major work was Exercitationes de generatione animalium (On Animal Generation_, published in 1651. He had been working on it for many years but might never have finished it without the encouragement of his friend George Ent.[2]\\r\\nThe book starts with a description of development of the hen's egg. The major part is theoretical, dealing with Aristotle's theories and the work of the physicians following Galen and up to Fabricius. Finally he deals with embryogenesis in viviparous animals especially hinds and does. The treatment is generally Aristotelian and limited by use of a simple magnifying lens.\\r\\nNeedham claims the following achievements for this work.[35]\\r\\nA final allusion to the rules established and followed by the physician throughout his life can be made:\\r\\nArthur Schlesinger Jr. included William Harvey in a list of \\"The Ten Most Influential People of the Second Millennium\\" in the World Almanac & Book of Facts.\\r\\nThe main lecture theatre of the School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge is named after William Harvey, who was an alumnus of the institute.\\r\\nWilliam Harvey Research Institute at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry is a research facility focussing on biochemical pharmacology, orthopaedic diseases, endocrinology, genomics, clinical pharmacology and translational medicine and therapeutics.\\r\\nHarvey's whalebone demonstration rod, tipped with silver, resides in the silver room of the museum of the Royal College of Physicians. He used it to point to objects during his lectures.[37]\\r\\nWilliam Harvey Hospital in Ashford, Kent is named after him. Harvey's hometown of Folkestone, Kent also has a statue of him.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn terms of his personality, information shows that William Harvey was seen as a \\"...humorous but extremely precise man...\\",[38] how he was often so immersed in his own thoughts that he would often suffer from insomnia (cured with a simple walk through the house), and how he was always ready for an open and direct conversation. He also loved the darkness, for it is said that it was there where \\"...he could best contemplate\\", thus sometimes hiding out in caves. A heavy drinker of coffee, Harvey would walk out combing his hair every morning full of energy and enthusiastic spirit through the fields. We have also come to understand Harvey's somewhat unorthodox method of dealing with his gout, here cited completely: \\"...his [Harvey's] cure was thus: he would sit with his legs bare...put them into a pail of water till he was almost dead with cold, then betake himself to his stove, and so 'twas gone\\".[39] Apart from the already mentioned love of literature, Harvey was also an intense and dedicated observer of birds during his free time: several long and detailed passages of citations could be written delineating his observations in such places as the \\"Pile of Boulders\\" (a small island in Lancashire) and 'Bass Rock' (island off the East Coast of Scotland).\\r\\nWilliam Harvey\\r\\nColor portrait\\r\\nWilliam Harvey, after a painting by Cornelius Jansen\\r\\nWilliam Harvey","input":"Who first described the continuous circulation of blood through the human body?"},{"output":"Jack Thorne","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is a two-part stage play written by Jack Thorne based on an original story by Thorne, J.

Rowling and John Tiffany.[1] Previews of the play began at the Palace Theatre, London on 7 June 2016,[2] and it premiered on 30 July 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe play opened on Broadway on 22 April 2018 at the Lyric Theatre, with previews starting on 16 March 2018. Its cast is similar to that of the first year on West End, with returning actors Anthony Boyle, Sam Clemmett, Noma Dumezweni, Poppy Miller, Jamie Parker, Alex Price, and  Paul Thornley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story begins nineteen years after the events of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and follows Harry Potter, now a Ministry of Magic employee, and his younger son Albus Severus Potter, who is about to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards, the London production received a record-breaking eleven nominations and an again record-breaking nine awards, including Best New Play, Best Actor, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Actress in a Supporting Role and Best Director. At the 2018 Tony Awards, the Broadway production won six awards, including Best Play.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the opening scene, set during the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in the year 2017, Harry Potter and Ginny Potter send their second son, Albus Severus Potter, on the Hogwarts Express to begin his first year at Hogwarts. Harry is now working in a desk job as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic, while Ginny is the editor of the sports section of The Daily Prophet. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger also send their daughter Rose Granger-Weasley on the train. Hermione is now Minister of Magic, while Ron manages Weasley's Wizard Wheezes in Diagon Alley. Albus makes an unlikely friendship in Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Harry's former nemesis Draco Malfoy and Astoria Malfoy (ne  Greengrass). The school is stunned when, in a break with the tradition of Potters being sorted into Gryffindor, Albus is sorted into Slytherin alongside Scorpius.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth boys are bullied by other students over the next few years, Albus due to his perceived failure to live up to his parents, Scorpius due to unproven rumours that he is the son of Lord Voldemort. In addition, Albus and Harry begin to drift apart, owing to Albus's struggles with his father's shadow and Harry's uncertainty on how to deal with his son's issues. Albus also drifts apart from Rose, with whom he was friends before meeting Scorpius and was sorted into Gryffindor. Prior to Albus and Scorpius's fourth year, Albus gets into a fight with his father after he is given Harry's baby blanket and a love potion from Ron. During the fight, Harry accidentally says that he sometimes wishes Albus was not his son, and Albus spills the potion on the blanket.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry obtains a prototype of a more powerful version of the Time-Turner, built by a Slytherin contemporary of Harry's, Theodore Nott, that allows one to travel back several years into the past and change history. Simultaneously, Harry's scar begins to hurt again, causing him to become concerned that Voldemort may somehow be returning. Amos Diggory, who has become old and is cared for by his niece, Delphi Diggory, asks Harry to use the Time-Turner to prevent the death of his son, Cedric Diggory. After overhearing Harry refuse to help the Diggorys, Albus is inspired to do so himself and convinces Scorpius to help him. The two escape from the Hogwarts Express and the trolley operator, who is revealed to be a monster placed on the train to prevent students from escaping. The two arrive at St.?Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards in Yorkshire, where Amos lives, and team up with Delphi to steal the Time-Turner from Hermione's office, in the Ministry of Magic, while disguised with Polyjuice Potion.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowing that Cedric's death was the result of him winning the Triwizard Tournament alongside Harry, the boys use the Time-Turner to travel back to the first challenge of the Triwizard Tournament in 1994 and sabotage Cedric during the tournament's first task in the hope of preventing his victory. Instead, they only succeed in creating an alternate reality in which Ron and Hermione never married, and thus Rose was never born, and Albus was sorted into Gryffindor. Albus discovers that this was because they chose to disguise themselves as Durmstrang students, causing Hermione to become suspicious of Viktor Krum and go to the Yule Ball with Ron instead of Viktor. As a result, Ron never experienced the jealousy fundamental to his relationship with Hermione, fell in love with Padma Patil at the Ball, and eventually became married to her, having a son named Panju. Hermione, in turn, became a frustrated and mean professor at Hogwarts, teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt around the same time, Harry's fear that Voldemort may return increases as his scar continues to hurt and as he has Voldemort-related nightmares. After speaking with a portrait of Dumbledore, and being told by centaur Bane that a \\"dark cloud\\" is around Albus, he becomes convinced that Scorpius is a threat to Albus and tries to have the boys kept apart at Hogwarts by forcing a reluctant Minerva McGonagall, now Headmistress of Hogwarts, to keep tabs on Albus using the Marauder's Map, threatening to shut down the school otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbus and Scorpius's friendship is destroyed, but the two eventually reconcile after Albus steals Harry's old Invisibility Cloak from James Sirius (Albus older brother), and after McGonagall refuses to enforce Harry's request. Harry himself is persuaded to relent after a conversation with Draco and Ginny. Meanwhile, Albus and Scorpius decide to make another attempt to use the Time-Turner to change Cedric's fate, this time by humiliating him during the Triwizard Tournament's second task. When Scorpius returns to the present day, however, Albus is not with him, and Scorpius finds himself in a reality in which Harry is dead, and Lord Voldemort rules the wizarding world.\\r\\n\\r\\nScorpius discovers that ÿ as a result of his actions ÿ an embittered Cedric joined the Death Eaters and killed Neville Longbottom during the events of Deathly Hallows, preventing him from killing Nagini and allowing Voldemort to win the Battle of Hogwarts. With Harry now dead, Albus subsequently never existed, while Voldemort was able to completely consolidate power and transform the Ministry of Magic into a dictatorial regime. In the new timeline, Scorpius became a popular Head Boy and Quidditch star, helping the staff and students torment Muggle-borns. Dolores Umbridge became the new Headmistress of Hogwarts, and patrols the school with Dementors and a revived Inquisitorial Squad led by Scorpius. Draco Malfoy occupies Harry's old position as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement, using his post to encourage routine attacks on Muggles and bribe the Prime Minister to remain silent on the actions of the Death Eaters.\\r\\n\\r\\nA powerful dark figure called \\"The Augurey\\" leads the Ministry of Magic. With help from Ron, Hermione, and Severus Snape, now the final members of a dwindling anti-Voldemort resistance movement, Scorpius is able to use the Time-Turner to prevent the interference of Albus and his past self and restore the events of the original timeline, the alternate Ron, Hermione, and Snape sacrificing themselves to the Dementors in order to allow him to do so. Scorpius reunites with Albus, and the two boys are eventually found by their parents, as well as Ron and Hermione. Following these events, Harry scolds Albus for his actions, but the two nevertheless begin to reconcile.\\r\\n\\r\\nRealising the danger the Time-Turner poses and deciding their parents will continue to keep it (as Hermonie had done in the Ministry of Magic), Scorpius and Albus attempt to destroy it themselves, but they are joined by Delphi Diggory. Scorpius realizes that Delphi was in charge of the Ministry of Magic in the alternate timeline (from her tattoo of the wings of a magical bird, which she says is called an Augurey), and she takes them captive, later revealing her intention of restoring the alternate timeline.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the adults learn Albus and Scorpius were seen disappearing with Delphi, they confront Amos, only to discover Delphi is not his niece, but the daughter of Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange. Delphi had placed Amos under a \\"confundus\\" charm.  Searching her room, they discover she is following a prophecy that, if fulfilled, would lead to Lord Voldemort's return. Delphi takes the boys to the final challenge of the Triwizard Tournament, but Albus and Scorpius prevent her from acting, and Delphi uses the Time-Turner again to travel further back in time. She inadvertently takes the boys with her and then destroys the Time-Turner to leave them all stranded in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbandoned by Delphi, Albus and Scorpius discover they have been taken back to the night Harry's parents were killed at Godric's Hollow (30?October 1981), and assume Delphi is planning to kill Harry before Voldemort attempts to do so (which severely weakens Voldemort). Albus and Scorpius write an invisible message on Harry's baby blanket, knowing in the present (which is now also the night of the anniversary of the death of Harry's parents, when he often looks for his blanket as it is the only physical memento he has), the blanket would become stained with love potion and expose the message to Harry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Draco reveals the Time-Turner was actually a prototype for a perfected model owned by him (it was made for his father), but they remain unable to rescue the boys due to their uncertainty over which time period they have entered. After Harry receives the message from the boys, he and his allies use Draco's Time-Turner to travel back in time to save them and stop Delphi. While waiting for Delphi, they deduce she intends to convince Voldemort to abandon his doomed attempt to kill Harry, ensuring her father's survival and allowing her to be with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry disguises himself as Voldemort using Transfiguration to distract Delphi, and after a struggle, the group manages to subdue her. Rather than killing Delphi, it is decided that she will be brought to Azkaban Prison. Lord Voldemort then appears and is oblivious to the presence of Harry and the group. The group allows the murder of Harry's parents to play out again, unwilling to risk the consequences of altering the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all stand with Harry to watch the sad event replay.  After returning to the present day, Delphi is sent to Azkaban. Albus and Scorpius now decide to be more active at Hogwarts, with Scorpius expressing interest in trying out for Quidditch and asking Rose on a date. Harry and Albus visit Cedric's grave, with Harry apologizing for his role in Cedric's death. Albus has also witnessed the death of a fellow student Craig Bowker?Jr (the only current timeline murder in the play), who tried to intervene when Delphi held Albus and Scorpius captive on the Quidditch pitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2013, it was revealed that a stage play based on Harry Potter had been in development for around a year,[3] with the view to bringing it to the stage sometime in 2016.[4] At the time of the announcement, Rowling revealed that the play would \\"explore the previously untold story of Harry's early years as an orphan and outcast\\".[5] The following May, Rowling began establishing the creative team for the project.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 26 June 2015, the project was officially confirmed under the title of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,[7] and it was revealed it would receive its world premiere in mid-2016 at London's Palace Theatre.[8] The announcement marked the eighteenth anniversary of the publication of the first Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,[9] published on 26 June 1997.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn announcing plans for the project, Rowling stated that the play would not be a prequel.[11] In response to queries regarding the choice of a play rather than a new novel, Rowling has stated that she \\"is confident that when audiences see the play they will agree that it is the only proper medium for the story\\".[12] Rowling has also assured audiences that the play will contain an entirely new story and will not be a rehashing of previously explored content.[13] On 24 September 2015, Rowling announced that the play had been split into two parts.[14] The parts are designed to be viewed on the same day or consecutively over two evenings.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 October 2015, it was confirmed the plays were set nineteen years after the conclusion of the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,[17] and would open at London's Palace Theatre in July 2016.[18] The plays principally follow Harry, now Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and his younger son Albus Severus Potter.[19] As of 22 July 2016, little more had been revealed about the plot even by those who had attended the previews since 7 June.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe producers and Rowling have maintained a campaign called #KeepTheSecrets to ask people who have seen the play not to reveal its major twists.  The slogan is printed on the tickets for the play and badges with the slogan are handed out for free during intervals. People buying their tickets online are emailed a video after the play from J.K.

Some websites were listing all three as authors of the script[22] but by 26 July 2016, the official web site for the play[23] and many others (including the BBC)[24] were listing Thorne as the sole script writer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is directed by John Tiffany[25][26] with choreography by Steven Hoggett,[27] set design by Christine Jones,[28] costume design by Katrina Lindsay,[29] lighting design by Neil Austin,[30] music by Imogen Heap,[31] and sound design by Gareth Fry.[32] In addition, special effects were created by Jeremy Chernick,[33] with illusions by Jamie Harrison, and musical supervision by Martin Lowe.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviews at the West End Palace Theatre, London began on 7 June 2016,[2] with the official opening night for both parts on 30 July,[35] and originally booking until 18?September 2016.[36] Tickets went on sale to pre-registered priority bookers on 28?October 2015, with a public sale scheduled to commence on 30?October.[37] In just under 8?hours of priority booking 175,000 tickets were sold for the world premiere production,[38] with the play's booking period extended to January 2017.[39] On commencement of the public sale booking was extended until 30?April 2017,[40] with a further extension issued the same day to 27?May 2017.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nTickets for the opening performance were priced from S30 up to S130 for a ticket for both parts,[42] although ticket resale agencies were selling seats for up to S3,000.[38] Ticket resale has been banned by the producers, with tickets no longer valid if sold on.[43] In mid-July?2016, the theatre began holding a ticket lottery at 1?pm each Friday, releasing 40 for sale on their website for some of the best seats in the theatre for the lowest price, advertised at S20?per part. For example, the \\"Friday Forty\\" tickets sold on 29?July 2016 were for performances on 3, 5, 6, and 7?August.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 20?December 2015, initial casting was announced with Jamie Parker playing Harry Potter, Noma Dumezweni playing Hermione Granger and Paul Thornley playing Ron Weasley.[45][46][47] The casting of the dark-skinned Noma Dumezweni as Hermione sparked fervent discussion, to which Rowling responded that Hermione's skin was never specified as white.[48][49] Further notable casting includes Poppy Miller as Ginny Potter, Alex Price as Draco Malfoy, Sam Clemmett as Albus Severus Potter and Anthony Boyle as Scorpius Malfoy.[50] The production features an overall cast of 42.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production began previews on 16 March 2018, officially opening on 22 April at the Lyric Theatre. Clemmett, Boyle, Dumezweni, Miller, Parker, Price and Thornley reprised their roles, from the West End.[53][54] The theatre removed 400 seats from the auditorium and moved the entrance to 43rd Street[55]. The production is produced by Sonia Friedman Productions,?Sir Colin Callender, and Harry Potter Theatrical Productions. Tickets initially went on sale through Ticketmaster Verified Fan on 18 October 2017, for performances from 16 March through 18 November 2018.[56]  The New York Times estimates that it is the most expensive non-musical Broadway play ever, incurring $68 million in opening costs.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 October 2017, the Michael Cassel Group announced that it will be producing the Australian premiere of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

Audiences and critics have complimented the casting and performances, while many debate the quality of the piece and how it compares to entries in the main Harry Potter series.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublications awarding five star ratings included The Independent, the London Evening Standard, The Stage and WhatsOnStage.com.[71][72][73][74] The Telegraph also gave five, although \\"there are some quibbles,\\" while The Guardian's Michael Billington awarded four stars.[75][76]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthony Boyle's performance as Scorpius Malfoy garnered particular acclaim. WhatsOnStage.com wrote that \\"Boyle gives a career-making performance,\\" while The Wall Street Journal described him as \\"the break-out performance\\".[74][77] Variety's critic, Matt Trueman, agreed, writing, \\"it's Boyle who really stands out\\", and both Trueman and Henry Hitchings, in the Evening Standard, noted that his performance was sure to be a fan favourite.[72][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe response to the play from the Harry Potter fandom was mixed. Some fans said the story seemed \\"like a work of fan fiction\\" and claimed that it diverged from previously established rules of the universe, criticising the script's characterisation.[79][80][81] Some also took issue with the style and plot of the script, complaining that the Time-Turner storylines had already been used, as had Cedric Diggory's death, and that the writers were rehashing old storylines.[82][83] These criticisms have led to some of the fandom to reject the play as separate from the Potter canon.[84] Some potential plot holes in the story have been highlighted, such as the likelihood of Lord Voldemort's infertility, the speed at which Polyjuice Potion is created, the unexplained non-operation of the Fidelius Charm,[85][86] and Cedric Diggory's dramatic turn to becoming a Death Eater.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, some fans responded positively to the play and its characters, with Scorpius Malfoy being particularly popular.[89] Some fans commented that the dialogue between the familiar characters was \\"spot on\\",[90] celebrating it as a faithful continuation of the books.[91][92] Others have noted that the play sheds light on some of the relationships between the characters, such as Harry and Dumbledore's.[93] The response had been particularly positive among fans who watched the play on stage.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe play never explicitly states who the \\"Cursed Child\\" is.  There are several possible answers, including Delphi who is cursed by her parentage, Harry himself whose difficult childhood is the subject of several flashbacks in the play and who must accept and relive the death of his parents to conquer Lord Voldemort, Albus who at one stage Harry says he wished \\"was not his son\\" and can do no right in this father's eyes being \\"cursed\\" by the Potter reputation, Scorpius who is rumoured to be Lord Voldemort's child and whose mother dies during the play, and Cedric Diggory whose tragic death is a focus of the play, and whose death is also finally accepted as a necessary condition for future peace.[95]","input":"Who is the author of the cursed child?"},{"output":"no competitors","context":"American Ninja Warrior (sometimes abbreviated as ANW) is an American sports entertainment competition that is a spin-off of the Japanese television series Sasuke. It features hundreds of competitors attempting to complete a series of obstacle courses of increasing difficulty, trying to make it to the national finals on the Las Vegas Strip, in hopes of becoming an \\"American Ninja Warrior\\". To date only two competitors, rock-climbers Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten, have won the course and achieved \\"Total Victory\\". Caldiero is the only competitor to win the cash prize. The series began on the now-defunct cable channel G4 and now airs on NBC with encore episodes airing on USA Network and NBC Sports Network.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Ninja Warrior succeeded G4's American Ninja Challenge as the qualifying route for Americans to enter Sasuke. Beginning with the fourth season in 2012, regional finalists and wild card competitors competed on a nearly identical Mount Midoriyama course in Las Vegas, Nevada, rather than traveling to Japan to compete on Sasuke.\\r\\nAmerican Ninja Warrior was originally hosted by G4's American television personality Blair Herter, and actress and former television correspondent Alison Haislip. In the second season, American actor, comedian, and television host Matt Iseman joined the show, replacing Herter. Additionally, Jimmy Smith was brought in as a co-host, while Haislip was the sideline reporter. The panel remained the same throughout season three.\\r\\nFor season 4, skier Jonny Moseley was brought in as the new co-host, replacing Smith.[6] American journalist, sportscaster, and documentary filmmaker Angela Sun replaced Haislip.\\r\\nFor season 5, two newcomers were added. Sports analyst and former NFL football player Akbar Gbaja-Biamila replaced Moseley, while ESPN sportscaster and model Jenn Brown replaced Sun as sideline reporter.[7] The season five panel remained the same through the sixth season.\\r\\nFor season 7, CBS Sports reporter Kristine Leahy joined the show as the new sideline reporter, replacing Brown.[8] The roster stayed the same through season 9. The current panel consists of Iseman, Gbaja-Biamila, and Leahy.[9]\\r\\nPotential contestants go through a rigorous series of steps before the possibility of becoming the next American Ninja Warrior. Over 3,500 athletes have attempted to conquer Mount Midoriyama and become an American Ninja Warrior since the series began in 2009.\\r\\nThere are some requirements possible contestants have to meet before participating at a regional qualifier. Contestants must be legal residents of the US and be in decent physical shape. There is no upper age limit, but participants must be at least 21 years old. Contestants have to fill out a 20-page questionnaire and make a video about themselves.[10] The required length of the video has differed over the years. Submission video length requirements have varied from 2 to 8 minutes, depending on the season.[11][12] Producers select 100 applicants from each region to participate in their regional qualifiers. Producers also select 20 to 30 \\"walk-ons\\" who in some cases wait for weeks camping outside to get a chance on the course.[13] 1,000 people applied to compete in season one, 5,000 people in season 6,[14] 50,000 in season 7, and 70,000 in season 8.[13][15]\\r\\nIn each city, the competitors the producers have selected competing on a 6 - obstacle course in hopes of making it to the city finals. The top 30 finishers make it to the city finals. Also, in Season 9, the top 5 women make it. The first obstacle is the quintuple steps or the floating steps and is the same for the rest of the cities for that season. Then comes an obstacle that moves along tracks. Next is either a balance obstacle or an upper-body obstacle. The other type will be fourth. Fifth is usually a grip obstacle, and sixth is the Warped Wall. In Season 9, the balance or the grip obstacle is an obstacle previously found in Stage 1 of Mount Midoryama. The obstacles are given by the sideline reporter at the beginning of every episode.\\r\\nCity finals courses are the follow-up to each city qualifying course. Qualifying and finals courses are filmed back-to-back, usually over two days. The top 15 finishers overall from each city finals course move on to compete in the National Finals. In addition, as of season 9, the top two women in each city finals are guaranteed to advance, even if they do not finish in the top 15. Small prizes ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 are awarded to first, second, and third finishers who complete the finals course.[16]\\r\\nMount Midoriyama is the finals course for American Ninja Warrior. Located on the Las Vegas strip, it consists of four stages, each containing various obstacles of increasing difficulty. Competitors must complete all of the 23 obstacles. Should they complete the first three stages, competitors will advance to Stage 4, where competitors attempt to climb the 75-foot rope climb, known as Mount Midoriyama, in 30 seconds or less.[17] Should a competitor achieve Total Victory, he or she receives a money prize of $500,000 from season 4 to season 6, and $1,000,000 from season 7. Beginning in season 8, if multiple competitors complete stage 4, the competitors split the prize money, although in prior years the fastest competitor would receive the full amount.[16]\\r\\nThe first season of American Ninja Warrior was held in Los Angeles, where hundreds of competitors came to challenge themselves against the course and qualify for a shot at making it to Japan to compete in Sasuke 23 later in the year. The special premiered on December 12, 2009, on G4 TV and was hosted by G4's Blair Herter and Alison Haislip. Notable competitors this season included freerunners Levi Meeuwenberg and Brian Orosco, mixed martial artist Jason \\"Mayhem\\" Miller, and Hollywood stuntman Rich King.\\r\\nOut of the ten Americans who qualified to compete at Mount Midori in Japan, only Rich King, Levi Meeuwenberg and Brian Orosco successfully completed Stage 1. The majority of the American Ninja Warrior competitors ran out of time or failed the obstacles. Levi Meeuwenberg was the only American competitor to complete Stage 2. The sole American competitor on Stage 3, he fell on the \\"Shin-Cliffhanger\\", and his run came to an end.[18]\\r\\nThe second season premiered on December 8, 2010, on G4 and concluded on January 2, 2011. It began in Venice Beach, California, where 300 competitors took on the course. The 15 semi-finalists moved on to the \\"Ninja Warrior Boot Camp\\" in the remote California mountains, where they competed in a series of team challenges. Then the finalists moved on to compete in the season finale of American Ninja Warrior 2 as a part of Sasuke 26 at Mount Midori in Japan. No competitor made it beyond Stage 3.\\r\\nThe third season began airing on July 31, 2011, on G4 and concluded with the finale airing on August 22, 2011, as a two-hour primetime special on NBC.[19][20] Tryouts took place in May 2011 at Venice Beach, California. After the tryouts, the top 15 competitors competed in Ninja Warrior Boot Camp with the top 10 moving on to Japan for the finals of the competition as a part of Sasuke 27 and a chance at becoming the first American to conquer the course and win a $500,000 endorsement deal with K-Swiss. No competitors made it beyond Stage 3.\\r\\nThe fourth season of American Ninja Warrior began airing on May 20, 2012, on both G4 and NBC. There were six regional competitions held in three locations: Venice Beach (Southwest and Northwest), Dallas (Midwest and Midsouth), and Miami (Northeast and Southeast), that determined the 100 competitors to participate in the qualifying rounds. The winner of the ANW season 4 competition would receive $500,000 and the coveted \\"American Ninja Warrior\\" title. The season finale, held in Las Vegas, was the first time that Mount Midori was held on U.S. soil. Submission videos for American Ninja Warrior season 4 had been collected since January 25, 2012.[21]\\r\\nThe entire format was changed as well ÿ regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired, and the Mt. Midori course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow down its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple steps and the Warped wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midori. Brent Steffensen was the first American to defeat the Ultimate Cliffhanger on Stage 3, and he made it the farthest that season, falling on the Hang Climb. He was the only competitor to reach Stage 3 in this competition.\\r\\nThe fifth season of American Ninja Warrior premiered on June 30, 2013, on G4 with subsequent shows airing on NBC and G4.[22] Notably, the sideboard advertising along the course listed Esquire Network as the broadcaster as the fifth season was to premiere after G4's transition to Esquire on April 22, 2013. The network switch was eventually delayed to September 23, 2013, and Esquire took over Style Network's channel space instead. Because of this, additional reruns of the season aired on Saturday nights on NBC through the summer to maintain ratings momentum due to G4's lame duck status, with ANW being their only new program since they wound down all their original programming in January 2013. The success of the NBC re-airings led to the series being considered for NBC's main summer schedule for the next season.\\r\\nRegional competitions were held in Venice Beach, Baltimore, Miami, and Denver. Tryouts for the season began in February 2013[23] and ended with the last of the regional rounds taking place the following May.[24] The finale was once again held in Las Vegas. No one defeated Stage 3, but Brian Arnold fell on the last obstacle, the Flying Bar, making him the farthest-going American on the Mount Midori course since Kane Kosugi reached the final stage on Sasuke 8.\\r\\nThe sixth season of American Ninja Warrior premiered on May 26, 2014, on NBC with subsequent shows airing on Monday nights at 9:00 pm EST[25] and Tuesday nights at 8:00 pm EST on Esquire Network.[26] Regional competitions were held at Venice Beach, Dallas, St. Louis, Miami, and Denver. The season finale was again held in Las Vegas, the permanent home of the U.S. version of Mount Midori. Notable competitors this season included The Biggest Loser personal trainer Kim Lyons, U.S. Olympic gymnasts Jonathan Horton and Terin Humphrey, among others. Female competitor Kacy Catanzaro became the first female to make it up the \\"Warped Wall\\" in the Dallas Qualifiers. Later in the Dallas Finals, she became the first woman to complete that finals course, in 8 minutes, 59 seconds. Again, no competitor achieved \\"total victory\\". Kacy's run has over ten million views. Joe Moravsky, the \\"Weatherman\\", made it farther than anyone on Season 6, falling on the Hang Climb, where Brent Steffensen failed two years ago.\\r\\nThe seventh season of American Ninja Warrior premiered on NBC on May 25, 2015. This season's grand prize was increased from $500,000 to $1,000,000. Qualifying and finals courses were held in Venice Beach, Kansas City, Houston, Orlando, Pittsburgh, as well as a special military-only course in San Pedro. Stage 1 had a total of 38 finishers including Brent Steffensen and Dustin McKinney. In Stage 2, 30 of the 38 competitors failed. Only eight were remaining in Stage 3 including Drew Dreschel, Abel Gonzalez, Isaac Caldiero, Ian Dory, Jeremiah Morgan, Kevin Bull, Joe Moravsky and Geoff Britten. Only two competitors finished the course: Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten. It was the first time that any American had finished Stage 3. The season concluded with a victory: Geoff Britten was the first to complete Stage 4 with a second remaining; however, Isaac Caldiero achieved the Stage 4 rope climb in a faster time and was awarded the grand prize of $1,000,000 and the title of \\"American Ninja Warrior\\". Geoff Britten was the first Ninja to complete all six courses in a single season.\\r\\nSeason 8 of American Ninja Warrior began on June 1, 2016, on NBC, with encore episodes airing the following day on Esquire Network. Regional competitions were held in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Indianapolis, Oklahoma City, and Philadelphia, with 28 new obstacles. Over 40 percent more women registered for season 8 compared to the previous season. Additionally, prize money for possible Stage 4 winners would now be split equally among competitors who complete the rope climb in under 30 seconds.[16]\\r\\nIn Philadelphia's city finals, no competitors completed the finals course, a first in American Ninja Warrior history. In Stage 1 of the National Finals, many veterans of the show such as Geoff Britten and Brent Steffensen were eliminated early, while Jessie Graff became the first woman to complete Stage 1, placing fifth.[27] Tyler Yamauchi became the shortest person ever to complete the Jumping Spider obstacle at 5'1\\". Only 17 competitors successfully completed Stage 1, the lowest in ANW history.[27] On Stage 2, all athletes were eliminated except Drew Drechsel and Daniel Gil. During Stage 3, both Drechsel and Gil could not complete the course. Gil fell on the Ultimate Cliffhanger, while Drechsel went the farthest, but fell on the Hang Climb. Contrary to season 7's multiple winners, no season 8 competitor was even able to complete Stage 3.\\r\\nSeason 9 of American Ninja Warrior began on June 12, 2017, on NBC. The premiere was preceded by a special episode, \\"Celebrity Ninja Warrior\\" on May 25, 2017, the U.S. Red Nose Day, which was followed by a \\"USA vs. the World\\" special on June 4. New for season 9, the top 5 women in each city qualifying course qualified for the city finals course, and the top two women in each city finals qualify for national finals, regardless of their placement overall. Also this season, fans are given the opportunity to design their own obstacles through ANW Obstacle Design Challenge and 7 fan-submitted obstacles has been featured in the show.\\r\\nDuring the season 5 finale of American Ninja Warrior, NBC announced that a special \\"USA vs. Japan\\" matchup would take place, the first-ever team competition in American Ninja Warrior's history.[28] The two-hour special premiered on January 13, 2014, at 8 pm EST on NBC and matched five Japanese Sasuke All-Stars and New Stars - heroes of the original Ninja Warrior - against five American stars representing American Ninja Warrior at the American reconstruction of the Mount Midoriyama course in Las Vegas. At stake was the United States vs. Japan championship; also branded as the first world championship for Sasuke/American Ninja Warrior, and a trophy to match. The special featured American Ninja Warrior's regular broadcasting crew: analysts Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila along with sideline reporter Jenn Brown.\\r\\nThe teams faced off on each stage in turn, with each stage hosting its own round of five one-on-one matches and no competitor allowed to run the same stage twice. The first national team to win three matches out of five earned the point(s) for that stage. Stage One was worth one point, while Stage Two was worth two points and Stage Three was worth three. In the event of a 3-3 tie after the first three stages, the tiebreaker would be a one-off showdown where each country would pick one team member for a race to the top of the Final Stage.\\r\\nThe winners of the special were the Americans over Japan.\\r\\nFinal Score: Americans: 6, Japan: 0.\\r\\nRosters\\r\\nDuring the Season 6 finale, NBC announced that another special entitled \\"USA vs. the World\\" matchup would take place in Las Vegas under a new format. On September 15, Team USA competed against a returning Team Japan, and a new team, Team Europe. This was the \\"Second Annual International Competition\\" that pitted top competitors from the United States American Ninja Warrior, Japan Ninja Warrior (Sasuke), and also European All Stars.[29] The three-hour special aired on September 15, 2014, on NBC with an encore airing September 16, 2014, on Esquire. The special once again was hosted by hosts Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila as well as sideline reporter Jenn Brown.\\r\\nThe winners of the special were the Europeans, winning over America and Japan.\\r\\nRosters\\r\\nTeam rosters were revealed late summer 2014.[30]\\r\\nFinal Score: Europe: 10, USA: 9, Japan: 0\\r\\nHighlights\\r\\nJoe Moravsky beat Brent Steffenson's record (from ANW 4) for the fastest time in Stage 1, beating Steffenson's time of 1:14.53 with a time of 1:12.72.

It is present in Unicode as .mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace}U+00B6 ? PILCROW SIGN (HTML?&#182;?{ &para;).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilcrow can be used as an indent for separate paragraphs or to designate a new paragraph in one long piece of copy, as Eric Gill did in his 1930s book An Essay on Typography. The pilcrow was a type of rubrication used in the Middle Ages to mark a new train of thought, before the convention of visually discrete paragraphs was commonplace.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilcrow is usually drawn similar to a lowercase q reaching from descender to ascender height; the loop can be filled or unfilled. It may also be drawn with the bowl stretching further downwards, resembling a backwards D; this is more often seen in older printing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word pilcrow originates from the Greek word paragraphos. This was rendered in Old French as paragraphe and later changed to pelagraphe. The earliest reference of the modern pilcrow is in 1440 with the Middle English word pylcrafte.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first way to divide sentences into groups in Ancient Greek was the original paragraphos, which was a horizontal line in the margin to the left of the main text.[6] As the paragraphos became more popular, the horizontal line eventually changed into the Greek letter Gamma (æ and ) and later into litterae notabiliores, which were enlarged letters at the beginning of a paragraph.[7] This notation soon changed to the letter K, an abbreviation for the Latin word kaput, which translates as \\"head\\", i.e. it marks the head of a new thesis.[8] Eventually, to mark a new section, the Latin word capitulum, which translates as \\"little head\\", was used, and the letter C came to mark a new section in 300 BC.[9] In the 1100s, C had completely replaced K as the symbol for a new chapter.[10] Rubricators eventually added one or two vertical bars to the C to stylize it (as ?); the symbol was filled in with dark ink and eventually looked like the modern pilcrow (?).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nScribes would often leave space before paragraphs to allow rubricators to draw the pilcrow. With the introduction of the printing press, space before paragraphs was still left for rubricators to draw by hand; however, rubricators could not draw fast enough for printers and often would leave the beginnings of the paragraphs as blank. This is how the indent before paragraphs was created.[12] Nevertheless, the pilcrow remains in use in modern time in the following ways:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn legal writing, it is used whenever one must cite a specific paragraph within pleadings, law review articles, statutes, or other legal documents and materials.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn academic writing, it is sometimes[citation needed] used as an in-text referencing tool to make reference to a specific paragraph from a document that does not contain page numbers, allowing the reader to find where that particular idea or statistic was sourced. The pilcrow sign followed by a number indicates the paragraph number from the top of the page. It is rarely used when citing books or journal articles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn proofreading, it indicates that one paragraph should be split into two or more separate paragraphs. The proofreader inserts the pilcrow at the point where a new paragraph should begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some high-church Anglican and Episcopal churches, it is used in the printed order of service to indicate that instructions follow; these indicate when the congregation should stand, sit, and kneel, who participates in various portions of the service, and similar information. King's College, Cambridge uses this convention in the service booklet for the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols. This is analogous to the writing of these instructions in red in some rubrication conventions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnline, it is used in some blogs and wikis to denote permalinks[13] (cf. Purple Numbers[clarify]).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilcrow is used in desktop publishing software such as desktop word processors and page layout programs to mark the presence of a carriage return control character at the end of a paragraph. It is also used as the icon on a toolbar button that shows or hides the pilcrow and similar hidden characters, including tabs, whitespace, and page breaks. In typing programs, it marks a return that one must type.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilcrow may indicate a footnote in a convention using a sequence of distinct typographic symbols in sequence to distinguish the footnotes on a given page; it is the sixth in a series of footnote symbols beginning with the asterisk.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilcrow symbol is available in the default hardware codepage 437 of IBM PCs (and all other 8-bit OEM codepages based on this) at code point 20 (0x14), sharing its position with the ASCII control code DC4 (to the effect that it isn't easily accessible in most software under this position).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilcrow character was in the 1984 Multinational Character Set extension of ASCII at 0xB6 (decimal 182), from where it was inherited by ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987) and by Unicode as U+00B6 ? PILCROW SIGN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe html entity is &para;, introduced in HTML 3.2 (1997). In LaTeX, the pilcrow glyph is invoked by \\\\P or \\\\textpilcrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from U+00B6 ?

This same mark also serves as a zero character, as a stylistic variation of the Chinese character for zero. As a paragraph sign, this mark only appears in older books, commonly found in the Chinese Union Version of the Bible. Its current use is generally as a zero character. However, it can also be found in some editions of the King James Bible and the Book of Mormon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Thai, the character U+0E5B ?

Alabama\\r\\nThe Purple Gang, also known as the Sugar House Gang, was a mob of bootleggers and hijackers, with predominantly Jewish members. They operated in Detroit, Michigan, during the 1920s and came to be Detroit's dominant criminal gang, but ultimately excessive violence and infighting caused the gang to self-destruct in the 1930s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1917, three years before national Prohibition, liquor became illegal in Michigan.[1][2] (Henry Ford, who owned the River Rouge plant, desired a sober workforce and backed the 1916 Damon Act.) Due to Detroit's proximity to Ohio, bootleggers and other people imported booze from Toledo.[2] Judges took a lenient view of offenders, and in 1919 the Damon Act was declared unconstitutional.[3]\\r\\nIn 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment was adopted, and prohibition took effect throughout the United States.[2] Canada became a major port for running alcohol products because the Canadian federal government approved and licensed distilleries and breweries to manufacture, distribute, and export alcohol.[1][2]\\r\\nLike most major cities at the beginning of the 20th-century, Detroit's immigrant neighborhoods were stricken with poverty and some became breeding grounds for crime and violence.[4] From the Hastings Street neighborhood known as Paradise Valley in Detroit's lower east side, most of the Purple Gang's core members went to Bishop School where all were placed in the division for problem children.[5] The gang members were the children of immigrants from eastern Europe, primarily Russia and Poland, who had come to the United States in the great immigration wave from 1881 to 1914.[6]\\r\\nThe gang of boys were led by four brothers: Abe, Joe, Raymond and (Isadore) Izzy Burnstein,[7] who had moved to Detroit from New York City.[8]\\r\\nThey started off as petty thieves and shakedown artists,[4][5] soon progressing to the more lucrative areas of crime such as armed robbery, extortion, and hijacking under the tutelage of older neighborhood gangsters (Charles Leiter and Henry Shorr).[5][7][9]\\r\\nThey received notoriety for their operations and savagery,[4] and imported gangsters from other American cities to work as \\"muscle\\" for the gang.[5] There are numerous theories as to the origin of the name \\"Purple Gang\\". One explanation is that a member of the gang was a boxer who wore purple shorts during his bouts.[5] Another explanation is that the name came from a conversation between two shopkeepers:\\r\\nThe Purples became hijackers and gained a reputation for stealing the booze cargoes of the older and more established gangs.[4] As their reputation for \\"terror\\" grew, people began to fear them - Al Capone was against expanding his rackets in Detroit and began a business accommodation with the Purples in order to prevent a bloody war.[5] For several years, the Purples managed the prosperous business of supplying Canadian whisky, Old Log Cabin, to the Capone organization in Chicago.[8][10] The Purples were involved in various criminal enterprises. They were also involved in kidnapping other gangsters for ransom, which had become very popular during this era. They were reportedly suspected by the FBI to have been involved with the Lindbergh baby kidnapping.[5][11]\\r\\nBy the late 1920s, The Purple Gang reigned supreme over the Detroit underworld, controlling the citys vice, gambling, liquor, and drug trade.[12] They also ran the local wire service, providing horse racing information to local horse betting parlors and handbooks.[1] The gang members consorted with some more infamous mobsters, branching out into other cities, as well. Abe Burnstein was a friend of Meyer Lansky and Joe Adonis, with whom he owned several Miami gambling casinos in his later years.[13] The gang hijacked prizefight films and forced movie theaters to show the films for a high fee. They also defrauded insurance companies by staging fake accidents.[8]\\r\\nAs the gang grew in size and influence, they began hiring themselves out as hitmen[13] and took part in the Cleaners and Dyers war. The Purples profited from the Detroit laundry industry unions and associations.[7] They were hired out to keep union members in line and to harass non-union independents.[7] Bombing, arson, theft, and murder were the usual tactics that the gang employed to enforce union policy.[5][13]\\r\\nAbe Axler and Eddie Fletcher were reputedly imported from New York City to take part in the scheme (other sources put their origins in Detroit) [5][9] In 1927, nine members of the Purple Gang (Abe Burnstein, Raymond Burnstein, Irving Milberg, Eddie Fletcher, Joe Miller, Irving Shapiro, Abe Kaminsty, Abe Axler and Simon Axler), were arrested and charged with conspiracy to extort money from Detroit Wholesale Cleaners & Dyers.[13] They were eventually acquitted of all charges.[5]\\r\\nHarry Rosman (1891-1958) was president and owner of Famous Cleaners & Dyers in Detroit, Michigan. He gained notoriety in the news[14] for being the key witness testifying against the infamous Purple Gang in a trial that lasted from 1928-1929. The prosecution alleged extortion activities against Detroit area businesses during the sometime violent showdown known as the Cleaners & Dyers Wars. Harry testified under oath that the Purple Gang asked for $1000 per week from his and other area cleaners & dyers' businesses[15] for their \\"protection\\" against violence.\\r\\nA Detroit Mob War soon ensued between the Italian, Irish, and Jewish bootleggers over territory. The Purples fought a vicious turf war with the Licavoli Squad led by the brothers Tommy and Pete Licavoli.[1][3] In March 1927, three men were killed. The deceased men had been brought into Detroit as hired assassins for the Purple Gang and the motive for the murder was believed to be retaliation for a \\"double cross\\". The homicides took place in an apartment leased by Purple Gang members, Eddie Fletcher and Abe Axler (and reportedly Fred Burke[9]), which made them prime suspects in the slaying. The three suspects (Fletcher, Axler, and Burke) were questioned, as were the other Purples and associates.[16] No one was ever convicted of the murder.[5] This was reportedly the first use of a machine gun in a Detroit underworld slaying.[17]\\r\\nThe Purple Gang was reputedly suspected of taking part in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.[8] On February 13, 1929, Abe Burnstein had reputedly called Bugs Moran and told him that a hijacked load of booze was on its way to Chicago. Moran, who was in the middle of a turf war with Capone, had only recently begun to trust Burnstein, who had previously been Capone's chief supplier of Canadian liquor.[13] The next day, instead of delivering a load of liquor, five men dressed as policemen went to S.M.C. Cartage on North Clark Street (Moran's North Side hangout) and opened fire with machine guns, killing seven men in what has become known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.[13]\\r\\nThe Purple Gang began terrorizing Detroiters with the street executions of their enemies,[1] killing a police officer named Vivian Welsh on February 1, 1927, who was later revealed to be a dirty cop and was reputedly trying to extort money from the Purple Gang[18] and in 1930, murdering well-known radio personality Jerry Buckley in the lobby of a downtown hotel.[1][19] Whether the Purples were involved with Buckley's death is questionable, as the police suspected the local Sicilian mob.[20] No one was charged in either case, and both of the murders remain officially unsolved.[18][20]\\r\\nIn 1931, an inter-gang dispute ended in the murder of three Purples by members of their own gang - Chicago gangsters who had been imported to Detroit to help out the Purple Gang.[5] The three men had violated an underworld code by operating outside the territory allotted to them by the Purple Gang leadership.[7] Herman \\"Hymie\\" Paul, Isadore Sutker a.k.a. \\"Joe Sutker\\", and Joseph Nigger Joe Lebowitz,[21] were lured to an apartment on Collingwood Avenue on September 16, 1931. They believed they were going to a peace conference with the Purple leaders.[7] After a brief discussion, the three men were gunned down.[21] Authorities caught up with the gang when they burst into Fletcher's apartment and found the suspects (Abe Axler, Irving Milberg, and Eddie Fletcher) playing cards. Ray Burnstein and Harry Keywell were also arrested.[21]\\r\\nIrving Milberg, Harry Keywell, and Raymond Burnstein, three high-ranking Purples, were convicted of first-degree murder in the Collingwood Manor Massacre and were sentenced to prison for life.[7] Burnstein, Milberg, and Keywell boarded a special Pullman train bound for Michigan's Upper Peninsula to begin serving their sentences in the state's maximum security prison in Marquette.[22] Harry Fleisher, another possible suspect, remained on the lam until 1932, but he was never convicted in connection with the massacre. Later on, he served time in Jackson Prison, the world's largest walled prison, in the early 1950s for armed robbery of an Oakland County gambling house.[22] According to Detroit Police Chief of Detectives, James E. McCarty, the convictions in the Collingwood Massacre, \\"broke the back of the once powerful Purple Gang, writing finis to more than five years of arrogance and terrorism\\".[22]\\r\\nFor many years, the Purples enjoyed seemingly complete immunity from police interference as witnesses to crimes were terrified of testifying against any criminal identified as a Purple gangster.[7] The Purple Gang reputedly became more arrogant and sloppy as time progressed. They dressed flamboyantly and were well-known to the public and the city's night spots. They lived in fine houses and soon a romantic aura surrounded the Purples that distinguished them from the other gangs in Detroit.[8] Jealousies, egos, and inter-gang quarrels would eventually cause the Purple Gang to collapse.[7][9] The police eventually moved against them as gang members began leaving behind too much evidence of their crimes.\\r\\nPhillip Keywell had already been convicted for a senseless murder, and Joe Burnstein and Abe Burnstein both were given hefty prison sentences after previously escaping heavy jail time through intimidation and corrupt officials. Different waves of bloodier-than-previous infighting ensued, with the aggressive and high-ranking members Abe Axler and Eddie Fletcher getting shot dead, then one-time partial-boss (there wasn't a strict hierarchy) Henry Shorr killed in further infighting. Some gangsters drifted away, a few fleeing Detroit,[23] others were executed by fellow members or rival gangsters,[7] and several members were subsequently imprisoned.[22] A rival Sicilian gang, tired of competing with the Purples, also eventually decided to eliminate them.[8]\\r\\nThe gang continued in a diminished capacity, but the predecessors of Detroits modern-day Mafia stepped in and filled the void as The Purple Gang, ultimately, self-destructed.[1][7][9]\\r\\nAlthough heavily fictionalized, the 1935 film Public Hero No. 1 deals with the hunting down and capture of the Purple Gang.\\r\\nThey are referenced in the 1957 film Jailhouse Rock in the song of the same name: \\"The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.\\"","input":"Who was the leader of the purple gang?"},{"output":"ancestors","context":"The study of Roman sculpture is complicated by its relation to Greek sculpture. Many examples of even the most famous Greek sculptures, such as the Apollo Belvedere and Barberini Faun, are known only from Roman Imperial or Hellenistic \\"copies.\\" At one time, this imitation was taken by art historians as indicating a narrowness of the Roman artistic imagination, but, in the late 20th century, Roman art began to be reevaluated on its own terms: some impressions of the nature of Greek sculpture may in fact be based on Roman artistry.\\r\\nThe strengths of Roman sculpture are in portraiture, where they were less concerned with the ideal than the Greeks or Ancient Egyptians, and produced very characterful works, and in narrative relief scenes. Examples of Roman sculpture are abundantly preserved, in total contrast to Roman painting, which was very widely practiced but has almost all been lost. Latin and some Greek authors, particularly Pliny the Elder in Book 34 of his Natural History, describe statues, and a few of these descriptions match extant works. While a great deal of Roman sculpture, especially in stone, survives more or less intact, it is often damaged or fragmentary; life-size bronze statues are much more rare as most have been recycled for their metal.[1]\\r\\nMost statues were actually far more lifelike and often brightly colored when originally created; the raw stone surfaces found today is due to the pigment being lost over the centuries.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Roman art was influenced by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring Etruscans, themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners. An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in terracotta, usually lying on top of a sarcophagus lid propped up on one elbow in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding Roman Republic began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the Parthian far east, official and patrician sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period.[3] By the 2nd century BCE, \\"most of the sculptors working at Rome\\" were Greek,[4] often enslaved in conquests such as that of Corinth (146 BCE), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.[5]\\r\\nA native Italian style can be seen in the tomb monuments of prosperous middle-class Romans, which very often featured portrait busts, and portraiture is arguably the main strength of Roman sculpture. There are no survivals from the tradition of masks of ancestors that were worn in processions at the funerals of the great families and otherwise displayed in the home, but many of the busts that survive must represent ancestral figures, perhaps from the large family tombs like the Tomb of the Scipios or the later mausolea outside the city. The famous \\"Capitoline Brutus\\", a bronze head supposedly of Lucius Junius Brutus is very variously dated, but taken as a very rare survival of Italic style under the Republic, in the preferred medium of bronze.[6] Similarly stern and forceful heads are seen in the coins of the consuls, and in the Imperial period coins as well as busts sent around the Empire to be placed in the basilicas of provincial cities were the main visual form of imperial propaganda; even Londinium had a near-colossal statue of Nero, though far smaller than the 30 metre high Colossus of Nero in Rome, now lost.[7] The Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker, a successful freedman (c. 50-20 BC) has a frieze that is an unusually large example of the \\"plebeian\\" style.[8]\\r\\nThe Romans did not generally attempt to compete with free-standing Greek works of heroic exploits from history or mythology, but from early on produced historical works in relief, culminating in the great Roman triumphal columns with continuous narrative reliefs winding around them, of which those commemorating Trajan (CE 113) and Marcus Aurelius (by 193) survive in Rome, where the Ara Pacis (\\"Altar of Peace\\", 13 BCE) represents the official Greco-Roman style at its most classical and refined. Among other major examples are the earlier re-used reliefs on the Arch of Constantine and the base of the Column of Antoninus Pius (161),[9] Campana reliefs were cheaper pottery versions of marble reliefs and the taste for relief was from the imperial period expanded to the sarcophagus.\\r\\nAll forms of luxury small sculpture continued to be patronized, and quality could be extremely high, as in the silver Warren Cup, glass Lycurgus Cup, and large cameos like the Gemma Augustea, Gonzaga Cameo and the \\"Great Cameo of France\\".[10] For a much wider section of the population, moulded relief decoration of pottery vessels and small figurines were produced in great quantity and often considerable quality.[11]\\r\\nAfter moving through a late 2nd century \\"baroque\\" phase,[12] in the 3rd century, Roman art largely abandoned, or simply became unable to produce, sculpture in the classical tradition, a change whose causes remain much discussed. Even the most important imperial monuments now showed stumpy, large-eyed figures in a harsh frontal style, in simple compositions emphasizing power at the expense of grace. The contrast is famously illustrated in the Arch of Constantine of 315 in Rome, which combines sections in the new style with roundels in the earlier full Greco-Roman style taken from elsewhere, and the Four Tetrarchs (c. 305) from the new capital of Constantinople, now in Venice. Ernst Kitzinger found in both monuments the same \\"stubby proportions, angular movements, an ordering of parts through symmetry and repetition and a rendering of features and drapery folds through incisions rather than modelling... The hallmark of the style wherever it appears consists of an emphatic hardness, heaviness and angularity  in short, an almost complete rejection of the classical tradition\\".[13]\\r\\nThis revolution in style shortly preceded the period in which Christianity was adopted by the Roman state and the great majority of the people, leading to the end of large religious sculpture, with large statues now only used for emperors, as in the famous fragments of a colossal acrolithic statue of Constantine, and the 4th or 5th century Colossus of Barletta. However rich Christians continued to commission reliefs for sarcophagi, as in the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus, and very small sculpture, especially in ivory, was continued by Christians, building on the style of the consular diptych.[14]\\r\\nEtruscan sarcophagus, 3rd century BCE\\r\\nThe \\"Capitoline Brutus\\", probably late 4th to early 3rd century BC, possibly 1st century BC.[15]\\r\\nA Roman naval bireme depicted in a relief from the Temple of Fortuna Primigenia in Praeneste (Palastrina),[16] which was built c. 120 BC;[17] exhibited in the Pius-Clementine Museum (Museo Pio-Clementino) in the Vatican Museums.\\r\\nThe Patrician Torlonia bust, believed to be of Cato the Elder. 1st century BC\\r\\nThe Orator, c. 100 BC, an Etrusco-Roman bronze statue depicting Aule Metele (Latin: Aulus Metellus), an Etruscan man wearing a Roman toga while engaged in rhetoric; the statue features an inscription in the Etruscan alphabet\\r\\nScipio Africanus, bronze bust, mid 1st century BC\\r\\nThe so-called \\"Togatus Barberini\\", a statue depicting a Roman senator holding portrait effigies (possibly imagines) of deceased ancestors; marble, late 1st century BC; head (not belonging): mid 1st century BC.\\r\\nThe Grave relief of Publius Aiedius and Aiedia, 30 BC, Pergamon Museum (Berlin)\\r\\nArles bust, marble bust found in the Rhone River near Arles, c. 46 BC\\r\\nRoman, Republican or Early Imperial, Relief of a seated poet (Menander) with masks of New Comedy, 1st century BC ÿ early 1st century AD, Princeton University Art Museum\\r\\nAugustus of Prima Porta, statue of the emperor Augustus, 1st century CE.

During the Roman Republic, it was considered a sign of character not to gloss over physical imperfections, and to depict men in particular as rugged and unconcerned with vanity: the portrait was a map of experience. During the Imperial era, more idealized statues of Roman emperors became ubiquitous, particularly in connection with the state religion of Rome. Tombstones of even the modestly rich middle class sometimes exhibit portraits of the otherwise unknown deceased carved in relief.\\r\\nAmong the many museums with examples of Roman portrait sculpture, the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the British Museum in London are especially noteworthy.\\r\\nReligious art was also a major form of Roman sculpture. A central feature of a Roman temple was the cult statue of the deity, who was regarded as \\"housed\\" there (see aedes). Although images of deities were also displayed in private gardens and parks, the most magnificent of the surviving statues appear to have been cult images. Roman altars were usually rather modest and plain, but some Imperial examples are modeled after Greek practice with elaborate reliefs, most famously the Ara Pacis, which has been called \\"the most representative work of Augustan art.\\"[21] Small bronze statuettes and ceramic figurines, executed with varying degrees of artistic competence, are plentiful in the archaeological record, particularly in the provinces, and indicate that these were a continual presence in the lives of Romans, whether for votives or for private devotional display at home or in neighborhood shrines. These typically show more regional variation in style than large and more official works, and also stylistic preferences between different classes.[22]\\r\\nRoman marble sarcophagi mostly date from the 2nd to the 4th century CE,[23] after a change in Roman burial customs from cremation to inhumation, and were mostly made in a few major cities, including Rome and Athens, which exported them to other cities. Elsewhere the stela gravestone remained more common. They were always a very expensive form reserved for the elite, and especially so in the relatively few very elaborately carved examples; most were always relatively plain, with inscriptions, or symbols such as garlands. Sarcophagi divide into a number of styles, by the producing area. \\"Roman\\" ones were made to rest against a wall, and one side was left uncarved, while \\"Attic\\" and other types were carved on all four sides; but the short sides were generally less elaborately decorated in both types.[24]\\r\\nThe time taken to make them encouraged the use of standard subjects, to which inscriptions might be added to personalize them, and portraits of the deceased were slow to appear. The sarcophagi offer examples of intricate reliefs that depict scenes often based on Greek and Roman mythology or mystery religions that offered personal salvation, and allegorical representations. Roman funerary art also offers a variety of scenes from everyday life, such as game-playing, hunting, and military endeavors.[25]\\r\\nEarly Christian art quickly adopted the sarcophagus, and they are the most common form of early Christian sculpture, progressing from simple examples with symbols to elaborate fronts, often with small scenes of the Life of Christ in two rows within an architectural framework. The Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus (c. 359) is of this type, asnd the earlier Dogmatic Sarcophagus rather simpler. The huge porphyry Sarcophagi of Helena and Constantina are grand Imperial examples.\\r\\nScenes from Roman sarcophagi\\r\\nScenes of Orphic religion (2nd century)\\r\\nPortonaccio sarcophagus with a battle\\r\\nDionysus riding a panther and accompanied by attendants, 220-230 AD\\r\\nChildren playing with nuts (3rd century)\\r\\nSarcophagus with the Calydonian hunt, Palazzo dei Senatori - Musei Capitolini, Rome.\\r\\nSarcophagus with the Four Seasons allegory\\r\\n(3rd century), Palazzo dei Senatori - Musei Capitolini, Rome.\\r\\nSarcophagus of the Quinta Flavia Severina, Palazzo dei Senatori - Musei Capitolini, Rome.\\r\\nEarly Christian marble sarcophagus with a high-relief representing scenes from the Old and the New Testament, c. 310 AD\\r\\nCast of Christ's trial before Pilate, with Pilate about to wash his hands.

Sculptures recovered from the site of the Gardens of Sallust, opened to the public by Tiberius, include:\\r\\nRoman baths were another site for sculpture; among the well-known pieces recovered from the Baths of Caracalla are the Farnese Bull and Farnese Hercules and over life-size early 3rd century patriotic figures somewhat reminiscent of Soviet Social Realist works (now in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples).\\r\\nFound in the Gardens of Sallust\\r\\nFalling Niobid, discovered in the site in 1906 (Museo Nazionale Romano)' a Greek original[26]\\r\\nBorghese Vase\\r\\nCaryatid statue, Palazzo dei Senatori - Musei Capitolini, Rome.\\r\\nFountain in the form of a horn-shaped drinking cup (rhyton), Palazzo dei Senatori - Musei Capitolini, Rome.\\r\\nChild with a theatre mask, for a garden or house, Palazzo Nuovo - Musei Capitolini, Rome.\\r\\nScenes shown on reliefs such as that of Trajan's column and those shown on sarcophogi reveal images of Roman technology now long lost, such as ballistae and the use of waterwheel-driven saws for cutting stone. The latter was only recently discovered at Hieropolis and commemorates the miller who used the machine. Other reliefs show harvesting machines, much as they were described by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia.\\r\\nCompared to the Greeks, the Romans made less use of stone sculpture on buildings, apparently having few friezes with figures. Important pediments, such as the Pantheon for example, originally had sculpture, but hardly any have survived. Terracotta relief panels called Campana reliefs have survived in good numbers. These were used to decorate interior walls, in strips.\\r\\nThe architectural writer Vitruvius is oddly reticent on the architectural use of sculpture, mentioning only a few examples, though he says that an architect should be able to explain the meaning of architectural ornament and gives as an example the use of caryatids.[27]","input":"Who were the subjects of most roman sculptures?"},{"output":"20th volume","context":"Sword Art Online is a Japanese light novel series written by Reki Kawahara with accompanying illustrations drawn by abec. The series takes place in the near-future and focuses on various virtual reality MMORPG worlds. Originally self-published online under the pseudonym Fumio Kunori,[1] ASCII Media Works began publishing the novels on April 10, 2009 under their Dengeki Bunko imprint.[2] The series has since grown to 18 volumes as of August 10, 2016 and the 20th volume was released on September 8, 2017.[3] Yen Press began publishing the novels in English in North America and United Kingdom with the first volume on April 22, 2014. The novels are also published in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand,[4] France,[5] and Poland.[6] With more than 16 million copies in print worldwide, there are future plans for publications in Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Vietnam and others.[4]\\r\\nKawahara also began writing a parallel series of light novels titled Sword Art Online: Progressive, a reboot of the original series' Aincrad arc. However, instead of covering the arc in one light novel, Kawahara plans to take a floor by floor approach of the Aincrad arc. The first volume was published on October 10, 2012[7] and four volumes have been published as of December 2015.\\r\\nIn addition to the original storyline of Sword Art Online and Sword Art Online: Progressive, Kawahara has also written and published Sword Art Online side stories. These side stories have been posted on his website,[8] in a collection of side stories in Accel World, have been sold at Comitia, Dengeki Bunko's Fair and have come along with the limited edition Blu-Ray/DVD Sword Art Online compilation volumes. Before Sword Art Online was published, Kawahara had posted Sword Art Online novels on his website and there are still a few side stories on Sword Art Online, although the original novels have been removed. In addition, Kawahara has published a side story of Sword Art Online in one of his other works, Accel World. In the tenth volume of Accel World, there is a chapter where it depicts a cross over between Sword Art Online and Accel World. Several of the side stories that he has released are in a collection called the Sword Art Online Material Edition, which range from novels to manga.

It took place in Uruguay from 13 to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America) entered the tournament. Only a few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4ÿ1 and Belgium 3ÿ0, respectively. Lucien Laurent of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while US goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the first official \\"clean sheet\\" in the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nArgentina, Uruguay, the United States and Yugoslavia each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favourites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4ÿ2 in front of a crowd of 68,346?people, and became the first nation to win the World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Hungary and Uruguay all lodged applications to host the event.[2][3] Uruguay's bid became the clear selection after all the other countries withdrew their bids.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first World Cup was the only one without qualification. Every country affiliated with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players,[2] very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances,[4] and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to The Football Association, even though the British Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929.[5] Two months before the start of the tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.[6]\\r\\nFIFA president Jules Rimet intervened, and eventually four European teams made the trip by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin R?dulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King Carol?II. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers to ensure that the players would still have jobs upon their return.[7] The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip.[8] The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nLucien Laurent[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Romanians boarded the SS Conte Verde at Genoa, the French were picked up at Villefranche-sur-Mer on 21 June 1930;[11] and the Belgians embarked at Barcelona.[12] The Conte Verde carried Rimet, the trophy and the three designated European referees: the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe, along with Thomas Balway, a Parisian who may have been English. The Brazilian team were picked up when the boat docked in Rio de Janeiro on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July.[6] Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship Florida from Marseille.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Kingdom of Yugoslavia there were doubts about their participation at first. Since the Croatians decided to boycott the national team, King Alexander I did not want to finance the whole idea, but in the end they found a solution. Belgrade football association officials decided to round up only domestic (Serbian) star players, mainly from two rival Belgrade clubs, BSK and SK Jugoslavija, with an additional three Serbs who played for French clubs (Ivan Bek among them). \\r\\nTherefore, the Yugoslavia team was exclusively made up of Serbian players; and with the two biggest stars of the team, Blagoje Marjanovi? (\\"Mo?a\\") and Aleksandar Tirnani? (\\"Tirke\\"), both from BSK, they were ready for a trip to South America to represent Yugoslavia in the World Cup. The Yugoslavians were the youngest team in the World Cup; with an average age of 21 years and 258 days. After their first match, against Brazil, they received a new nickname \\"The Ich-es\\" or \\"Ichachos\\" (in Spanish) by the Uruguayan press; referring to most of the player's surnames that ended up with the \\"-i?\\" or \\"-vi?\\" suffix, which is quite common for Serbian last names. They achieved the jointÿbiggest success in both Yugoslav and Serbian subsequent World Cup footballing history, by earning fourth place, a result that would be repeated in 1962.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll matches took place in Montevideo. Three stadiums were used: Estadio Centenario, Estadio Pocitos, and Estadio Parque Central. The Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence. Designed by Juan Scasso,[14] it was the primary stadium for the tournament, referred to by Rimet as a \\"temple of football\\".[15] With a capacity of 90,000, it was the largest football stadium outside the British Isles.[9] The stadium hosted 10 of the 18?matches, including both semi-finals and the final. However, a rushed construction schedule and delays caused by the rainy season meant the Centenario was not ready for use until five days into the tournament.[16] Early matches were played at smaller stadiums usually used by Montevideo football clubs Nacional and Pe?arol, the 20,000 capacity Parque Central and the Pocitos.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a list of all squads that appeared in the final tournament, see 1930 FIFA World Cup squads.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifteen referees participated in the tournament: four Europeans ÿ two Belgians (Henri Christophe and John Langenus), a Frenchman, and a Romanian (Constantin R?dulescu, also the Romanian team coach),[17] and eleven from the Americas ÿ among them six Uruguayans. In order to eliminate differences in the application of the Laws of the Game, the referees were invited to one short meeting to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the refereeing appointments, the two that attracted most attention were that of Gilberto de Almeida Rgo in the match between Argentina and France, in which the Brazilian referee blew for full-time six minutes early, and that of the Bolivian Ulises Saucedo's in the Argentina and Mexico encounter, which Argentina won 6ÿ3. During the game Saucedo, who was also the coach of Bolivia,[17] awarded three penalties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is the list of officials to serve as referees and linesmen. Officials in italics were only employed as linesmen during the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 13 teams were drawn into four groups, with Group 1 containing four teams, and the others containing  three. Each group played a round-robin format, with the four group winners progressing to the knockout semi-final stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nUruguay, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States were seeded, and were kept apart in the draw,[19] which took place in Montevideo once all the teams arrived.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince there were no qualifying games, the opening two matches of the tournament were the first World Cup games ever played, taking place simultaneously on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4ÿ1 at the Estadio Pocitos, while the United States defeated Belgium 3ÿ0 at the same time at the Estadio Gran Parque Central. France's Lucien Laurent was the scorer of the first World Cup goal.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLucien Laurent[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first group was the only one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries hindered France; goalkeeper Alex Thpot had to leave the field after 20?minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by Luis Monti, spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti free kick.[22] The game featured an officiating controversy when referee Almeida Rgo erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman Marcel Langiller clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players.[23] Though France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3ÿ0 win.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance's final match, against Chile, featured the first penalty kick of the World Cup . The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alex Thpot of France on 19 July 1930, saving from Chile's Carlos Vidal in the 30th minute of the match.[25] In Argentina's second match, against Mexico, three penalty kicks were awarded. During the same match on 19 July 1930 Mexico's Oscar Bonfiglio Martnez saved another penalty at the 23rd minute of the match against Argentina's Fernando Paternoster.[25] Guillermo Stbile scored a hat-trick in his international debut[26] as Argentina won 6ÿ3, despite the absence of their captain Manuel Ferreira, who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam.[27] Qualification was decided by the group's final match, contested by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico, respectively. The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti.[23] Argentina won 3ÿ1 against their neighbours and advanced to the semi-finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second group contained Brazil, Bolivia and Yugoslavia. Brazil, the group seeds, were expected to progress, but in the group's opening match, unexpectedly lost 2ÿ1 to Yugoslavia.[28] Going into the tournament Bolivia had never previously won an international match. For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each emblazoned with a single letter, spelling \\"Viva Uruguay\\" as the team lined up.[29] Both of Bolivia's matches followed a similar pattern, a promising start gradually transforming into heavy defeat. Against Yugoslavia, they held out for an hour before conceding, but were four goals down by the final whistle.[24] Misfortune played its part; several Bolivian goals were disallowed.[29] Against Brazil, when both teams had only pride to play for, the score was 1ÿ0 to Brazil at half-time. Brazil added three more in the second half, two of them scored by the multi-sportsman Preguinho.[30] Yugoslavia qualified for the semi-finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nHosts Uruguay were in a group with Peru and Romania. The opening match in this group saw the first player expulsion in the competition, when Plcido Galindo of Peru was dismissed against Romania. The Romanians made their man advantage pay; their 3ÿ1 win included two late goals. This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history. The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of construction delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five days into the tournament. The first to be held at the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper Andrs Mazali was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife.[32] One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1ÿ0.[33] Spectators praised Peru's defense, and this turned out to be the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal.[34] The result was viewed as a poor performance by the Uruguayan press, but lauded in Peru.[33] Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4ÿ0.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth group contained Belgium, Paraguay and The United States. The American team, which contained a significant number of new caps, were reputedly nicknamed \\"the shot-putters\\" by an unnamed source in the French contingent.[3] They beat their first opponents, Belgium, 3ÿ0. The ease of the victory was unexpected; Uruguayan newspaper Imparcial wrote that \\"the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts\\".[35] Belgian reports bemoaned the state of the pitch and refereeing decisions, claiming that the second goal was offside.[35] The group's second match, played in windy conditions,[36] witnessed the first tournament hat-trick, scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States against Paraguay. Until 10 November 2006, the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo Stbile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude; however, in 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as a goal previously assigned to teammate Tom Florie was reattributed to Patenaude.[37][38] With the United States having secured qualification, the final match in the group was a dead rubber. Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1ÿ0 margin.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, moved to the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw identical scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent.[39] A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1ÿ0 half-time lead. In the second half, the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6ÿ1 to Argentina.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second semi-final there were shades of the 1924 Summer Olympics match between Yugoslavia and Uruguay. Here, though, Yugoslavia took a surprise lead through Vujadinovi?. Uruguay then took a 2ÿ1 lead. Then shortly before half-time Yugoslavia had a goal disallowed by a controversial offside decision.[28] The hosts scored three more in the second half to win 6ÿ1, Pedro Cea completing a hat-trick.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe now-traditional third place play-off was not established until 1934, so the format of the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3ÿ1 by Yugoslavia.[41] Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they were upset with the refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the championship, the captains of the United States team (Tom Florie)[43] and Yugoslavia (Milutin Ivkovi?)[44] both received bronze medals. Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth, due to a better goal difference on otherwise identical records,[45] a practice since continued by FIFA.[46] In 2010, the son of Kosta Had?i, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Had?i himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals meant the final was a repeat of the matchup in the 1928 Olympic final, which Uruguay had won 2ÿ1 after a replay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final was played at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine supporters crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte (\\"victory or death\\"), dispelling any uncertainty as to whether the tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate,[28] and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10ÿ15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium.[49] At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons.[50] The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full,[28] the official attendance 93,000.[51] A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second.[3] Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness.[40] Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats on the eve of the match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety.[52] One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts scored the opening goal through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a position on the right.[54] Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and equalised.[54] Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stbile gave Argentina a 2ÿ1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stbile was offside, but to no avail.[52] In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3ÿ1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equaliser.[54] Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4ÿ2 to seal the win.[52] Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, to the head of the Uruguayan Football Association, Ra~l Jude.[55] The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay;[51] in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate.[56] Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance, Yugoslavia and the United States all played friendlies in South America following the competition. Brazil played France on 1 August, Yugoslavia on 10 August and the United States on 17 August,[58] while Argentina hosted Yugoslavia on 3 August.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nUruguay's aggregate goal difference of +12 over four games, at an average of +3 per match, remains the highest average goal difference per match of any World Cup champion, and the second highest of any World Cup Finals participant, after Hungary in 1954.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith eight goals, Guillermo Stbile was the top scorer in the tournament. In total, 70 goals were scored by 36 players, with only one of them credited as an own goal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, FIFA published a report that ranked all teams in each World Cup up to and including 1986, based on progress in the competition, overall results and quality of the opposition.[45][13] The rankings for the 1930 tournament were as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last surviving player from Uruguay's World Cup-winning side was Ernesto Mascheroni, who died on 3 July 1984 at the age of 76. He was outlived by reserve defender Emilio Recoba who died on 12 September 1992 (aged 87), but did not play any matches in the tournament. However, many other players who participated in the tournament were still alive by this stage and the last surviving player from the tournament was Argentina's Francisco Varallo, who died on 30 August 2010 at the age of 100 ÿ eighty years after the tournament.[69] Lucien Laurent, the scorer of the first ever World Cup Goal was the last surviving Member of the France Squad and was invited in 1998 Final seeing France lifting its first ever World Cup win also as the only France member. He died in 2005 at the age of 97.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recreation of the tournament from the point of view of the Yugoslavian team can be seen in the 2014 Serbian film See You in Montevideo.","input":"When was the first world cup football tournament held?"},{"output":"is a sovereign Arab state in Western Asia constituting the","context":"","input":"What part of the world is saudi arabia located?"},{"output":"Todd Robert Bowles","context":"Todd Robert Bowles (born November 18, 1963) is an American football head coach for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL).

He was the interim head coach for the Miami Dolphins for the final three games of the 2011 season with a 2-1 record after the firing of Tony Sparano.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBowles attended Elizabeth High School in Elizabeth, New Jersey.[1] He played college football at Temple University for current Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians.\\r\\nBowles was signed by the Washington Redskins as an undrafted free agent on May 7, 1986.[2] He chose the Redskins over six other NFL teams, and signed a contract that included a signing bonus between $8,000 and $10,000. Bowles competed in training camp with free safety Raphel Cherry, and beat him out to earn a spot on the regular season roster.[3] In his second training camp in 1987, Bowles beat out Curtis Jordan for the starting free safety job when Jordan was released during final roster cuts on September 8, 1987.[4]\\r\\nOn February 1, 1989, after his contract expired, Bowles was left unprotected by the Redskins during \\"Plan B\\" free agency, despite being a regular starter at free safety the previous two seasons.[5] This was reportedly due to his poor catching abilities in 1988, as well as his lack of playmaking ability. He negotiated contracts with the Dallas Cowboys, Minnesota Vikings, and New York Giants,[6] but ultimately re-signed with the Redskins.[7] In 1990, Bowles received a salary of $300,000,[8] and started 18 games (including playoffs).[9]\\r\\nThe San Francisco 49ers signed Bowles to start for the team in 1991 after being left unprotected by the Redskins again.[10] He played in all 16 games and started in 14 of them.

The dramatic view of the bridge, the harbour, and the nearby Sydney Opera House is an iconic image of Sydney, and Australia itself. The bridge is nicknamed \\"The Coathanger\\" because of its arch-based design.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the direction of Dr John Bradfield of the NSW Department of Public Works, the bridge was designed and built by British firm Dorman Long and Co Ltd of Middlesbrough and opened in 1932.[4][5] The bridge's design was influenced by the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City.[6] It is the sixth longest spanning-arch bridge in the world and the tallest steel arch bridge, measuring 134?m (440?ft) from top to water level.[7] It was also the world's widest long-span bridge, at 48.8?m (160?ft) wide, until construction of the new Port Mann Bridge in Vancouver was completed in 2012.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe southern end of the bridge is located at Dawes Point in The Rocks area, and the northern end at Milsons Point in the lower North Shore area. There are six original lanes of road traffic through the main roadway, plus an additional two lanes of road traffic on its eastern side, using lanes that were formerly tram tracks. Adjacent to the road traffic, a path for pedestrian use runs along the eastern side of the bridge, whilst a dedicated path for bicycle use only runs along the western side; between the main roadway and the western bicycle path are two lanes used for railway tracks, servicing the T1 North Shore Line for Sydney Trains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main roadway across the bridge is known as the Bradfield Highway and is about 2.4?km (1.5?mi) long, making it one of the shortest highways in Australia.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arch is composed of two 28-panel arch trusses; their heights vary from 18?m (59?ft) at the centre of the arch to 57?m (187?ft) at the ends next to the pylons.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arch has a span of 504?m (1,654?ft) and its summit is 134?m (440?ft) above mean sea level; expansion of the steel structure on hot days can increase the height of the arch by  18?cm (7.1?in).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total weight of the steelwork of the bridge, including the arch and approach spans, is 52,800 tonnes (52,000 long tons; 58,200 short tons), with the arch itself weighing 39,000 tonnes (38,000 long tons; 43,000 short tons).[12] About 79% of the steel was imported from England, with the rest being sourced from Newcastle.[13] On site, the contractors (Dorman Long and Co.) set up two workshops at Milsons Point, at the site of the present day Luna Park, and fabricated the steel into the girders and other required parts.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge is held together by six million Australian-made hand-driven rivets supplied by the McPherson company of Melbourne,[14][15] the last being driven through the deck on 21 January 1932.[13][16] The rivets were heated red-hot and inserted into the plates; the headless end was immediately rounded over with a large pneumatic rivet gun.[17] The largest of the rivets used weighed 3.5?kg (8?lb) and was 39.5?cm (15.6?in) long.[12][18] The practice of riveting large steel structures, rather than welding, was, at the time, a proven and understood construction technique, whilst structural welding had not at that stage been adequately developed for use on the bridge.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt each end of the arch stands a pair of 89?m (292?ft) high concrete pylons, faced with granite.[19] The pylons were designed by the Scottish architect Thomas S. Tait,[20] a partner in the architectural firm John Burnet & Partners.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome 250 Australian, Scottish, and Italian stonemasons and their families relocated to a temporary settlement at Moruya, NSW, 300?km (186?mi) south of Sydney, where they quarried around 18,000?m3 (635,664?cu?ft) of granite for the bridge pylons.[13] The stonemasons cut, dressed, and numbered the blocks, which were then transported to Sydney on three ships built specifically for this purpose. The Moruya quarry was managed by John Gilmore, a Scottish stonemason who emigrated, with his young family to Australia in 1924, at the request of the project managers.[13][22][23] The concrete used was also Australian-made and supplied from Railton, Tasmania.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbutments at the base of the pylons are essential to support the loads from the arch and hold its span firmly in place, but the pylons themselves have no structural purpose. They were included to provide a frame for the arch panels and to give better visual balance to the bridge. The pylons were not part of the original design, and were only added to allay public concern about the structural integrity of the bridge.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough originally added to the bridge solely for their aesthetic value, all four pylons have now been put to use. The south-eastern pylon contains a museum and tourist centre, with a 360 lookout at the top providing views across the harbour and city. The south-western pylon is used by the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) to support its CCTV cameras overlooking the bridge and the roads around that area. The two pylons on the north shore include venting chimneys for fumes from the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, with the base of the southern pylon containing the RMS maintenance shed for the bridge, and the base of the northern pylon containing the traffic management shed for tow trucks and safety vehicles used on the bridge.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1942 the pylons were modified to include parapets and anti-aircraft guns designed to assist in both Australia's defence and general war effort.[26]The top level of stonework was never removed.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been plans to build a bridge as early as 1815, when convict and noted architect Francis Greenway reputedly proposed to Governor Lachlan Macquarie that a bridge be built from the northern to the southern shore of the harbour.[7][27] In 1825, Greenway wrote a letter to the then \\"The Australian\\" newspaper stating that such a bridge would \\"give an idea of strength and magnificence that would reflect credit and glory on the colony and the Mother Country\\".[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing came of Greenway's suggestions, but the idea remained alive, and many further suggestions were made during the nineteenth century. In 1840, naval architect Robert Brindley proposed that a floating bridge be built. Engineer Peter Henderson produced one of the earliest known drawings of a bridge across the harbour around 1857. A suggestion for a truss bridge was made in 1879, and in 1880 a high-level bridge estimated at $850,000 was proposed.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1900, the Lyne government committed to building a new Central railway station and organised a worldwide competition for the design and construction of a harbour bridge. Local engineer Norman Selfe submitted a design for a suspension bridge and won the second prize of S500. In 1902, when the outcome of the first competition became mired in controversy, Selfe won a second competition outright, with a design for a steel cantilever bridge. The selection board were unanimous, commenting that, \\"The structural lines are correct and in true proportion, and... the outline is graceful\\".[28] However due to an economic downturn and a change of government at the 1904 NSW State election construction never began.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA unique three-span bridge was proposed in 1922 by Ernest Stowe with connections at Balls Head, Millers Point, and Balmain with a memorial tower and hub on Goat Island.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1914 John Bradfield was appointed \\"Chief Engineer of Sydney Harbour Bridge and Metropolitan Railway Construction\\", and his work on the project over many years earned him the legacy as the \\"father\\" of the bridge.[4] Bradfield's preference at the time was for a cantilever bridge without piers, and in 1916 the NSW Legislative Assembly passed a bill for such a construction, however it did not proceed as the Legislative Council rejected the legislation on the basis that the money would be better spent on the war effort.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing World War I, plans to build the bridge again built momentum.[7] Bradfield persevered with the project, fleshing out the details of the specifications and financing for his cantilever bridge proposal, and in 1921 he travelled overseas to investigate tenders. On return from his travels Bradfield decided that an arch design would also be suitable[27] and he and officers of the NSW Department of Public Works prepared a general design[4][7] for a single-arch bridge based upon New York City's Hell Gate Bridge.[6][31] In 1922 the government passed the Sydney Harbour Bridge Act No. 28, specifying the construction of a high-level cantilever or arch bridge across the harbour between Dawes Point and Milsons Point, along with construction of necessary approaches and electric railway lines,[27] and worldwide tenders were invited for the project.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the tendering process, the government received twenty proposals from six companies; on 24 March 1924 the contract was awarded to British firm Dorman Long and Co Ltd, of Middlesbrough well known as the contractors who built the similar Tyne Bridge of Newcastle Upon Tyne, for an arch bridge at a quoted price of AUS4,217,721 11s 10d.[4][27] The arch design was cheaper than alternative cantilever and suspension bridge proposals, and also provided greater rigidity making it better suited for the heavy loads expected.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nBradfield and his staff were ultimately to oversee the entire bridge design and building process, while Dorman Long and Co's Consulting Engineer, Sir Ralph Freeman of Sir Douglas Fox and Partners, and his associate Mr. G.C. Imbault, carried out the detailed design and erection process of the bridge.[4] Architects for the contractors were from the British firm John Burnet & Partners of Glasgow, Scotland.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building of the bridge coincided with the construction of a system of underground railways in Sydney's CBD, known today as the City Circle, and the bridge was designed with this in mind. The bridge was designed to carry six lanes of road traffic, flanked on each side by two railway tracks and a footpath. Both sets of rail tracks were linked into the underground Wynyard railway station on the south (city) side of the bridge by symmetrical ramps and tunnels. The eastern-side railway tracks were intended for use by a planned rail link to the Northern Beaches;[citation needed] in the interim they were used to carry trams from the North Shore into a terminal within Wynyard station, and when tram services were discontinued in 1958, they were converted into extra traffic lanes. The Bradfield Highway, which is the main roadway section of the bridge and its approaches, is named in honour of Bradfield's contribution to the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building of the bridge was under the management of Bradfield. Three other people heavily involved in the bridge's design and construction were Lawrence Ennis, Edward Judge, and Sir Ralph Freeman. Ennis was the engineer-in-charge at Dorman Long and Co and the main on-site supervisor (Bradfield visited occasionally throughout the project and, in particular, at many key stages of the project, to inspect progress and make managerial decisions), Judge was chief technical engineer of Dorman Long, and Freeman was hired by the company to design the accepted model in further detail. Later a bitter disagreement broke out between Bradfield and Freeman as to who actually designed the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official ceremony to mark the \\"turning of the first sod\\" occurred on 28 July 1923, on the spot at Milsons Point on the north shore where two workshops to assist in building the bridge were to be constructed.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn estimated 469 buildings on the north shore, both private homes and commercial operations, were demolished to allow construction to proceed, with little or no compensation being paid. Work on the bridge itself commenced with the construction of approaches and approach spans, and by September 1926 concrete piers to support the approach spans were in place on each side of the harbour.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs construction of the approaches took place, work was also started on preparing the foundations required to support the enormous weight of the arch and loadings. Concrete and granite faced abutment towers were constructed, with the angled foundations built into their sides.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce work had progressed sufficiently on the support structures, a giant \\"creeper crane\\" was erected on each side of the harbour.[33] These cranes were fitted with a cradle, and then used to hoist men and materials into position to allow for erection of the steelwork. To stabilise works while building the arches, tunnels were excavated on each shore with steel cables passed through them and then fixed to the upper sections of each half-arch to stop them collapsing as they extended outwards.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nArch construction itself began on 26 October 1928. The southern end of the bridge was worked on ahead of the northern end, to detect any errors and to help with alignment. The cranes would \\"creep\\" along the arches as they were constructed, eventually meeting up in the middle. In less than two years, on Tuesday, 19 August 1930, the two halves of the arch touched for the first time. Workers riveted both top and bottom sections of the arch together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the support cables to be removed. On 20 August 1930 the joining of the arches was celebrated by flying the flags of Australia and the United Kingdom from the jibs of the creeper cranes.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the arch was completed, the creeper cranes were then worked back down the arches, allowing the roadway and other parts of the bridge to be constructed from the centre out. The vertical hangers were attached to the arch, and these were then joined with horizontal crossbeams. The deck for the roadway and railway were built on top of the crossbeams, with the deck itself being completed by June 1931, and the creeper cranes were dismantled. Rails for trains and trams were laid, and road was surfaced using concrete topped with asphalt.[32] Power and telephone lines, and water, gas, and drainage pipes were also all added to the bridge in 1931.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pylons were built atop the abutment towers, with construction advancing rapidly from July 1931. Carpenters built wooden scaffolding, with concreters and masons then setting the masonry and pouring the concrete behind it. Gangers built the steelwork in the towers, while day labourers manually cleaned the granite with wire brushes. The last stone of the north-west pylon was set in place on 15 January 1932, and the timber towers used to support the cranes were removed.[19][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 January 1932, the first test train, a steam locomotive, safely crossed the bridge.[34] Load testing of the bridge took place in February 1932, with the four rail tracks being loaded with as many as 96 steam locomotives positioned end-to-end. The bridge underwent testing for three weeks, after which it was declared safe and ready to be opened.[32] The construction worksheds were demolished after the bridge was completed, and the land that they were on is now occupied by Luna Park.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standards of industrial safety during construction were poor by today's standards. Sixteen workers died during construction,[36] but surprisingly only two from falling off the bridge. Several more were injured from unsafe working practices undertaken whilst heating and inserting its rivets, and the deafness experienced by many of the workers in later years was blamed on the project. Henri Mallard between 1930 and 1932 produced hundreds of stills[37] and film footage[38] which reveal at close quarters the bravery of the workers in tough Depression-era conditions.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nInterviews were conducted between 1982-1989 with a variety of tradesmen who worked on the building of the bridge. Among the tradesmen interviewed were drillers, riveters, concrete packers, boilermakers, riggers, ironworkers, plasterers, stonemasons, an official photographer, sleepcutters, engineers and draughtsmen.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total financial cost of the bridge was AUS6.25 million, which was not paid off in full until 1988.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge was formally opened on Saturday, 19 March 1932.[41] Amongst those who attended and gave speeches were the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Philip Game, and the Minister for Public Works, Lawrence Ennis. The Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, was to open the bridge by cutting a ribbon at its southern end.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, just as Lang was about to cut the ribbon, a man in military uniform rode up on a horse, slashing the ribbon with his sword and opening the Sydney Harbour Bridge in the name of the people of New South Wales before the official ceremony began. He was promptly arrested.[42] The ribbon was hurriedly retied and Lang performed the official opening ceremony and Game thereafter inaugurated the name of the bridge as 'Sydney Harbour Bridge' and the associated roadway as the 'Bradfield Highway'. After they did so, there was a 21-gun salute and an RAAF flypast. The intruder was identified as Francis de Groot. He was convicted of offensive behaviour and fined S5 after a psychiatric test proved he was sane, but this verdict was reversed on appeal. De Groot then successfully sued the Commissioner of Police for wrongful arrest, and was awarded an undisclosed out of court settlement. De Groot was a member of a right-wing paramilitary group called the New Guard, opposed to Lang's leftist policies and resentful of the fact that a member of the Royal Family had not been asked to open the bridge.[42] De Groot was not a member of the regular army but his uniform allowed him to blend in with the real cavalry. This incident was one of several involving Lang and the New Guard during that year.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA similar ribbon-cutting ceremony on the bridge's northern side by North Sydney's mayor, Alderman Primrose, was carried out without incident. It was later discovered that Primrose was also a New Guard member but his role in and knowledge of the de Groot incident, if any, are unclear.[citation needed] The pair of golden scissors used in the ribbon cutting ceremonies on both sides of the bridge was also used to cut the ribbon at the dedication of the Bayonne Bridge, which had opened in Bayonne, New Jersey, close to New York City, the year before.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the bridge opening in the midst of the Great Depression, opening celebrations were organised by the Citizens of Sydney Organising Committee, an influential body of prominent men and politicians that formed in 1931 under the chairmanship of the Lord Mayor to oversee the festivities. The celebrations included an array of decorated floats, a procession of passenger ships sailing below the bridge, and a Venetian Carnival.[45] A message from a primary school in Tottenham, 515?km (320?mi) away in rural New South Wales, arrived at the bridge on the day and was presented at the opening ceremony. It had been carried all the way from Tottenham to the bridge by relays of school children, with the final relay being run by two children from the nearby Fort Street Boys' and Girls' schools. \\r\\nAfter the official ceremonies, the public was allowed to walk across the bridge on the deck, something that would not be repeated until the 50th anniversary celebrations.[27] Estimates suggest that between 300,000 and one million people took part in the opening festivities,[27] a phenomenal number given that the entire population of Sydney at the time was estimated to be 1,256,000.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had also been numerous preparatory arrangements. On 14 March 1932, three postage stamps were issued to commemorate the imminent opening of the bridge. Several songs were composed for the occasion.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge itself was regarded as a triumph over Depression times, earning the nickname \\"the Iron Lung\\", as it kept many Depression-era workers employed.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the average daily traffic included 204 trains, 160,435 vehicles and 1650 bicycles.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the Sydney CBD side, motor vehicle access to the bridge is normally via Grosvenor Street, Clarence Street, Kent Street, the Cahill Expressway, or the Western Distributor. Drivers on the northern side will find themselves on the Warringah Freeway, though it is easy to turn off the freeway to drive westwards into North Sydney or eastwards to Neutral Bay and beyond upon arrival on the northern side.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge originally only had four wider traffic lanes occupying the central space which now has six, as photos taken soon after the opening clearly show. In 1958 tram services across the bridge were withdrawn and the tracks replaced by two extra road lanes; these lanes are now the leftmost southbound lanes on the bridge and are still clearly distinguishable from the other six road lanes. Lanes 7 and 8 now connect the bridge to the elevated Cahill Expressway that carries traffic to the Eastern Distributor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, work began to build a tunnel to complement the bridge. It was determined that the bridge could no longer support the increased traffic flow of the 1980s. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel was completed in August 1992 and carries only motor vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bradfield Highway is designated as a Travelling Stock Route[50] which means that it is permissible to herd livestock across the bridge, but only between midnight and dawn, and after giving notice of intention to do so. In practice, owing to the high-density urban nature of modern Sydney, and the relocation of abattoirs and markets, this has not taken place for approximately half a century.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge is equipped for tidal flow operation, permitting the direction of traffic flow on the bridge to be altered to better suit the morning and evening rush hours' traffic patterns.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge has eight lanes in total, numbered one to eight from west to east. Lanes three, four and five are reversible. One and two always flow north. Six, seven, and eight always flow south. The default is four each way. For the morning rush hour, the lane changes on the bridge also require changes to the Warringah Freeway, with its inner western reversible carriageway directing traffic to the bridge lane numbers three and four southbound.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge has a series of overhead gantries which indicate the direction of flow for each traffic lane. A green arrow pointing down to a traffic lane means the lane is open. A flashing red \\"X\\" indicates the lane is closing, but is not yet in use for traffic travelling in the other direction. A static red \\"X\\" means the lane is in use for oncoming traffic. This arrangement was introduced in the 1990s, replacing a slow operation where lane markers were manually moved to mark the centre median.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible to see odd arrangements of flow during night periods when maintenance occurs, which may involve completely closing some lanes. Normally this is done between midnight and dawn, because of the enormous traffic demands placed on the bridge outside these hours.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vehicular traffic lanes on the bridge are operated as a toll road. As of 27 January 2009 there is a variable tolling system for all vehicles headed into the CBD (southbound). The toll paid is dependent on the time of day in which the vehicle passes through the toll plaza. The toll varies from a minimum value of $2.50 to a maximum value of $4.[52] There is no toll for northbound traffic (though taxis travelling north may charge passengers the toll in anticipation of the toll the taxi must pay on the return journey). There are toll plazas at the northern and southern ends. The two eastern lanes (which continue over the Cahill Expressway at the southern end of the bridge) have their tollbooths at the northern end, while the other southbound lanes (for CBD traffic) are serviced by tollbooths at the southern end of the bridge. There is a bridge-long median strip between lanes 6 and 7 to separate traffic which has already paid the toll (at the northern end) from other southbound traffic (which must pay the toll at the southern end).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe toll was originally placed on travel across the bridge, in both directions, to recoup the cost of its construction. This cost was recovered in the 1980s, but the toll has been kept (indeed increased) by the state government's Roads and Traffic Authority to recoup the costs of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the decision to build the Sydney Harbour Tunnel was made in the early 1980s, the toll was increased (from 20 cents to $1, then to $1.50, and finally to $2 by the time the tunnel opened) to pay for its construction. The tunnel also had an initial toll of $2 southbound. After the increase to $1, the concrete barrier on the bridge separating the Bradfield Highway from the Cahill Expressway was increased in height, because of the large numbers of drivers crossing it illegally from lane 6 to 7, to avoid the toll. The toll for all southbound vehicles was increased to $3 in March 2004.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally it cost a car or motorcycle six pence to cross, a horse and rider being three pence. Use of the bridge by bicycle riders (provided that they use the cycleway) and by pedestrians is free. Later governments capped the fee for motorcycles at one-quarter of the passenger-vehicle cost, but now it is again the same as the cost for a passenger vehicle, although quarterly flat-fee passes are available which are much cheaper for frequent users.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2008 a new electronic tolling system called e-TAG was introduced. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel was converted to this new tolling system while the Sydney Harbour Bridge itself had several cash lanes. The electronic system as of 12 January 2009 has now replaced all booths with E-tag lanes.[54] In January 2017 work commenced to remove the southern toll booths.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pedestrian-only footway is located on the east side of the bridge. Access from the northern side involves climbing an easily spotted flight of stairs, located on the east side of the bridge at Broughton St, Kirribilli. Pedestrian access on the southern side is more complicated, but signposts in the Rocks area now direct pedestrians to the long and sheltered flight of stairs that leads to the bridge's southern end. These stairs are located near Gloucester Street and Cumberland Street.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge can also be approached from the south by accessing Cahill Walk, which runs along the Cahill Expressway. Pedestrians can access this walkway from the east end of Circular Quay by a flight of stairs or a lift. Alternatively it can be accessed from the Botanic Gardens.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bike-only cycleway is located on the western side of the bridge. Access from the northern side involves carrying or pushing a bicycle up a staircase, consisting of 55 steps, located on the western side of the bridge at Burton St, Milsons Point. A wide smooth concrete strip in the centre of the stairs permits cycles to be wheeled up and down from the bridge deck whilst the rider is dismounted. A campaign to eliminate the steps on this popular cycling route to the CBD has been running since at least 2008.[56][57] On 7 December 2016 the NSW Roads Minister Duncan Gay confirmed that the northern stairway would be replaced with a A$20 million ramp alleviating the needs for cyclists to dismount. At the same time the NSW Government announced plans to upgrade the southern ramp at a projected cost of A$20 million. Both projects are expected to completed by late 2020.[58][59][60] Access to the cycleway on the southern side is via the northern end of the Kent Street cycleway and/or Upper Fort Street in The Rocks.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge lies between Milsons Point and Wynyard railway stations, located on the north and south shores respectively, with two tracks running along the western side of the bridge. These tracks are part of the North Shore railway line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1958 tram services across the bridge were withdrawn and the tracks they had used were removed and replaced by two extra road lanes; these lanes are now the leftmost southbound lanes on the bridge and are still clearly distinguishable from the other six road lanes. The original ramp that took the trams into their terminus at the underground Wynyard railway station is still visible at the southern end of the main walkway under lanes 7 and 8, although the tunnels have been converted into a car park and firing range.[62][citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sydney Harbour Bridge requires constant inspections and other maintenance work to keep it safe for the public, and to protect from corrosion. Among the trades employed on the bridge are painters, ironworkers, boilermakers, fitters, electricians, plasterers, carpenters, plumbers, and riggers.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most noticeable maintenance work on the bridge involves painting. The steelwork of the bridge that needs to be painted is a combined 485,000?m2 (120 acres), the equivalent of sixty football fields. Each coat on the bridge requires some 30,000?L (6,600?imp?gal) of paint.[31] A special fast-drying paint is used, so that any paint drops have dried before reaching the vehicles or bridge surface.[18] One notable identity from previous bridge-painting crews is Australian comedian and actor Paul Hogan, who worked as a bridge painter before rising to media fame in the 1970s.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003 the Roads & Traffic Authority began completely repainting the southern approach spans of the bridge. This involved removing the old lead-based paint, and repainting the 90,000?m2 (22 acres) of steel below the deck. Workers operated from self-contained platforms below the deck, with each platform having an air extraction system to filter airborne particles. An abrasive blasting was used, with the lead waste collected and safely removed from the site for disposal.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween December 2006 and March 2010 the bridge was subject to works designed to ensure its longevity. The work included some strengthening.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2013, two grit-blasting robots specially developed with the University of Technology, Sydney have been employed to help with the paint stripping operation on the bridge.[64] The robots, nicknamed Rosie and Sandy,[65] are intended to reduce workers' potential exposure to dangerous lead paint and asbestos and the blasting equipment which has enough force to cut through clothes and skin.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven during its construction, the bridge was such a prominent feature of Sydney that it would attract tourist interest. One of the ongoing tourist attractions of the bridge has been the south-east pylon, which is accessed via the pedestrian walkway across the bridge, and then a climb to the top of the pylon of about 200 steps.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long after the bridge's opening, commencing in 1934, Archer Whitford first converted this pylon into a tourist destination.[67] He installed a number of attractions, including a caf, a camera obscura, an Aboriginal museum, a \\"Mother's Nook\\" where visitors could write letters, and a \\"pashometer\\". The main attraction was the viewing platform, where \\"charming attendants\\" assisted visitors to use the telescopes available,[67] and a copper cladding (still present) over the granite guard rails identified the suburbs and landmarks of Sydney at the time.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outbreak of World War II in 1939 saw tourist activities on the bridge cease, as the military took over the four pylons and modified them to include parapets and anti-aircraft guns.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1948 Yvonne Rentoul opened the \\"All Australian Exhibition\\" in the pylon. This contained dioramas, and displays about Australian perspectives on subjects such as farming, sport, transport, mining, and the armed forces. An orientation table was installed at the viewing platform, along with a wall guide and binoculars. The owner kept several white cats in a rooftop cattery, which also served as an attraction, and there was a souvenir shop and postal outlet.[70] Rentoul's lease expired in 1971, and the pylon and its lookout remained closed to the public for over a decade.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pylon was reopened in 1982, with a new exhibition celebrating the bridge's 50th anniversary.[72] In 1987 a \\"Bicentennial Exhibition\\" was opened to mark the 200th anniversary of European settlement in Australia in 1988.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pylon was closed from April to November 2000 for the Roads & Traffic Authority and BridgeClimb to create a new exhibition called \\"Proud Arch\\". The exhibition focussed on Bradfield, and included a glass direction finder on the observation level, and various important heritage items.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pylon again closed for four weeks in 2003 for the installation of an exhibit called \\"Dangerous Works\\", highlighting the dangerous conditions experienced by the original construction workers on the bridge, and two stained glass feature windows in memory of the workers.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1950s and 1960s there were occasional newspaper reports of climbers who had made illegal arch traversals of the bridge, invariably by night. In 1973 Philippe Petit walked across a wire between the two pylons at the southern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Since 1998, BridgeClimb[76] has made it possible for tourists to legally climb the southern half of the bridge. Tours run throughout the day, from dawn to night, and are only cancelled for electrical storms or high wind.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nGroups of climbers are provided with protective clothing appropriate to the prevailing weather conditions, and are given an orientation briefing before climbing. During the climb, attendees are secured to the bridge by a wire lifeline. Each climb begins on the eastern side of the bridge and ascends to the top. At the summit, the group crosses to the western side of the arch for the descent. Each climb takes three-and-a-half-hours, including the preparations.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2006, BridgeClimb[76] launched an alternative to climbing the upper arches of the bridge. The Discovery Climb allows climbers to ascend the lower chord of the bridge and view its internal structure. From the apex of the lower chord, climbers ascend a staircase to a platform at the summit.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the opening, the bridge has been the focal point of much tourism and national pride.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982 the bridge celebrated the 50th anniversary of its opening. For the first time since its opening in 1932, the bridge was closed to most vehicles with the exception of vintage vehicles, and pedestrians were allowed full access for the day.[13] The celebrations were attended by Edward Judge, who represented Dorman Long.[citation needed] [78]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia's bicentennial celebrations on 26 January 1988 attracted large crowds in the bridge's vicinity as merrymakers flocked to the foreshores to view the events on the harbour. The highlight was the biggest parade of sail ever held in Sydney, square-riggers from all over the world, surrounded by hundreds of smaller craft of every description, passing majestically under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The day's festivities culminated in a fireworks display in which the bridge was the focal point of the finale, with fireworks streaming from the arch and roadway. This was to become the pattern for later firework displays.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Harbour Bridge is an integral part of the Sydney New Year's Eve celebrations, generally being used in spectacular ways during the fireworks displays at 21:00 and midnight. In recent times, the bridge has included a ropelight display on a framework in the centre of the eastern arch, which is used to complement the fireworks. As the scaffolding and framework are clearly visible for some weeks before the event, revealing the outline of the design, there is much speculation as to how the effect is to be realised.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the millennium celebrations in 2000, the Sydney Harbour Bridge was lit up with the word \\"Eternity\\", as a tribute to the legacy of Arthur Stace a Sydney artist who for many years inscribed that word on pavements in chalk in beautiful copperplate writing despite the fact that he was illiterate.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effects have been as follows:[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe numbers for the New Year's Eve countdown also appear on the eastern side of the Bridge pylons.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2000 the bridge was closed to vehicular access for a day to allow a special reconciliation marchthe \\"Walk for Reconciliation\\"to take place. This was part of a response to an Aboriginal Stolen Generations inquiry, which found widespread suffering had taken place amongst Australian Aboriginal children forcibly placed into the care of white parents in a little-publicised state government scheme. Between 200,000 and 300,000 people were estimated to have walked the bridge in a symbolic gesture of crossing a divide.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Sydney 2000 Olympics in September and October 2000, the bridge was adorned with the Olympic Rings. It was included in the Olympic torch's route to the Olympic stadium. The men's and women's Olympic marathon events likewise included the bridge as part of their route to the Olympic stadium. A fireworks display at the end of the closing ceremony ended at the bridge. The east-facing side of the bridge has been used several times since as a framework from which to hang static fireworks, especially during the elaborate New Year's Eve displays.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005 Mark Webber drove a Williams-BMW Formula One car across the bridge.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the 75th anniversary of its opening was commemorated with an exhibition at the Museum of Sydney, called \\"Bridging Sydney\\".[84] An initiative of the Historic Houses Trust, the exhibition featured dramatic photographs and paintings with rare and previously unseen alternative bridge and tunnel proposals, plans and sketches.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 March 2007, the Sydney Harbour Bridge celebrated its 75th anniversary. The occasion was marked with a ribbon-cutting ceremony by the governor, Marie Bashir and the premier of New South Wales, Morris Iemma. The bridge was subsequently open to the public to walk southward from Milsons Point or North Sydney. Several major roads, mainly in the CBD, were closed for the day. An Aboriginal smoking ceremony was held at 19:00.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 250,000 people (50,000 more than were registered) took part in the event. Bright yellow souvenir caps were distributed to walkers. A series of speakers placed at intervals along the bridge formed a sound installation. Each group of speakers broadcast sound and music from a particular era (e.g. King Edward VIII's abdication speech; Gough Whitlam's speech at Parliament House in 1975), the overall effect being that the soundscape would \\"flow\\" through history as walkers proceeded along the bridge. A light-show began after sunset and continued late into the night, the bridge being bathed in constantly changing, multi-coloured lighting, designed to highlight structural features of the bridge. In the evening the bright yellow caps were replaced by orange caps with a small, bright LED attached. The bridge was closed to walkers at about 20:30.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 October 2009 turf was laid across the eight lanes of bitumen, and 6,000 people celebrated a picnic on the bridge accompanied by live music.[85] The event was repeated in 2010.[86] Although originally scheduled again in 2011, this event was moved to Bondi Beach due to traffic concerns about the prolonged closing of the bridge.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 March 2012 the 80th anniversary of the Sydney Harbour Bridge was celebrated with a picnic dedicated to the stories of people with personal connections to the bridge.[89] In addition, Google dedicated its Google Doodle on the 19th to the event.[90]\\r\\nThe proposal to upgrade the bridge tolling equipment was announced by the NSW Roads Minister Duncan Gay.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere the proud arch Colossus like bestrideYon glittering streams and bound the strafing tide.\\r\\nI open this bridge in the name of His Majesty the King and all the decent citizens of NSW.\\r\\nTo get on in Australia, you must make two observations.

No Australian will admit this.\\r\\n...in a gesture of anomalous exhilaration, at the worst time of the depression Sydney opened its Harbour Bridge, one of the talismanic structures of the earth, and by far the most striking thing ever built in Australia.

It has a narrow cylindrical shape. Each marked line on the graduated cylinder represents the amount of liquid that has been measured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge graduated cylinders are usually made up of polypropylene for its excellent chemical resistance or polymethylpentene for its transparency, making them lighter and less fragile than glass. Polypropylene (PP) is easy to repeatedly autoclave; however, autoclaving in excess of about 121?C (250?F) (depending on the chemical formulation: typical commercial grade polypropylene melts in excess of 177?C (351?F)), can warp or damage polypropylene graduated cylinders, affecting accuracy.[1]\\r\\nI H N traditional graduated cylinder (A in the image) is usually narrow and tall so as to increase the accuracy and precision of volume measurement; it has a plastic or glass bottom and a \\"spout\\" for easy pouring of the measured liquid. An additional version is wide and low.\\r\\nMixing cylinders (B in the picture) have ground glass joints instead of a spout, so they can be closed with a stopper or connect directly with other elements of a manifold.[2] With this kind of cylinder, the metered liquid does not pour directly, but is often removed using a cannula. A graduated cylinder is meant to be read with the surface of the liquid at eye level, where the center of the meniscus shows the measurement line. Typical capacities of graduated cylinders are from 10 mL to 1000 mL.\\r\\nGraduated cylinders are often used to measure the volume of a liquid. Graduated cylinders are generally more accurate and precise than laboratory flasks and beakers, but they should not be used to perform volumetric analysis;[3] volumetric glassware, such as a volumetric flask or volumetric pipette, should be used, as it is even more accurate and precise. Graduated cylinders are sometimes used to measure the volume of a solid indirectly by measuring the displacement of a liquid.\\r\\nFor accuracy the volume on graduated cylinders is depicted on scales with 3 significant digits: 100mL cylinders have 1ml grading divisions while 10mL cylinders have 0.1 mL grading divisions.\\r\\nTwo classes of accuracy exist for graduated cylinders. Class A has double the accuracy of class B.[4] Cylinders can have single or double scales. Single scales allow to read the volume from top to bottom (filling volume) while double scale cylinders allow reading for filling and pouring (reverse scale).\\r\\nGraduated cylinders are calibrated either to contain (indicated liquid volume inside the cylinder) and marked as \\"TC\\" or to deliver (indicated liquid volume poured out, accounting for liquid traces left in the cylinder) and marked TD.[5] Formerly the tolerances for to deliver and to contain cylinders are distinct; however now these are the same. Also, the international symbols IN and EX are more likely to be used instead of TC and TD respectively.[6]\\r\\nTo read the volume accurately, the observation must be at an eye level and read at the bottom of a meniscus of the liquid level.[7] For example, in the picture on the bottom of the page, a 100mL graduated cylinder was used to measure the liquid. The cylinder contains 60mL liquid volume. The main reason as to why the reading of the volume is done via meniscus is due to the nature of the liquid in a closed surrounded space. By nature, liquid in the cylinder would be attracted to the wall around it through molecular forces. This forces the liquid surface to develop either a convex or concave shape, depending on the type of the liquid in the cylinder. Reading the liquid at the bottom part of a concave or the top part of the convex liquid is equivalent to reading the liquid at its meniscus.[8] From the picture, the level of the liquid will be read at the bottom of the meniscus, which is the concave. The most accurate of the reading that could be done here is reduced down to 1 mL due to the given means of measurement on the cylinder. From this, the derived error would be one tenth of the least figure. For instance, if the reading is done and the value calculated is set to be 36.5 mL. The error, give or take 0.1 mL, must be included too. Therefore, the more precise value equates to 36.5 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\pm }\\r\\n\\r\\n 0.1; 36.4 or 36.6 mL. Therefore, there are 3 significant figures can be read from the given graduated cylinder picture.[9] Another example, if the reading is done and the value calculated is set to be 40.0 mL. The precise value would be 40.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\pm }\\r\\n\\r\\n 0.1; 40.1 or 39.9 mL.[10]\\r\\nTwo graduated cylinders.

The British Olympic Association had been working on the bid since 1997, and presented its report to government ministers in December 2000.\\r\\nFollowing three consecutive unsuccessful UK bids to host summer Olympic Games (Birmingham for 1992 and Manchester for 1996 and 2000), the decision was made to bid with London, given the clear indication that it was the only UK city that had a chance of being selected by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) when put up against other world cities in a competitive bidding process.[1] On 6 July 2005 at its 117th Session in Singapore, the IOC awarded London the right to host the Games of the XXX Olympiad. The city beat the favourite Paris 54 to 50 on the fourth and final ballot. London is the first city to host the Games three times.[2]\\r\\nAt the time of the bid, the budget projection was around S2?billion, but it was later estimated that the true cost would be around S9?billion.[3] The project involved a major regeneration of the Stratford area of London, as well as improvements to surrounding services and associated venues.[1] Public transport, an aspect of the proposal which scored poorly for the bid, saw numerous improvements, including to the London Underground and the new \\"Olympic Javelin\\" service.[4]\\r\\nThe celebrations of the bid's success were partly silenced the day after the announcement when the 7 July 2005 London bombings killed 52 people and injured hundreds more. There was no confirmed link between the IOC decision and the attack,[5] which also coincided with the G8 Summit in Scotland.\\r\\nFollowing the success of the bid, the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) was established to oversee the ongoing development of the games. Some alterations were made after the bid was accepted, including the decision by the IOC to eliminate some sporting events,[6] and a new layout for the Olympic Zone, both resulting in some relatively minor changes to the Olympic venues.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2012 Olympics were planned to use a mixture of newly built venues, existing facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade. In the wake of the problems that plagued the Millennium Dome, the intention was that there would be no white elephants after the games. Some of the new facilities would be reused in their Olympic form, while others would be reduced in size and several would be relocated elsewhere in the UK. The plans would contribute to the regeneration of Stratford in east London, which would be the site of the Olympic Park, and of the neighbouring Lower Lea Valley.[7]\\r\\nHowever, this required the compulsory purchase of some businesses and this caused controversy, with some of the business owners claiming that the compensation offered was inadequate. The purchased buildings were demolished to make way for Olympic venues and infrastructure improvements.\\r\\nThe majority of venues were divided into three zones within Greater London: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. Also some venues (such as those for sailing) were outside the boundaries of Greater London.[1]\\r\\nThe IOC noted that future negotiations were necessary to ensure the use of the Old Trafford and Villa Park football stadiums. The need for compulsory purchase orders was also highlighted as a possible problem for the Olympic Park, but IOC did not expect this to cause any \\"undue delay to construction schedules\\".[8]\\r\\nAt the time of the bid, 60% of the venues and facilities were in place. The remaining venues were proposed to be completed between 2007 and the start of the games. At time of the bid the following were the tentative completion dates for some of the remaining venues: Channel Tunnel/Stratford rail link (2007); Aquatics Centre and London Velopark (2008); East London line extension (2010); Olympic Stadium and Heathrow's Terminal Five final completion (2011).\\r\\nThe Olympic Zone encompasses all of the facilities within the 500-acre (2?km2) Olympic Park in Stratford. This park was developed on existing waste and industrial land, at grid reference TQ379849, just seven minutes by Olympic Javelin train from central London. The park contains:[9]\\r\\nThe River Zone featured five main venues in the Thames Gateway area straddling the River Thames:\\r\\nThe Central Zone was formed out of all the remaining venues within Greater London. They are quite widely spread across central and west London:\\r\\nThree of the venues were just outside Greater London:[20]\\r\\nThe Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy, in Portland Harbour, Dorset, on the south coast of England, would be used for the sailing events. It is around 120 miles (192?km) from central London.\\r\\nThe earlier stages of the football competition were played at football stadia around the country including:\\r\\nThe Olympic Village was located in Lower Lea Valley in east London. The area was then underdeveloped, and thus a well-suited place to construct the village.[21] Because the Olympic Village is located within the Olympic Park, about 75 percent of athletes would be within 15?minutes of their venues; this compact design, according to double Olympic decathlon gold medallist Daley Thompson, would \\"make [the experience] so much more inspirating [sic] and real\\". When the games are over, the Village will be converted into new homes and facilities for the local community.[22]\\r\\nAustralian construction company Lend Lease Corp Ltd was chosen to build the Olympic Village. The project cost S5.3?billion (A$13.2?billion)[23] and was constructed in two phases. The first phase, which involves the development of 4,200?residential buildings and other accommodations for the village, began in 2008. When the 2012 Olympics are over, the second phase will involve the refurbishment of the Olympic village and construction on another 500,000?m2 (5,400,000?sq?ft) of space to complete the regeneration of Stratford City.[24]\\r\\nThe Olympic Village's accommodations are the most spacious in Olympic history. Each athlete and official is guaranteed their own bed?ÿ over 17,000?beds in total. Each apartment was billed to include Internet access and wireless networking and other state-of-the-art technology.[25]\\r\\nPublic transport, an aspect of the bid which scored poorly in the IOC's initial evaluation,[26] was planned to see numerous improvements, including the expansion of the London Underground's East London Line, upgrades to the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, and the temporary \\"Olympic Javelin\\" service.[4] The games were won without a commitment to deliver Crossrail by 2012. This was the largest transport project proposed for London, and it was widely assumed in the early stages of the bidding process that the games could not be won without a guarantee that it would be completed before the games.\\r\\nThe bid envisaged that 80% of athletes would be within 20 minutes of their events and 97% would be within 30 minutes of their events. It was estimated that 80% of spectators would arrive by rail.[27] Together, all the planned heavy rail, light rail, and underground services (excluding Crossrail) were expected to deliver around 240 trains every hour.[28]\\r\\nAdditionally, there were to be two major park and ride sites off the M25 within 25 minutes of the Olympic Park capable of holding 12,000 cars. For the most part, predictions showed that on event days, 78% of spectators were likely to travel from within London and only 22% from the rest of the UK and Europe. Organizers hoped to use low- or no-emission vehicles to transport Olympic athletes and officials.[27]\\r\\nAs of the time of the bid, projections for the cost of the 2012 Olympics were low. The bid team believed that London could end the Games with a surplus of more than S100?million. The organising committee laid out the following figures:\\r\\nThe revenue for the games was also projected:\\r\\nWhile this projection seemed reasonable, many were adamant about the actual costs. In early 2007, it was suggested that the actual cost of the games could exceed S9.35?billion (US$18.03?billion), well over the bid projection. For comparison, the 2004 games in Athens cost around S7?billion (US$13.5?billion) and estimates for the 2008 games in Beijing run between S10?billion and S20?billion (US$19?billion and US$39?billion).[29]\\r\\nApproximately 8.0?million tickets were proposed to be available for the Olympics, and 1.5?million tickets for the Paralympics.[30][31] and the London Organising Committee planned on selling a total of 6.5?million (an 81% sellout) Olympic tickets, and a 63% sellout for Paralympic tickets.[32] Olympic tickets go on sale on 15 March 2011[33] and should remain on sale until the start of the event, depending on availability. With the purchase of a ticket, each person is entitled to free transportation on London's public transport system for that day.[30] Paralympic tickets go on sale on 9 September 2011.[34]\\r\\nMarketing Director David Magliano said that 1.5?million tickets would be sold for S15 (US$29). The average ticket price was set to be S40 (US$77)[32] and 75% of all tickets would cost less than S50 (US$97),[35] prices that Magliano says are reasonably accessible to almost everyone in Britain. In addition to stadium seats, there would be 20,000 S10 (US$19) tickets for the Olympic Park to watch events on big screens.[35]\\r\\nTo facilitate the Olympics at a governmental level, Cabinet-level Minister for the Olympics Tessa Jowell was set to be responsible for the games. Also in the Cabinet would be an Olympic Security Committee to co-ordinate security planning. In addition, the government proposed to create the Olympic Delivery Authority, which would oversee the construction of venues and see that the games are lived out past 2012.[27]\\r\\nThe organising committee paid special attention to the after effects of the games on London, and what they could do to make sure the games left a lasting impression on London and the world. The LOCOG planned out the uses of important stadiums and transportation systems after the games, as well as the social factors of the 2012 legacy.\\r\\nOne of the most prominent of the proposed legacy is the conversion of the Olympic Village into 3,600?apartments, most of which will be affordable housing. Most of Stratford City will be regenerated with the construction of 500,000 more square metres of space.[22]\\r\\nThe committee outlined plans to donate the sports equipment used in the Games to sports clubs and charities in the United Kingdom.[38]\\r\\nOne of the priorities governing the contents of London's bid was to avoid leaving \\"white elephants\\" after the games. To be sure that important venues and stadiums do not go to waste, the organising committee has planned what to do with them after the games. All venues that will not have a planned use after the games are over will be built as temporary venues.[39]\\r\\nThe 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium will be converted into a 25,000-seat multi-purpose venue to be mainly used for athletics events. The Stadium should become the hub of east London activities when the games end.[39]\\r\\nThe Aquatics Centre after the games will include two 50-metre pools, a 25-metre diving pool and a fitness centre. They will be able to accommodate elite, development, local club and community users. The venue will allow for 3,500?spectators and would host local, national, and worldwide swimming events.[39]\\r\\nTo connect a variety of cycling and walking trails throughout the Lea Valley, the London Velopark will be transformed into a multi-discipline cycling centre. It will be extended further northwards, with the legacy road cycling circuit straddling the A12 and extending into the old Eton Manor site, where the mountain biking area will be located.[40] The transformed stadium will consist of a 3,000-seat velodrome, road track, competition and play BMX tracks, and a mountain biking course for use by all levels of cyclists.[39]\\r\\nThe Olympic Hockey Centre after the games will become a venue providing training and competition facilities for hockey at all levels. It will feature a 5,000 seat arena and a training pitch.[39]\\r\\nIn addition, several of the indoor arenas would be assembled elsewhere in the UK. The construction of the Aquatics Centre and the Velopark was confirmed before London won the Games, so it might be more accurate to call them legacies of the bid rather than of the Games. While the legacy venues would be tailored to London's ongoing needs, some of them would be expensive for that purpose. For example, London will have paid for an 80,000-seat athletics stadium, but will only possess a 25,000-seat stadium.\\r\\nAt the time of the bid, those involved in British sport were hopeful that there would also be a 2012 legacy of increased commitment to sport in the UK, with the social and health benefits they believe that could bring, but it will be difficult to assess whether or not this really happens. Some commentators have argued that it would be better to invest directly in grass roots sport.\\r\\nDisability organisations including the Autism Awareness Campaign UK were confident that the Olympic and Paralympic Games would encourage people across the disability spectrum to take up sport.\\r\\nOther legacy items would include the conversion of the Olympic Village Polyclinic into a lifelong learning centre for the east London community with a nursery and primary and secondary schools, and the conversion of the media and press centre into a creative industries centre for east London. The organisers claimed that 3,000 new permanent jobs would be created, but opponents of the games were concerned that some of the 11,000 existing jobs in the Olympic Zone may be lost.[41] It was also hoped that there will be a wider economic effect from the improvements which the games might make to London's image.\\r\\nThe planned transport legacy for the capital included new bus transit schemes, extensions to existing Underground lines, redevelopments of London Underground stations and upgrades to the trains used. There were also to be many upgrades to National Rail services with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, a new high-speed rail link, several new stations and upgrades to stations such as Kings Cross St. Pancras. Please view the Legacy Map to see the upgrades to the London Transport network in context.\\r\\nThe Head of the IOC evaluation commission praised the passion behind the London 2012 bid when they visited Stratford and other places in the city. The IOC evaluation commission chair Nawal El Moutawakel speaking at a press conference in London observed: \\"We could feel it, hear it and see it.\\" She added, \\"It was in every speech and every word.\\"[42]\\r\\n2012 was seen as a window of opportunity as observers saw Europe as the destination for the Games. Four of the five finalist cities were from Europe.\\r\\nSupport for the bid topped 70% of the people of the United Kingdom and 68% of the people in London, as shown by an opinion poll commissioned by the IOC. Some of the support can be attributed to the city's \\"Back the Bid\\" campaign, which included the slogan on posters that were hung around London in the months leading up to the decision to award the 2012 Games to London. Many disability organisations including the Autism Awareness Campaign UK urged all people with disabilities to back the London 2012 bid.\\r\\nOn 17 June 2005, British Prime Minister Tony Blair reiterated the Government's total commitment to London's bid for the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. Mr Blair told BBC Five Live that he would be travelling to Singapore with the London delegation to stress the \\"complete 100% support\\" of politicians from all the major political parties in the country. \\"The most important thing is to show people that the Government is absolutely behind the bid\\", said Mr Blair, who travelled to the Far East before returning to chair the 31st G8 summit at Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire, Scotland. The leaders of the opposition parties also attended the meeting and expressed their support of the venture.\\r\\nMany Londoners challenged the high cost of the Olympics and the S20 per year council tax rise to fund it as well as the possibility of white elephant sites like the Millennium Dome being left. Additionally there were concerns that unions, including the RMT, would strike near or during the proceedings for bonuses and that construction deadlines would not be met.\\r\\nOutside of London the success was not universally welcomed, with fears that the event would divert funding from the rest of the country and that the rest of the United Kingdom would be forced to help fund it, for no benefit. Local business?ÿ some extant in this area for over 100?years?ÿ were questioning the package of measures in place to allow them to find new sites when the new Olympic village displaced them.\\r\\nComparison had been drawn between the Manchester bid and this one, in terms of the amount of government support, and the overwhelmingly hostile attitude of the London-based press to Manchester's bid. Furthermore the cost of travelling and accommodation would rise across London which many thought would outprice tourists and leave many events under-attended.\\r\\nThe International Olympic Committee's evaluation report was generally very positive. It scored poorly on the transportation and public/government support aspects of the evaluation, but received a 10 in accommodations.\\r\\nLondon has proposed Games based on providing world-class facilities and services for the athletes, and a legacy for sport and the community. Whilst the Olympic Park would undoubtedly leave a strong sporting and environmental legacy for London, the magnitude of the project, including the planned upgrade and expansion of transport infrastructure, would require careful planning to ensure all facilities and rehabilitation projects were completed on time. Air quality in London at proposed Games-time is generally satisfactory. Increasing levels of ozone pollution are however a concern, but legislation and actions now in place are aimed at correcting that trend. With its rich history, the capacities of UK Paralympic Sport are among the best in the world. Athletes have been closely involved in the planning of the Olympic Village. The east side of the village would appear to be somewhat crowded.\\r\\nCoordinates: 513246N 00046W? / ?51.54615N 0.01269W? / 51.54615; -0.01269","input":"When did london win the 2012 olympic bid?"},{"output":"Ernest Michaux","context":"The history of the motorcycle begins in the second half of the 19th century. Motorcycles are descended from the \\"safety bicycle,\\" a bicycle with front and rear wheels of the same size and a pedal crank mechanism to drive the rear wheel.[1] Despite some early landmarks in its development, the motorcycle lacks a rigid pedigree that can be traced back to a single idea or machine. Instead, the idea seems to have occurred to numerous engineers and inventors around Europe at around the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1860s Pierre Michaux, a blacksmith in Paris, founded 'Michaux et Cie' (\\"Michaux and company\\"), the first company to construct bicycles with pedals called a velocipede at the time, or \\"Michauline\\".[2] The first steam powered motorcycle, the Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede, can be traced to 1867, when Pierre's son Ernest Michaux fitted a small steam engine to one of the 'velocipedes'.[3]\\r\\nThe design went to America when Pierre Lallement, a Michaux employee who also claimed to have developed the prototype in 1863, filed for the first bicycle patent with the US patent office in 1866.[4] In 1868 an American, Sylvester H. Roper of Roxbury, Massachusetts developed a twin-cylinder steam velocipede, with a coal-fired boiler between the wheels. Roper's contribution to motorcycle development ended suddenly when he died demonstrating one of his machines in Cambridge, Massachusetts on June 1, 1896.[3]\\r\\nAlso in 1868, a French engineer Louis-Guillaume Perreaux patented a similar steam powered single cylinder machine, the Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede, with an alcohol burner and twin belt drives, which was possibly invented independently of Roper's. Although the patent is dated 1868, nothing indicates the invention had been operable before 1871.[3]\\r\\nIn 1881, Lucius Copeland of Phoenix, Arizona designed a much smaller steam boiler which could drive the large rear wheel of an American Star high-wheeler at 12?mph. In 1887 Copeland formed the Northrop Manufacturing Co. to produce the first successful 'Moto-Cycle' (actually a three-wheeler).[3]\\r\\nThe very first commercial design for a self-propelled bicycle was a three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol Cycle, conceived of and built by Edward Butler in England in 1884.[5] He exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1884, two years earlier than Karl Benz invented his first automobile who is generally recognized as the inventor of the modern automobile. Butler's vehicle was also the first design to be shown at the 1885 International Inventions Exhibition in London.\\r\\nThe vehicle was built by the Merryweather Fire Engine company in Greenwich, in 1888.[6] the Butler Petrol Cycle (first recorded use of the term)[6] It was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear wheel directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2?G5-inch {57G127-mm})[6] flat twin four stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery),[6] equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach),[6] and Ackermann steering,[7] all of which were state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air.[6] The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels.[6] It wasn't, however, a commercial success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.\\r\\nAnother early internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Petroleum Reitwagen. It was designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt, Germany in 1885.[8] This vehicle was unlike either the safety bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of steering axis angle and no fork offset, and thus did not use the principles of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.[9] The inventors called their invention the Reitwagen (\\"riding car\\"). It was designed as an expedient testbed for their new engine, rather than a true prototype vehicle.[10][11]\\r\\nIn the decade from the late 1880s, dozens of designs and machines emerged, particularly in Germany and England, and soon spread to America.[12] During this early period of motorcycle history, there were many manufacturers since bicycle makers were adapting their designs for the new internal combustion engine.\\r\\nIn 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmller became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle (German: Motorrad).[10][11][13][14] However, only a few hundred examples of this motorcycle were ever built. The first instance of the term \\"motor cycle\\" also appears in English the same year in materials promoting machines developed by E.J. Pennington,[15] although Pennington's motorcycles never progress past the prototype stage.[16]\\r\\nExcelsior Motor Company, originally a bicycle manufacturing company based in Coventry, England, began production of their first motorcycle model in 1896, available for purchase by the public. The first production motorcycle in the US was the Orient-Aster, built by Charles Metz in 1898 at his factory in Waltham, Massachusetts.\\r\\nIn the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of bicycles adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the nineteenth century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both went on to develop automobiles.\\r\\nAt the turn of the century the first major mass-production firms were set up.\\r\\nIn 1901 English quadricycle and bicycle maker Royal Enfield introduced its first motorcycle, with a 239?cc engine mounted in the front and driving the rear wheel through a belt. In 1898, English bicycle maker Triumph decided to extend its focus to include motorcycles, and by 1902, the company had produced its first motorcyclea bicycle fitted with a Belgian-built engine. A year later, it was the largest motorcycle manufacturer with an annual production of over 500 units. Other British firms were Norton and Birmingham Small Arms Company who began motorbike production in 1902 and 1910, respectively.[17]\\r\\nIn 1901, the Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company, which had been founded by two former bicycle racers, designed the so-called \\"diamond framed\\" Indian Single, whose engine was built by the Aurora Firm in Illinois per Indian's specifications. The Single was made available in the deep blue. Indian's production was up to over 500 bikes by 1902, and would rise to 32,000, its best ever, in 1913.[18][19] producing over 20,000 bikes per year.[20] The American company Harley-Davidson started producing motorcycles in 1903.\\r\\nDuring this period, experimentation and innovation were driven by the popular new sport of motorcycle racing, with its powerful incentive to produce tough, fast, reliable machines. These enhancements quickly found their way to the publics machines.[12]\\r\\nChief August Vollmer of the Berkeley, California Police Department is credited with organizing the first official police motorcycle patrol in the United States in 1911.[21] By 1914, motorcycles were no longer just bicycles with engines; they had their own technologies, although many still maintained bicycle elements, like the seats and suspension.\\r\\nDuring the First World War, motorbike production was greatly ramped up for the war effort to supply effective communications with front line troops. Messengers on horses were replaced with dispatch riders on motorcycles carrying messages, performing reconnaissance personnel and acting as a military police. American company Harley-Davidson was devoting over 50% of its factory output toward military contract by the end of the war. The British company Triumph Motorcycles sold more than 30,000 of its Triumph Type H model to allied forces during the war. With the rear wheel driven by a belt, the Model H was fitted with a 499?cc air-cooled four-stroke single-cylinder engine. It was also the first Triumph not to be fitted with pedals, so was a true motorcycle.[22]\\r\\nThe Model H in particular, is regarded by many as having been the first \\"modern motorcycle\\".[23] Introduced in 1915 it had a 550cc side-valve four-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox and belt transmission. It was so popular with its users that it was nicknamed the \\"Trusty Triumph.\\"[24]\\r\\nBy 1920, Harley-Davidson became the largest manufacturer,[25] with their motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries.[26][27] By the late 1920s or early 1930s, DKW in Germany took over as the largest manufacturer.[28][29][30] BMW motorcycles came on the scene in 1923 with a shaft drive and an opposed-twin or \\"boxer\\" engine enclosed with the transmission in a single aluminum housing.\\r\\nBy 1931, Indian and Harley-Davidson were the only two American manufacturers producing commercial motorcycles.[31] This two-company rivalry in the United States remained until 1953, when the Indian Motorcycle factory in Springfield, Massachusetts closed and Royal Enfield took over the Indian name.[32]\\r\\nThere were over 80 different makes of motorcycle available in Britain in the 1930s, from the familiar marques like Norton, Triumph and AJS to the obscure, with names like New Gerrard, NUT, SOS, Chell and Whitwood,[33] about twice as many motorcycle makes competing in the world market during the early 21st century.\\r\\nIn 1937, Joe Petrali set a new land speed record of 136.183?mph (219.165?km/h) on a modified Harley-Davidson 61?cubic inch (1,000?cc) overhead valve-driven motorcycle.[31] The same day, Petrali also broke the speed record for 45?cubic inch (737?cc) engine motorcycles.\\r\\nIn Europe, production demands, driven by the buildup to World War II, included motorcycles for military use, and BSA supplied 126,000 BSA M20 motorcycles to the British armed forces, starting in 1937 and continuing until 1950. Royal Enfield also produced motorcycles for the military, including a 125?cc lightweight motorcycle that could be dropped (in a parachute-fitted tube cage) from an aircraft.\\r\\nAfter the World War II, some American veterans found a replacement for the camaraderie, excitement, danger and speed of life at war in motorcycles. Grouped into loosely organized clubs, motorcycle riders in the US created a new social institutionthe motorcyclists or \\"bikers\\"which was later skewed by the \\"outlaw\\" persona Marlon Brando portrayed in the 1953 film The Wild One.[34]\\r\\nIn Europe, on the other hand, post-war motorcycle producers were more concerned with designing practical, economical transportation than the social aspects, or \\"biker\\" image.[34] Italian designer Piaggio introduced the Vespa in 1946, which experienced immediate and widespread popularity. Imports from the UK, Italy and Germany, thus found a niche in US markets that American bikes did not fill.\\r\\nThe BSA Group purchased Triumph Motorcycles in 1951 to become the largest producer of motorcycles in the world claiming \\"one in four\\".[citation needed] The German NSU was the largest manufacturer from 1955[citation needed] until 1959 when Honda became the largest manufacturer.[35][36]\\r\\nBritish manufacturers Triumph, BSA, and Norton retained a dominant position in some markets until the rise of the Japanese manufacturers, led by Honda, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The role of the motorcycle shifted in the 1960s, from the tool of a life to a toy of a lifestyle. It became part of an image, of status, a cultural icon for individualism, a prop in Hollywood B-movies.[12]\\r\\nThe motorcycle also became a recreational machine for sport and leisure, a vehicle for carefree youth, not essential transportation for the mature family man or woman, and the Japanese were able to produce modern designs more quickly, more cheaply, and of better quality than their competitors. Their motorbikes were more stylish and more reliable, so the British manufacturers fell behind as mass-market producers.\\r\\nHonda, which was officially founded in Japan on September 24, 1948, introduced their SOHC inline-four engine CB750 in 1969, which was inexpensive and immediately successful.[citation needed] It established the across-the-frame-four engine configuration as a design with huge potential for power and performance. Shortly after the introduction of the SOHC, Kawasaki demonstrated the potential of the four-stroke four-cylinder engine with the introduction of the KZ900.\\r\\nSuzuki, Kawasaki and the Yamaha each started producing motorcycles in the 1950s. Meanwhile, the sun was setting on British dominion over the big-displacement motorbike market.\\r\\nThe excellence of Japanese motorcycles caused similar effects in all Western markets: many Italian bike firms either went bust or only just managed to survive. As a result, BMW's worldwide sales sagged in the 1960s, but came back strongly with the introduction of a completely redesigned \\"slash-5\\" series for model year 1970.\\r\\nFrom the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of the pioneering work of the East German Daniel Zimmermann (rotary disc valve) and MZ's Walter Kaaden who developed the two-stroke expansion chamber in the 1950s. These ideas were taken up by Suzuki when Ernst Degner, the MZ engineer and rider, defected to the West on 13 September 1961 after retiring from the 125cc Swedish Grand Prix at Kristianstad. Degner, an excellent engineer, immediately joined Suzuki and his knowledge became their technology springboard.\\r\\nHarley-Davidson in the US at the time suffered from the same problems as the European firms, but its unique product range, American tariff laws and nationalism-driven customer loyalty allowed it to survive. One alleged flaw, however, was retaining the characteristic Harley-Davidson 45 engine vee-angle, which causes excess vibration as well as the loping Harley-Davidson sound.\\r\\nA factory full fairing was introduced by BMW motorcycle in the R100RS of 1977, the first factory fairing produced in quantity.[37] In 1980, BMW stimulated the \\"adventure touring\\" category of motorcycling with its dual-sport model, the R80G/S. In 1988, BMW was the first motorcycle manufacturer to introduce anti-lock-brakes (ABS) on its sporting K100RS-SE and K1 models.[citation needed]\\r\\nToday the Japanese manufacturers, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha dominate the large motorcycle industry, although Harley-Davidson still maintains a high degree of popularity, particularly in the United States.\\r\\nRecent years have seen a resurgence in the popularity around the world of many other motorcycle brands, including BMW, Triumph and Ducati, and the emergence of Victory as a second successful mass-builder of big-twin American cruisers.\\r\\nIn November 2006, the Dutch company E.V.A. Products BV Holland announced that the first commercially available diesel-powered motorcycle, its Track T-800CDI, achieved production status.[38] The Track T-800CDI uses an 800?cc three-cylinder Daimler Chrysler diesel engine. However, other manufacturers, including Royal Enfield, had been producing diesel-powered bikes since at least 1965.[39]\\r\\nThere is a large demand for small, cheap motorcycles in the developing world, and many of the firms meeting that demand now also compete in mature markets, such as China's Hongdou which makes a version of Honda's venerable CG125.[40]\\r\\nMotorcycle taxis are commonplace in the developing world. Scooters, mopeds and motorcycles offer a fast, cheap and risky way around snarled traffic and scarce mass transit, as they can easily squeeze through jams.[41]\\r\\nThe first ethanol flex fuel motorcycle in the world was launched to the Brazilian market by Honda in March 2009, the CG 150 Titan Mix.[42][43][44] During the first eight months after its market launch the CG 150 Titan Mix had captured a 10.6% market share, and ranking second in sales of new motorcycles in the Brazilian market in 2009.[45] In September 2009, Honda launched a second flexible-fuel motorcycle,[46] and by December 2010 both Honda flexible-fuel motorcycles had reached cumulative production of 515,726 units, representing an 18.1% market share of the Brazilian new motorcycle sales in that year.[47][48] As of January 2011 there were four flex-fuel motorcycle models available in the market,[49] and production reached the one million milestone in June 2011.[47][48][50]","input":"Who was the first person to make a motorcycle?"},{"output":"Meerut University","context":"Chaudhary Charan Singh University (CCS University), formerly Meerut University, is a public state university located in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India.

With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[16] The foreign expansionparticularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hutwas cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]\\r\\nIn May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[17] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[18]\\r\\nIn 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[19]\\r\\nIn 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain \\"excess levels of chemical residue\\". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[20]\\r\\nThe company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[21] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.\\r\\nYum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[22]\\r\\nIn 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[23] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[24]\\r\\nIn 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[25] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[26] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[27]\\r\\nIn the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[28] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[23] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[25]\\r\\nIn 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[29]\\r\\nThe current executive chairman of Yum! Brands is Greg Creed. The previous CEO was David C. Novak.[30] Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001.[31] Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015.[32] At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman.\\r\\nOn October 20, 2015, Yum! Brands, Inc., announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.[33] Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016.[34]\\r\\nSince 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.[35]","input":"Who owns kentucky fried chicken and taco bell?"},{"output":"nine teams","context":"The Canadian Football League (CFL; French: Ligue canadienne de football, LCF) is a professional sports league in Canada. The CFL is the highest level of competition in Canadian football. Its nine teams, which are located in nine separate cities, are divided into two divisions: the East Division, with four teams, and the West Division with five teams.\\r\\nAs of 2016, the league features a 20-week regular season, which traditionally runs from late June to early November; each team plays 18 games with at least two bye weeks. Following the regular season, six teams compete in the league's three-week divisional playoffs, which culminate in the Grey Cup championship game in late November, one of the country's largest annual sports and television events.[2]\\r\\nThe CFL was officially founded on January 19, 1958.[3] The league was formed from a merger between the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union founded in 1907 and the Western Interprovincial Football Union founded in 1936.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRugby football began to be played in Canada in the 1860s, and many of the first Canadian football teams played under the auspices of the Canadian Rugby Football Union (CRFU), founded in 1884.[5] The CRFU was reorganized as the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) in 1891, and served as an umbrella organization for several provincial and regional unions. The Grey Cup was donated by Governor General Earl Grey in 1909 to the team winning the Senior Amateur Football Championship of Canada. By that time, the sport as played in Canada had diverged markedly from its rugby origins, and started to become more similar to the American game. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the two senior leagues of the CRU, the eastern Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU or Big Four) and Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) gradually evolved from amateur to professional leagues, and amateur teams such as those in the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) were no longer competitive in their Cup challenges. The ORFU withdrew from Grey Cup competition after the 1954 season, heralding the start of the modern era of professional Canadian football, in which the Grey Cup has been exclusively contested by professional teams (Since 1965, Canada's top amateur teams, competing in U Sports, have competed for the Vanier Cup).\\r\\nIn 1956, the IRFU and WIFU formed a new umbrella organization, the Canadian Football Council (CFC). In 1958, the CFC left the CRU and became the Canadian Football League. As part of an agreement between the CRU and CFL, the CFL took possession of the Grey Cup, even though amateurs had not competed for it since 1954. The CRU remained the governing body for amateur play in Canada, eventually adopting the name Football Canada. Initially, the two unions remained autonomous, and there was no intersectional play between eastern (IRFU) and western (WIFU) teams except at the Grey Cup final. This situation was roughly analogous to how the American baseball leagues operated for years. The IRFU was renamed the Eastern Football Conference in 1960, while the WIFU was renamed the Western Football Conference in 1961. Also in 1961, limited intersectional play was introduced. Because the West played 16 games by this time while the East still only played 14, this arrangement oddly allowed both the four team Eastern Conference and the five team Western Conference to play three games per intraconference opponent and one game per interconference opponent. In 1974, the Eastern Conference extended its schedule to 16 games. It was not until 1981 that the two conferences agreed to a full merger, becoming the East and West Divisions of the CFL. With the merger came a fully balanced and interlocking schedule of 16 games per season; starting in 1986, the CFL expanded the regular season schedule to the current 18 games.\\r\\nThe separate histories of the IRFU and the WIFU accounted for the fact that two teams had basically the same name: the IRFU's Ottawa Rough Riders were often called the \\"Eastern Riders\\", while the WIFU's Saskatchewan Roughriders were called the \\"Western Riders\\" or \\"Green Riders\\". Other team names had traditional origins. With rowing a national craze in the late 19th century, the Argonaut Rowing Club of Toronto formed a rugby team for its members' off-season participation. The football team name Toronto Argonauts still remains even though it and the rowing club have long since gone their separate ways. After World War II, the two teams in Hamiltonthe Tigers and the Flying Wildcatsmerged both their organizations into the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.\\r\\nThe league remained stable with nine franchisesthe BC Lions, Calgary Stampeders, Edmonton Eskimos, Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Toronto Argonauts, Ottawa Rough Riders and Montreal Alouettesfrom its 1958 inception until 1981. After the 1981 season, the Alouettes folded and were replaced the next year by a new franchise named the Concordes.\\r\\nIn 1986 the Concordes were renamed the Alouettes to attract more fan support, but the team folded the next year. The demise of the Alouettes forced the League to move its easternmost Western team, Winnipeg, into the East Division (it would stay there between 1987ÿ94, 1997ÿ2001, and once more from 2006ÿ2013).\\r\\nIn 1993, the league admitted its first United States-based franchise, the Sacramento Gold Miners. After modest success, the league then expanded further in the U.S. in 1994 with the Las Vegas Posse, Baltimore Stallions, and Shreveport Pirates. For the 1995 campaign, the American teams were split off into their own South Division, and two more teams, the Birmingham Barracudas and Memphis Mad Dogs, were added; at the same time, the Posse folded and the Gold Miners relocated to become the San Antonio Texans. In 1995, the Stallions became the only non-Canadian team to win the Grey Cup.\\r\\nDespite all American teams having the advantage of not being bound to the CFL's minimum Canadian player quotas, only the Stallions proved to be an on-field and off-field success. The establishment of the NFL's Baltimore Ravens, worsening financial problems among the league's core Canadian teams, and the inconsistent performance of the American teams prompted the CFL to abandon its American experiment and retrench its Canadian operations. The Stallions organization was used as the basis for a revival of the Montreal Alouettes.\\r\\nThe CFL returned to an all-Canadian format in 1996 with nine teams;[6] the league conducted a dispersal draft to distribute players from the shuttered American-based teams; however, the Ottawa Rough Riders, in existence since 1876, folded after the 1996 season (another dispersal draft was conducted as result to distribute the former Rough Rider players amongst the remaining eight teams). Toronto and recently revived Montreal also were struggling; Montreal's woes were solved by moving to Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, a much smaller venue than the cavernous Olympic Stadium.\\r\\nIn 1997, the NFL provided a $3-million USD interest-free loan to the financially struggling CFL. In return, the NFL was granted access to CFL players entering a defined two-month window in the option year of their contract. This was later written into the CFL's collective bargaining agreement with its players. The CFL's finances have since stabilized and they eventually repaid the loan. The CFLÿNFL agreement expired in 2006. Both leagues have been attempting to reach a new agreement, but the CFL broke off negotiations in November 2007 after Canadian telecommunications firm Rogers Communications paid $78 million to host seven Bills games in Toronto over five seasons.[7][8]\\r\\nIn 2002, the league expanded back to nine teams with the creation of the Ottawa Renegades. After four seasons of financial losses, the Renegades were suspended indefinitely before the 2006 season; their players were absorbed by the remaining teams in a dispersal draft, as was the case during 1996 and 1997.\\r\\nIn 2005, the league set an all-time attendance record with a total attendance of more than 2.3 million.[9] With the absence of Ottawa from 2006 onwards, league attendance hovered around the 2 million mark. It stood at 2,029,875 in 2012 for a single game average of 28,193.[10] The 2007 season was a recent high point with average game attendance of 29,167, the best since 1983.[11]\\r\\nWith Mark Cohon as commissioner of the league the CFL entered a period of stability and growth. New television deals, two new collective bargaining agreements, the 100th Grey Cup celebration, and widespread stadium renovation and rebuilding highlighted this era. The 100th anniversary of the Grey Cup had the highest ever television ratings for a championship game in English Canada.[12]\\r\\nDuring the 2000s the CFL had the third highest per-game attendance of any North American sports league and the seventh highest per-game attendance of any sports league worldwide. A 2006 survey conducted at the University of Lethbridge confirmed that the CFL was the second most popular sports league in Canada, with the following of 19% of the total adult Canadian population compared to 30% for the NHL. The NFL had 11% following, with a total of 26% following at least one of the pro football leagues. In other words, approximately 80% of Canadian football fans follow the CFL, and about 55% follow the NFL.[13]\\r\\nDuring Mark Cohon's time in office many of the teams either undertook major renovations to their existing stadiums, or constructed brand new stadiums. The Montreal Alouettes were the first to undertake this project, adding 5,000 seats to Percival Molson Memorial Stadium in time for the 2010 CFL season.[14] The Edmonton Eskimos and Calgary Stampeders also renovated their respective stadia and facilities for the 2010 season.[15] In 2011, the BC Lions played under a new, retractable roof in BC Place after spending one and a half seasons at Empire Field.[16] In 2013, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers moved to an entirely new stadium at the University of Manitoba. The Hamilton Tiger-Cats began using their new stadium, Tim Hortons Field, after spending 2013 at Guelph University and the first half of the 2014 season at McMaster University's football field following the demolition of the iconic Ivor Wynne Stadium.[17]\\r\\nIn 2014 the Ottawa Redblacks kicked off their inaugural season (having been awarded a franchise in 2008[18]), becoming the third Ottawa franchise in CFL history. The new Ottawa franchise returned the league to 9 team structure, with 5 teams in West Division and 4 in the East. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers moved back to the West Division.[19] The 2014 expansion Ottawa Redblacks played at the massively renovated Frank Clair Stadium, now branded as TD Place Stadium.[20]\\r\\nIn Mark Cohon's last year as commissioner he negotiated a new five-year collective bargaining agreement (from 2014 through the 2018 season) between the CFL and the CFLPA.[21]\\r\\nThe Toronto Argonauts entered a period of transition off the field, with new ownership and a new stadium. The Argonauts were sold by politician/businessman David Braley to Bell Media and MLSE chairman Larry Tanenbaum.[22] At the start of the 2016 season the Argos moved to BMO Field after more than twenty seasons at the Rogers Centre (formerly called the SkyDome from 1989ÿ2005).[23] Construction on New Mosaic Stadium for the Saskatchewan Roughriders was completed in October 2016[24] and the first game was played in the 2017 CFL season.[25]\\r\\nOn May 22, 2015, Michael Sam signed a two-year contract with Montreal Alouettes of the CFL.[26][27] The signing made him the first openly gay player in the league's history.[27] Sam left the team the day before the first preseason game, citing personal reasons.[28] As reported by Fox Sports, Sam returned to Montreal to continue his professional football career.[29] but again left on August 14, permanently, again citing personal reasons.\\r\\nImmediately following the 2015 season Jeffrey Orridge announced a re-branding for the CFL, including a new logo, motto, uniforms for all nine teams and website.[30] After not having a drug enforcement policy in effect for the 2015 season the league and the CFLPA agreed to a new drug policy.[31] On April 12, 2017 the Board of Governors and Jeffrey Orridge agreed to part ways, effective June 30, 2017; Orridge cited \\"differing views on the future of the league\\" between him and the Board of Governors for the departure, with both sides stating the decision was mutual and amicable.[32] His last day as commissioner was June 15, 2017.[33] Jim Lawson, The CFL's Chair of the Board of Governors, took over the duties of interim Commissioner until a suitable replacement was found.[34]\\r\\nOn June 29, 2017, the CFL announced Randy Ambrosie would succeed Orridge as CFL commissioner.[35] The move was made official on July 5, 2017, with Ambrosie named as the 14th Commissioner of the league that day.[36] Having spent 9 seasons as a player with the Calgary Stampeders, Toronto Argonauts and Edmonton Eskimos from 1985ÿ1993, Ambrosie is the first commissioner to have played in the league since Larry Smith left the position in 1996.\\r\\nNote: team franchise history is listed as it is recognised by the CFL in its publication Facts, Figures and Records (2015).[44]\\r\\nPotential CFL expansion markets are the Maritimes, Quebec City, Saskatoon, London, and Windsor, all of which have been lobbying (unsuccessfully to date) for Canadian Football League franchises in recent years.[45][46][47]\\r\\nSince the 1980s, the CFL has occasionally played exhibition and, later, regular-season games at various cities in the Maritimes, including Canada Games Stadium in Saint John, New Brunswick; Huskies Stadium in Halifax, Nova Scotia; and Moncton Stadium in Moncton, New Brunswick. The league conditionally approved an expansion franchise, the Atlantic Schooners, for play in the 1984 season, but the team never made it to play.\\r\\nAtlantic Canada lacks a permanently suitable CFL stadium, which was the main problem that kept the Schooners off the field. As of 2010, the largest stadium in the Maritimes is Moncton Stadium, which has 10,000 permanent seats and can reach 20,000 capacity with temporary seats.[48] A pre-season game, dubbed Touchdown Atlantic, was held in Halifax in the 2005 CFL season and regular season games were played in Moncton under the same branding in 2010, 2011, and 2013.[49] All 20,000 seats for the 2010 Moncton game sold out in 32 hours;[50] the 2013 game did not sell out. Former Commissioner Mark Cohon has stated that Moncton Stadium would require massive renovations, the cost of which would be comparable to that of constructing a whole new stadium, to host a CFL team permanently.[51] In November 2015 the Halifax city council voted 9ÿ7 against purchasing land that would then be used to build a 20,000-seat stadium. It was agreed that the price tag for the land was too much, but the close 9ÿ7 vote indicates municipal interest in building a near CFL sized stadium in Halifax.[52]\\r\\nAlthough Atlantic Canada's expansion bids have typically branded themselves as covering all of Atlantic Canada, the presence of football at any level in Newfoundland and Labrador is practically nonexistent and none of the efforts have attempted to include that province.\\r\\nThere has also been interest in adding a team in Quebec City. In 2003, an exhibition game was held at PEPS Le Stade Extrieur between the Montreal Alouettes and Ottawa Renegades where Montreal won 54ÿ23.[53] In May 2009, Christina Saint Marche, a British businesswoman, announced her interest in operating a team in Quebec Citystating that there would be a natural rivalry with the Montreal Alouettes.[54] During the 2010 Grey Cup state of the league news conference, Cohon noted that the Alouettes hold the rights for the entire province of Quebec and that any expansion would have to be negotiated with them first.[55] Another exhibition game was held in the city on June 13, 2015, when the Montreal Alouettes beat the Ottawa Redblacks 26 to 9. Since Ottawa was unable to use their home stadium TD Place Stadium at Lansdowne Park due to the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup this game was listed as Ottawa's home pre-season game.[56]\\r\\nSaskatoon last hosted top-level Canadian football in 1935 when the Regina Roughriders left the Saskatchewan Rugby Football Union to form the WIFU. The Saskatoon Hilltops (along with another Saskatchewan-based team, the Moose Jaw Millers) eventually suspended operations due to World War II; the Hilltops would remain an amateur team when they returned in 1947 (they have since played in the Canadian Junior Football League). Saskatoon last won a provincial title in 1921 and by the point of the Hilltops' closure, the Regina Roughriders had been the dominant team in the province for two decades.\\r\\nIn early 2012, management at Credit Union Centre publicly expressed its desire to bring a CFL team to Saskatoon. However, the Regina-based Saskatchewan Roughriders have long branded themselves as a province-wide team, and claimed that Saskatchewan is too small to support two teams.[45] In any event, Saskatoon also lacks a suitable outdoor stadium. Its largest, Griffiths Stadium which plays host to the University of Saskatchewan's Saskatchewan Huskies, seats only 6,171 spectators. The Gordie Howe Bowl, which has hosted CFL exhibitions in the past, has even fewer seats (it seats 3,950 people).\\r\\nSince Ottawa's return to the league in 2014, the CFL season has included:\\r\\nTeam training camps open 28 days prior to the first regular season game of the season, a camp solely devoted to first year players is allowed the 3 days before the main camp opens. The pre-season exhibition schedule is two weeks long with each team playing two games against teams from its own division.\\r\\nThe regular season is 20 weeks long, with games beginning the weekend before Canada Day weekend and finishing by early November. The CFL's nine current teams are divided into two divisions: the East Division with four teams and the West Division, with five teams. Each team plays two games against each of the other eight teams, plus two divisional games with opponents rotating each season. With 81 regular season games being played, each team gets two bye weeks except for one team that plays two games in one week and receives three bye weeks.\\r\\nThe most popular featured week in the CFL season is the Labour Day Classic, played over the course of the Labour Day weekend, where the matchups feature the first half of home-and-home series between the traditional geographic rivalries of TorontoÿHamilton (a rivalry which began in 1873[5]), EdmontonÿCalgary (see Battle of Alberta), and WinnipegÿSaskatchewan. With the return of Ottawa, it is expected that they will resume playing Montreal to round out the week's games. In years that Ottawa or Montreal were not in the league, BC would play against one of these teams.[57] The following week's rematch of these games is a popular event as well, especially in recent years, where the rematch of the SaskatchewanÿWinnipeg game has been dubbed the Banjo Bowl.\\r\\nOther features of the regular season schedule are the Hall of Fame Game and the Thanksgiving Day Classic, the doubleheader held on Thanksgiving where the match ups usually do not feature traditional rivalries. Starting in 2010, a neutral site regular season game was played in Moncton under the name Touchdown Atlantic, which has been played in three of the last four seasons.\\r\\nThe league awards points based on regular season results (two for a win, one for a tie and none for a loss). As of the 2011 season, in the event two or more teams in a division finish the season with the same number of points, the tie is broken based on the following criteria (in descending order):[58]\\r\\nThe playoffs begin in November. After the regular season, the top team from each division has an automatic home berth in the division final, and a bye week during the division semifinal. The second-place team from each division hosts the third-place team in the division semifinal, unless a fourth-place team from one division finishes with a better record than a third place team in the other (this provision is known as the crossover rule, and while it implies that it is possible for two teams in the same division to play for the Grey Cup, only two crossover teams have won a semifinal since the rule's 1996 inception, and neither advanced to the Grey Cup). The winners of each division's semifinal game then travel to play the first place teams in the division finals. Since 2005, the division semifinals and division finals have been sponsored by Scotiabank.[59] The two division champions then face each other in the Grey Cup game, which, since 2007, has been held on the fourth or fifth Sunday of November.\\r\\nThe Grey Cup is both the name of the championship of the CFL and the name of the trophy awarded to the victorious team. The Grey Cup is the second-oldest trophy in North American professional sports, after the Stanley Cup. The Grey Cup game is hosted in one of the league's member cities. In recent years, it has been hosted in a different city every year, selected two or more years in advance. The Toronto Argonauts have won the most Grey Cups with sixteen wins total, most recently in 2012. In 2012, the game was held in Toronto at the Rogers Centre, and for the second year in row the cup was won on a team's home field, Toronto beating Calgary 35ÿ22.[60] In 2013, the Grey Cup was won at home for the third consecutive time (by the Saskatchewan Roughriders), which had not been done since Toronto won at home from 1945ÿ1947. In 2016, the Grey Cup was won on the natural grass turf of BMO Field by the Ottawa Redblacks beating the heavily favoured Calgary Stampeders 39ÿ33 in overtime; the first Grey Cup championship for any Ottawa CFL team in 40 years.\\r\\nAs the country's single largest annual sporting event,[2] the Grey Cup has long served as an unofficial Canadian autumn festival generating national media coverage and a large amount of revenue for the host city. Many fans travel from across the country to attend the game and the week of festivities that lead up to it. A 2014 survey found that 48% of Canadians would prefer to watch the Grey Cup over the Super Bowl if they could only watch one or the other, with 52% preferring the Super Bowl.[61]\\r\\nSince 2015, the Grey Cup game is presented by Shaw Communications.[63]\\r\\nFollowing the Grey Cup game, the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player and Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian are selected. A number of league individual player awards, such as the Most Outstanding Player and Most Outstanding Defensive Player, are awarded annually at a special ceremony in the host city during the week before the Grey Cup game; this ceremony is broadcast nationally on TSN. The Annis Stukus Trophy, also known as the Coach of the Year Award, is awarded separately at a banquet held during the off-season each February. While the CFL has not held an all-star game since 1988, an All-Star Team is selected and honoured at the league awards ceremony during Grey Cup week.\\r\\nThe CFL Championship game, the Grey Cup, held the record for the largest television audience in Canadian history. Television coverage on CBC, CTV and Radio-Canada of the 1983 Grey Cup attracted a viewing audience of 8,118,000 people[citation needed] as Toronto edged B.C. 18ÿ17, ending a 31-year championship drought for the Argonauts. At the time, this represented 33% of the Canadian population.[citation needed] This has since been surpassed by the 2002 and 2010 Men's Olympic Gold Medal Hockey Game.[citation needed]\\r\\nCurrently, the official television broadcasters of CFL games are cable network TSN (which began televising CFL games in 1985), while TSN's French-language network RDS broadcasts Montreal Alouettes games for the Quebec television market.[64] Games are typically scheduled for Thursday to Saturday evenings during June, July and August, but switch to more Saturday and Sunday afternoon games during September and October.[65] TSN has created a tradition of at least one Friday night game each week, branded as Friday Night Football. CBC and TSN drew record television audiences for CFL broadcasts in 2005.[66] The 2006 season was the first season in which every regular-season game was televised, as the league implemented an instant replay challenge system.[67] In 2006, the CFL also began offering pay-per-view webcasts of every game on CFL Broadband.[68] Until the end of the 2007 season, CBC and RDS were the exclusive television broadcasters for all playoff games, including the Grey Cup, which regularly draws a Canadian viewing audience in excess of 4?million.[69]\\r\\nSince 2008, TSN and RDS are the exclusive television and Internet broadcasters of all CFL games, including the playoffs and Grey Cup. The five-year agreement, which includes an option for a sixth year, is worth about $16 million annually and marks the first time since 1952 that CBC will not be broadcasting any CFL games. The CFL will no longer be broadcast on Canadian terrestrial television, unless TSN chooses to air the game on its terrestrial partners, CTV or CTV Two (formerly A-Channel); as of 2016, TSN has not transferred any CFL games to broadcast TV. The move to TSN all but assures that all CFL games will be broadcast in high definition.[2] As of 2006[update], TSN was available in about 8.8?million of Canada's 13 million households.[2] The two play-by-play announcers are Chris Cuthbert and Rod Black while the colour commentators are Glen Suitor (with Cuthbert) and Duane Forde (with Black). Instead of merely exercising the option on the contract, TSN opted to renew the contract with the CFL (and thus extend the terrestrial blackout) through 2018 in an agreement announced in March 2013. In 2015, the deal was extended for an additional three years, granting TSN and RDS exclusive CFL television rights through to the 2021 Grey Cup game, along with exclusive Grey Cup rights for Bell Media radio stations.[70]\\r\\nOn June 26, 2013, it was announced that the CFL's U.S. broadcast rights would return to the ESPN Networks for the 2013 season, with five games airing on ESPN2, and 55 airing on ESPN3.[71] This agreement was renewed in 2014 for five years, the same length as the TSN deal (ESPN holds a stake in TSN), with a stipulation that at least 17 games would be carried on ESPN2 (or another ESPN network, such as ESPN or ESPNEWS) each season, including the Grey Cup; this gives ESPN exclusive CFL rights during this time frame. As in previous years, ESPN3 will carry all games not carried on one of the linear channels online.[72][73][74]\\r\\nOn June 19, 2015, it was announced that ESPN Brasil will broadcast CFL games live, beginning on June 25, as a result of the growth of the NFL and College Football fan base in Brazil.[75] BT Sport, which has a licencing partnership with ESPN, has also carried CFL games in the British Isles since 2015.[76]\\r\\nCBC Television, which held a monopoly on Canadian television until 1961, held Canadian professional football broadcast rights beginning the year of its debut, 1952. CTV was born in 1961 part because Toronto businessman John Bassett had won the television rights to the Eastern Conference, and needed a network to air the games. From 1962 through 1986, CBC and CTV shared CFL broadcasting rights. They split playoff games and simulcast the Grey Cup. In 1962, 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1970, CTV commentators were used for the dual network telecast, while in 1963, 1964, 1966 and 1969, CBC announcers were provided. From 1971 through 1986, one network's crew called the first half while the other called the rest of the game. After the 1986 season, CTV dropped coverage of the CFL and the Grey Cup. From 1987 through 1990, the CFL operated its own syndicated network, CFN. Like CTV, CFN split playoff games with CBC. However, CFN had completely separate coverage of the Grey Cup, utilizing its own production and commentators. From 1991 to 2007, all post-season games had been exclusively on CBC; beginning in 2008, the Grey Cup and all other CFL games were carried exclusively on TSN, although the cable provider reserves the right to move the game to sister network CTV (as of 2016, it has never done so, opting to broadcast that Sunday's NFL games on CTV instead.)\\r\\nThe predecessor to the CFL's East Division, the IRFU, had a television contract with NBC in 1954 that provided far more coverage than the NFL's existing contract with DuMont. NBC aired games on Saturday afternoons, competing against college football broadcasts on CBS and ABC. The revenue from the contract allowed the IRFU to directly compete against the NFL for players in the late 1950s, setting up a series of CFL games in the United States beginning in 1958 and a series of interleague exhibitions beginning in 1959. Interest in the CFL in the United States faded dramatically after the debut of the American Football League in 1960.[77]\\r\\nIn 1982, during a players' strike in the NFL, NBC broadcast CFL games in the United States in lieu of the NFL games which were cancelled; the first week of broadcasts featured the NFL on NBC broadcast teams, before a series of blowout games on the network and the resulting low ratings resulted in NBC cutting back and eventually cancelling its CFL coverage. ESPN host Chris Berman became a fan of the game in the early days of ESPN, when the network used to air CFL games, and continues to cover the Canadian league on-air.[78] FNN-SCORE (unrelated to the Canadian The Score) carried games in the late 1980s. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, SportsChannel America carried games, using CBC Television, CFN and TSN feeds. In 1993, several SportsChannel Pacific-produced games that were part of the Sacramento Gold Miners' local package were also shown nationally.\\r\\nBeginning in 1994, with now four US-based teams in the league, ESPN reached a four-year deal with the league to produce and air two games per week and all post-season games on its fledgling ESPN2. They also put some games on the main network to fill broadcast time vacated by the 1994ÿ95 Major League Baseball strike. The 1994 and 1995 Grey Cups were shown live on ESPN2 and then re-aired on ESPN the following day, leading into the network's Monday Night Countdown show. ESPN's on-air talent included a mix of the network's American football broadcasters and established CFL broadcasters from Canada. Most of the US-based teams also had deals with local carriers to show games that were not covered in the national package. Though there were no US teams in the league after 1995, ESPN2 continued showing games until 1997, albeit on a much lighter schedule.\\r\\nAmerica One held CFL broadcast rights in the United States from 2001 to 2009 and aired a majority of the league's games.[79] Until the 2007 season, America One syndicated CFL games to regional sports networks like Altitude, NESN, and MASN; these were discontinued in 2008, mainly because America One and the CFL were able to reach a deal only days before the season began, not allowing the network time to establish agreements with individual RSNs. The Grey Cup aired on Versus on November 22, 2008, with a replay the next day on America One. From 2006 through the 2008 season, Friday Night Football was carried exclusively on World Sport HD in the United States; however, due to the January 2009 shutdown of that channel's parent company, Voom HD Networks, America One reclaimed those rights.\\r\\nNFL Network took over the league broadcast contract in 2010. For the 2010 season, the network carried 14 games, no more than one each week.[80] For 2011, the network increased its output to two games each week.[81] NFL Network declined to continue its coverage after the 2011 season.[82]\\r\\nIn late July 2012, NBC Sports Network acquired rights to the CFL for the remainder of the 2012 season. The NBCSN deal included nine regular season games starting August 27 (including Labour Day Classic games) and all the playoffs.[83] NBC Sports renewed their agreement with the CFL for the 2013 season.[84]\\r\\nESPN America carried a collection of CFL games as part of its lineup until the network shut down in 2013.\\r\\nOn the Internet, all radio broadcasts of CFL games are available for free through each affiliate's Web site. As of 2010, ESPN3 is the only place where CFL games are broadcast on Internet television. ESPN3 (and its predecessor, ESPN360) have broadcast games since 2008; the service is only available in the United States (or its military bases) through specially negotiated cable providers and not in Canada. Video broadcasts were free in Canada at one time, but are no longer available; viewers are able to purchase previous games on the TSN website. A service known as \\"CFL Broadband\\" offered pay-per-view of CFL games in the United States and elsewhere prior to 2009, but the service ceased operations prior to the 2010 season. During America One's time broadcasting CFL games, some CFL video feeds could be found for free due to the fact that a small number of America One affiliates streamed their video on the Internet, even though the CFL discouraged this. On June 16, 2017, the CFL announced it was launching a new International Service over the internet into 130 select regions.[85]\\r\\nIn Canada, Bell Mobility provides streaming of CFL games to its mobile devices, and TSN's streaming service, TSN GO, provides Internet streaming of CFL games to Bell TV and Rogers Cable subscribers.\\r\\nCFL teams have local broadcast contracts with terrestrial radio stations for regular season and playoff games, while TSN Radio owns the rights to the Grey Cup.[86] In 2006, Sirius Satellite Radio gained exclusive rights for North American CFL satellite radio broadcasts and broadcast 25 CFL games per season, including the Grey Cup, through 2008.[87]\\r\\nThe CFL began enforcing a salary cap for the 2007 season of $4.05?million per team. The cap was raised to $4.2?million in the 2008 season and remained at that level for 2009.[88] On June 29, 2010, a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified that raised the salary cap to $4.25?million for the 2010 CFL season and would continue to increase by $50,000 each season until 2013.[89] In 2014, a new CBA was ratified and the salary cap was raised to $5 million per team, with that amount increasing again by $50,000 each year until 2018.[90] Financial penalties for teams that breach the cap are set at $1 to $1 for the first $100,000 over, $2 to $1 for $100,000 to $300,000 over, and $3 to $1 for $300,000 and above. Penalties could also include forfeited draft picks.[91] For 2010, the minimum team salary was set at $3.9?million while the minimum player salary was set at $42,000.[89] With the new CBA in 2014, the salary floor was raised to $4.4 million per team with increases of $50,000 per year, and the minimum salary was raised to $50,000 per year.[90] The average salary per player in 2014 was $96,000 CAD.[92]\\r\\nPlayer compensation is not tied to league revenue, which remains a trade secret. Only the four publicly held teams in the league reveal their financial information, as those companies are required to do so under Canadian law. As of 2013, prior to Ottawa's rejoining the league (at which time Toronto, which is partially owned by a public company, was still fully private), estimates of the CFL's revenue varied between $150?million[93] and $200?million CAD.[94]\\r\\nIn 2006, the active roster limit was increased from 40 to 42 and in 2014 it was again increased to 44.[90] Each team must abide by the national/international ratio rule, which requires teams to keep at least 21 national players, (\\"a Canadian citizen at the time of signing his first contract, was classified as a non-import prior to May 31, 2014, or was physically resident in Canada for an aggregate period of five years prior to reaching the age of 18.\\")[95] with the other 23 players allowed to originate from any country; quarterbacks, of which a team can carry three on a roster, cannot be counted toward the national player requirement, which puts Canadian quarterbacks at a disadvantage compared to other positions in being hired by a CFL franchise.[96] Teams may have up to two players on their reserve roster, and up to 10 on their practice roster.[91] CFL players are represented by the Canadian Football League Players' Association (CFLPA). Each team elects two players to the CFLPA Board of Player Representatives, which meets once per year. Every two years, it elects an executive Board of Directors.[97]\\r\\nEligible Canadian nationals (usually from U Sports football or American college football) are drafted by teams in the annual Canadian College Draft. The CFL Draft usually takes place in May and consists of seven rounds. The first two rounds of the draft are usually shown live on TSN. The CFL Combine (formerly known as the Evaluation Camp), similar to the NFL Combine,[98] precedes the draft. A junior player in the locale of a team may be claimed as a territorial exemption and sign with that team before beginning collegiate play (one recent example is when the BC Lions claimed Andrew Harris[99]). Teams maintain \\"negotiation lists\\" of players they wish to sign as free agents.","input":"1. how many teams currently compete in the canadian football league (cfl)?"},{"output":"Sir Edmund Percival Hillary","context":"Sir Edmund Percival Hillary KG ONZ KBE OSN (20 July 1919 ÿ 11 January 2008) was a New Zealand mountaineer, explorer, and philanthropist. On 29 May 1953, Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers confirmed to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. They were part of the ninth British expedition to Everest, led by John Hunt.\\r\\nHillary became interested in mountaineering while in secondary school. He made his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force as a navigator during World War II. Prior to the 1953 Everest expedition, Hillary had been part of the British reconnaissance expedition to the mountain in 1951 as well as an unsuccessful attempt to climb Cho Oyu in 1952. As part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition he reached the South Pole overland in 1958. He subsequently reached the North Pole, making him the first person to reach both poles and summit Everest.\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest, Hillary devoted most of his life to helping the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he founded. Through his efforts, many schools and hospitals were built in Nepal. From 1985 to 1988 he served as New Zealand's High Commissioner to India and Bangladesh and concurrently as Ambassador to Nepal. Hillary had numerous honours conferred upon him, including the Order of the Garter in 1995.[2] Upon his death in 2008, he was given a state funeral.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary was born to Percival Augustus and Gertrude (ne Clark) Hillary in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July 1919.[3][1] His family moved to Tuakau (south of Auckland) in 1920, after his father, who served at Gallipoli in the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment, was allocated land there.[3] Hillary's grandparents were settlers in northern Wairoa in the mid-19th century, having emigrated from Yorkshire, England.[4]\\r\\nHillary was educated at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School.[3] He finished primary school two years early and at high school achieved average marks.[5]\\r\\nHillary was initially smaller than his peers and very shy, but gained confidence after he learned to box. At 16, his interest in climbing was sparked during a school trip to Mount Ruapehu. After this, Hillary showed more interest in tramping than in studying.[3][6]\\r\\nHe studied mathematics and science at the Auckland University College and in 1939 completed his first major climb, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier, near Aoraki/Mount Cook in the Southern Alps.[3] With his brother Rex, Hillary became a beekeeper,[1][7] a summer occupation that allowed him to pursue climbing in the winter.[8] He joined the Radiant Living Tramping Club, where a holistic health philosophy developed by the health advocate Herbert Sutcliffe was taught. Hillary developed his love for the outdoors on tours with the club through the Waitakere Ranges.[9]\\r\\nUpon the outbreak of World War II, Hillary applied to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) but quickly withdrew the application before consideration, later writing that he was \\"harassed by [his] religious conscience\\".[10] In 1943, the Japanese threat in the Pacific and the arrival of conscription finally undermined his pacifist inclination; Hillary joined the RNZAF as a navigator serving in No. 6 Squadron RNZAF and then No. 5 Squadron RNZAF[10][11] on Catalina flying boats. In 1945, he was sent to Fiji and to the Solomon Islands, where he was badly burnt in a boat accident and repatriated to New Zealand.[10]\\r\\nOn 30 January 1948, Harry Ayres, along with Mick Sullivan, led Hillary and Ruth Adams up the south ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest peak.[12]\\r\\nIn 1951, Hillary was part of a British reconnaissance expedition to Everest led by Eric Shipton,[13] before joining the successful British attempt of 1953. In 1952, Hillary and George Lowe were part of the British team led by Eric Shipton, that attempted Cho Oyu.[14] After that attempt failed due to the lack of route from the Nepal side, Hillary and Lowe crossed the Nup La into Tibet and reached the old Camp II, on the northern side, where all the pre-war expeditions camped.[15]\\r\\nThe route to Everest was closed by Chinese-controlled Tibet, and Nepal allowed only one expedition per year. A Swiss expedition (in which Tenzing took part) had attempted to reach the summit in 1952, but was turned back from the summit by bad weather and exhaustion 800 feet (240?m) below the summit. During a 1952 trip in the Alps, Hillary discovered that he and his friend George Lowe had been invited by the Joint Himalayan Committee for the approved British 1953 attempt and immediately accepted.[17]\\r\\nShipton was named as leader but was replaced by Hunt. Hillary considered pulling out, but both Hunt and Shipton talked him into remaining. Hillary was intending to climb with Lowe, but Hunt named two teams for the assault: Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans; and Hillary and Tenzing. Hillary, therefore, made a concerted effort to forge a working friendship with Tenzing.[17]\\r\\nThe Hunt expedition totalled over 400 people, including 362 porters, 20 Sherpa guides, and 10,000?lbs of baggage,[18][19] and like many such expeditions, was a team effort. Lowe supervised the preparation of the Lhotse Face, a huge and steep ice face, for climbing. Hillary forged a route through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.[17]\\r\\nThe expedition set up base camp in March 1953 and, working slowly, set up its final camp at the South Col at 25,900 feet (7,890?m). On 26 May, Bourdillon and Evans attempted the climb but turned back when Evans' oxygen system failed. The pair had reached the South Summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit.[19][20] Hunt then directed Hillary and Tenzing to go for the summit.[20]\\r\\nSnow and wind held the pair up at the South Col for two days. They set out on 28 May with a support trio of Lowe, Alfred Gregory, and Ang Nyima. The two pitched a tent at 27,900 feet (8,500?m) on 28 May, while their support group returned down the mountain. On the following morning Hillary discovered that his boots had frozen solid outside the tent. He spent two hours warming them before he and Tenzing, wearing 30-pound (14?kg) packs, attempted the final ascent.[17] The crucial move of the last part of the ascent was the 40-foot (12?m) rock face later named the \\"Hillary Step\\". Hillary saw a means to wedge his way up a crack in the face between the rock wall and the ice, and Tenzing followed.[21] From there the following effort was relatively simple. Hillary reported that both men reached the summit at the same time, but in The Dream Comes True, Tenzing said that Hillary had taken the first step atop Mount Everest. They reached Everest's 29,028?ft (8,848 m) summit, the highest point on earth, at 11:30?am.[1][22] As Hillary put it, \\"A few more whacks of the ice axe in the firm snow, and we stood on top.\\"[23]\\r\\nThey spent only about 15 minutes at the summit. Hillary took the famous photo of Tenzing posing with his ice-axe, but Hillary's ascent went unrecorded. BBC News attributed this to Tenzing's having never used a camera,[24][25] but according to Tenzing's autobiography, Man of Everest, when Tenzing offered to take Hillary's photograph Hillary declined: \\"I motioned to Hillary that I would now take his picture. But for some reason he shook his head; he did not want it\\", Tenzing wrote. Tenzing left chocolates in the snow as an offering, and Hillary left a cross that he had been given by John Hunt.[17] Additional photos were taken looking down the mountain, to confirm that they had made it to the top and that the ascent was not faked.[25]\\r\\nThe two had to take care on the descent after discovering that drifting snow had covered their tracks, complicating the task of retracing their steps. The first person they met was Lowe, who had climbed up to bring them hot soup.\\r\\nWell, George, we knocked the bastard off.\\r\\nNews of the expedition reached Britain on the day of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, and the press called the successful ascent a coronation gift.[26] In return, the 37 members of the party received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal with MOUNT EVEREST EXPEDITION engraved on the rim. The group was surprised by the international acclaim they received upon arriving in Kathmandu.[17] Hillary and Hunt were knighted by the young queen,[27] while Tenzing ÿ ineligible for knighthood as a Nepalese citizen ÿ received the George Medal from the British Government for his efforts with the expedition.[28][29][30]\\r\\nHillary climbed ten other peaks in the Himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960ÿ1961, and 1963ÿ1965. He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.[31]\\r\\nHillary narrowly missed becoming a victim in TWA Flight 266 from the American midwest in the 1960 New York air disaster, having been late for his flight.[32]\\r\\nIn the summer of 1962, he was a guest on the television show What's My Line?. The panellists were blindfolded for his appearance. He stumped the panel, comprising Dorothy Kilgallen, guest panelist Merv Griffin, Arlene Francis, and Bennett Cerf.[33]\\r\\nIn 1977, he led a jetboat expedition, titled \\"Ocean to Sky\\", from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source.[34] Between 1977 and 1979, Hillary commentated aboard several Antarctic sightseeing flights operated by Air New Zealand.[35] He was scheduled to commentate on 28 November 1979 Air New Zealand Flight 901, but had to pull out due to work commitments in the United States and was replaced by his close friend Peter Mulgrew. The aircraft crashed into Mount Erebus in Antarctica, killing all 257 on board.[36] Hillary later married Mulgrew's widow.[37][38]\\r\\nIn 1985, he accompanied Neil Armstrong in a small twin-engined ski plane over the Arctic Ocean and landed at the North Pole. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest.[39][40][41][42] This accomplishment inspired generations of explorers to compete over what later was defined as Three Poles Challenge.\\r\\nHillary was highly critical of a decision not to try to rescue David Sharp (an Everest climber who died on the mountain in 2006), saying that leaving other climbers to die is unacceptable, and the desire to get to the summit has become all-important. He also said, \\"I think the whole attitude towards climbing Mount Everest has become rather horrifying. The people just want to get to the top. It was wrong if there was a man suffering altitude problems and was huddled under a rock, just to lift your hat, say good morning and pass on by.\\" He also told the New Zealand Herald that he was horrified by the callous attitude of today's climbers. \\"They don't give a damn for anybody else who may be in distress and it doesn't impress me at all that they leave someone lying under a rock to die\\", and that, \\"I think that their priority was to get to the top and the welfare of ... a member of an expedition was very secondary.\\"[43]\\r\\nAustralian mountaineer Adam Darragh, in turn, considered Hillary's criticism of expedition leader Russell Brice and his team as too harsh.[44] Mark Inglis, while maintaining that he remained on good terms with Hillary after the incident,[45] noted that Sharp was \\"almost frozen solid\\" and \\"effectively dead\\" when the team found him in the difficult terrain on their descent.[46]\\r\\nIn January 2007, Hillary travelled to Antarctica to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of Scott Base. He flew to the station on 18 January 2007 with a delegation including the Prime Minister.[47][48][49] While there he called for the British government to contribute to the upkeep of Robert Falcon Scott's and Ernest Shackleton's huts.[50]\\r\\nOn 22 April 2007, while on a trip to Kathmandu, Hillary was reported to have suffered a fall. There was no comment on the nature of his illness, and he did not immediately seek treatment. He was hospitalised after returning to New Zealand.[51]\\r\\nOn 6 June 1953 Hillary was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal the same year;[27] and on 6 February 1987 was the fourth appointee to the Order of New Zealand.[52] He was also awarded the Star of Nepal from King Tribhuvan.[date?missing][53] On 22 April 1995 Hillary was appointed Knight Companion of The Most Noble Order of the Garter.[2][54] The Government of India conferred on him its second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, posthumously, in 2008.[55] He was also awarded the Polar Medal in 1958 for his part in the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition,[56][57] and the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu, 1st Class of the Kingdom of Nepal in 1953 and the Coronation Medal in 1975.[58] On 17 June 2004 Hillary was awarded Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.[59]\\r\\nTo mark the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest the Nepalese government conferred honorary citizenship upon Hillary at a special Golden Jubilee celebration in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was the first foreign national to receive that honour.[60]\\r\\nIn 1992 Hillary appeared on the updated New Zealand $5 note, thus making him the only New Zealander to appear on a banknote during his or her lifetime, in defiance of the established convention for banknotes of using only depictions of deceased individuals, and current heads of state. The Reserve Bank governor at the time, Don Brash, had originally intended to use a deceased sportsperson on the $5 note but could not find a suitable candidate. Instead he broke with convention by requesting and receiving Hillary's permission?ÿ along with an insistence from Hillary to use Aoraki / Mount Cook rather than Mount Everest in the backdrop.[62]\\r\\nIn 2005 a poll conducted by Reader's Digest put Hillary as \\"New Zealand's most trusted individual\\", beating cyclist Sarah Ulmer and film director Peter Jackson.[63] He kept the title in 2006 and 2007.[64] After his death in 2008 he was succeeded by Willie Apiata VC, a Corporal in the NZSAS.[65]\\r\\nHillary's favoured New Zealand charity was the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre, of which he was patron for 35 years.[66] He was particularly keen on the work this organisation did in introducing young New Zealanders to the outdoors in a very similar way to his first experience of a school trip to Mt Ruapehu at the age of 16. A 2.3-metre (7.5?ft) bronze statue of \\"Sir Ed\\" is installed outside The Hermitage Hotel at Mount Cook Village; it was unveiled by Hillary himself in 2003.[67] Various streets, institutions and organisations around New Zealand and abroad are named after himfor example, the Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate in Otara, which was established by Hillary in 2001.[68]\\r\\nTwo Antarctic features are named after Hillary. The Hillary Coast is a section of coastline south of Ross Island and north of the Shackleton Coast.[69] The Hillary Canyon, an undersea feature in the Ross Sea, appears on the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, published by the International Hydrographic Organization.[70]\\r\\nHillary married Louise Mary Rose on 3 September 1953, soon after the ascent of Everest. A shy man, he relied on his future mother-in-law to propose on his behalf.[7][8][71] They had three children: Peter (born 1954), Sarah (born 1955) and Belinda (1959ÿ1975).[1][20] In 1975 while en route to join Hillary in the village of Phaphlu, where he was helping to build a hospital, Louise and Belinda were killed in a plane crash near Kathmandu airport shortly after take-off.[7] In 1989 he married June Mulgrew, the widow of his close friend Peter Mulgrew, who died having replaced Hillary as speaker on Air New Zealand Flight 901, a sightseeing flight to the Antarctic which crashed into Mount Erebus in 1979.[8][72] His son Peter Hillary has also become a climber, summiting Everest in 1990. In May 2002 Peter climbed Everest as part of a 50th anniversary celebration; Jamling Tenzing Norgay (son of Tenzing; Tenzing himself had died in 1986) was also part of the expedition.[73] Hillary is also survived by six grandchildren.[74]\\r\\nHe spent most of his life (when not away on expeditions) living in a property on Remuera Road in Auckland City,[75] where he enjoyed reading adventure and science fiction novels in his retirement.[75]\\r\\nHillary also built a bach at Whites Beach,[76] one of Auckland's west coast beaches in the former Waitakere City, between Anawhata and North Piha.[77][78] Bob Harvey, mayor of Waitakere City,[79] and friend of Hillary from the early 1970s,[76] said that \\"the West Coast was Sir Ed's second home. Anawhata was his favourite beach; a place he called the most beautiful on the planet.\\"[80] Harvey said that the bach was Hillary's place of solace, where he would go when the media attention became too much ÿ including after his return from conquering Everest.[76] \\"Building the cottage at Whites Beach ÿ he told me ÿ was one of his greatest pleasures.\\" Aside from the bach, Hillary also co-owned a large piece of land in Karekare Valley in the 1970s with fellow climber Mike Gill.[76]\\r\\nThe Hillary family has had a connection with the West Coast of Auckland since 1925, when Hillary's father-in-law, Jim Rose, built a bach at Anawhata.[81] The family donated land at Whites Beach that is now crossed by trampers on the Hillary Trail, named for Edmund (see Tributes, below).[80]\\r\\nThat is the thing that international travel brings home to me ÿ it's always good to be going home. This is the only place I want to live in; this is the place I want to see out my days.\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest he devoted much of his life to helping the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he founded in 1960[83] and led until his death in 2008. Through his efforts many schools and hospitals were built in this remote region of the Himalayas. He was the Honorary President of the American Himalayan Foundation, a United States non-profit body that helps improve the ecology and living conditions in the Himalayas. He was also the Honorary President of Mountain Wilderness, an international NGO dedicated to the worldwide protection of mountains.[84]\\r\\nHillary took part in the 1975 New Zealand general election, as a member of the \\"Citizens for Rowling\\" campaign. His involvement in this campaign was seen as precluding his nomination as Governor-General,[85] which position was instead offered to Keith Holyoake in 1977. In 1985, Hillary was appointed New Zealand High Commissioner to India (concurrently High Commissioner to Bangladesh and Ambassador to Nepal) and spent four and a half years based in New Delhi.[86]\\r\\nIn 1975, Hillary served as a vice president for the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand.[87] The association is New Zealand's national pro-choice advocacy group which was founded in 1971.[88] As at 1978, he was a patron of REPEAL, a New Zealand-wide organisation that sought to repeal the restrictive Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977.[87]\\r\\nOn 11 January 2008, Hillary died of heart failure at the Auckland City Hospital at the age of 88.[89] Hillary's death was announced by New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark at around 11:20?am. She stated that his death was a \\"profound loss to New Zealand\\".[90] His death was recognised by the lowering of flags to half-mast on all Government and public buildings and at Scott Base in Antarctica.[91] Actor and adventurer Brian Blessed, who attempted to climb Everest three times, described Sir Edmund as a \\"kind of titan\\". Hillary was in hospital at the time of his death but was expected to come home that day according to his family.[6][92][93][94][95][96]\\r\\nAfter Hillary's death the Green Party proposed a new public holiday for 20 July or the Monday nearest to it.[97] Renaming mountains after Hillary was also proposed. The Mt Cook Village's Hermitage Hotel, the Sir Edmund Hillary Alpine Centre and Alpine Guides, proposed a renaming of Mount Ollivier, the first mountain climbed by Hillary. The family of Arthur Ollivier, for whom the mountain is named, are against such a renaming.[98]\\r\\nA state funeral was held for Hillary on 22 January 2008,[99] after which his body was cremated. The first part of this funeral was on 21 January when Hillary's casket was taken into Holy Trinity Cathedral to lie in state.[100] On 29 February 2008, in a private ceremony, most of Hillary's ashes were scattered in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf as he had desired.[101] The remainder went to a Nepalese monastery near Everest; a plan to scatter them on the summit was cancelled in 2010.[102]\\r\\nOn 2 April 2008, a service of thanksgiving was held in his honour at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. It was attended by the Queen (but not the Duke of Edinburgh owing to a chest infection) and New Zealand dignitaries including Prime Minister Helen Clark. Sir Edmund's family and family members of Tenzing Norgay attended as well. Gurkha soldiers from Nepal stood guard outside the ceremony.[103][104]\\r\\nOn 5 November 2008, a commemorative set of five stamps was issued.[105]\\r\\nThere have been many calls for lasting tributes to Sir Edmund Hillary. The first major public tribute has been by way of the \\"Summits for Ed\\" tribute tour organised by the Sir Edmund Hillary foundation.[106] This tribute tour went from Bluff at the bottom of the South Island to Cape Reinga at the tip of the North Island, visiting 39 towns and cities along the way. In each venue school children and members of the public were invited to join together to climb a significant hill or site in their area to show their respect for Hillary. Public were also invited to bring small rocks or pebbles that had special significance to them, that would be collected and included in a memorial to Hillary at the base of Mt Ruapehu in the grounds of the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre. Any funds donated during the tour are to be used by the foundation to sponsor young New Zealanders on outdoor courses to continue the values that Hillary espoused. Over 8,000 members of the public attended these \\"Summit\\" climbs between March and May 2008.[107]\\r\\nIn January 2008, Lukla Airport, in Lukla, Nepal, was renamed to TenzingÿHillary Airport in honour of Sir Edmund and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, for their efforts in the construction of the airport.[108][109]\\r\\nOn 23 October 2008, it was announced that all future England vs New Zealand rugby test matches will be played for the Hillary Shield named in honour of Sir Edmund. The shield was contested for the first time on 29 November 2008 at Twickenham Stadium, and was presented to the winning team, the New Zealand national rugby union team, by Lady Hillary.[110] Also on 23 October 2008 the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in New Zealand (formerly the Young New Zealanders' Challenge) was announced as the youth programme that would take Sir Edmund's name as part of its brand (at the request of the NZ Govt and the Hillary family). The organisation re-branded on 20 August 2009 as \\"The Duke of Edinburgh's Hillary Award\\".[111]\\r\\nOn 11 January 2009 at 9?am the New Zealand duo, \\"The Kiwis\\", performed their tribute song \\"Hillary 88\\" in front of the Beehive in Wellington. This has been recorded as the official world memorial song for Sir Edmund Hillary with the endorsement of Lady Hillary. The band members were Dean Ward and George Watson of Levin.[112]\\r\\nA four-day track in the Waitakere Ranges, along Auckland's west coast, is named the Hillary Trail,[113] in honour of Sir Edmund.[80] Hillary's father-in-law, Jim Rose, who had built a bach at Anawhata in 1925, wrote \\"My family look forward to the time when we will be able to walk from Huia to Muriwai on public walking tracks like the old-time Maori could do\\" in his 1982 history of Anawhata Beach.[81][114] Hillary loved the area, and had his own bach near Anawhata (see Personal life, above). He and his friend, former mayor Bob Harvey,[76] kept Rose's dream alive,[114] and the track was eventually opened on 11 January 2010, the second anniversary of Hillary's death.[89][115] Rose Track, descending from Anawhata Road to Whites Beach, is named after the Rose family.[82][116]\\r\\nThe South Ridge of Aoraki/Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest mountain, was renamed Hillary Ridge on 18 August 2011. Hillary and three other climbers were the first party to successfully climb the ridge in 1948.[117] In September 2013 the Government of Nepal proposed naming a 7,681 metres (25,200?ft) mountain in Nepal Hillary Peak in his honour.[118] After the New Horizons mission discovered a mountain range on Pluto on 14 July 2015, it was informally named Hillary Montes (Hillary Mountains) by NASA.[119]\\r\\nBooks written by Hillary include:","input":"Who was the first to climb mt everest?"},{"output":"Divya","context":"Varendra became free for a few years\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Varendra rebellion (also known as the Kaivarta revolt) means the revolt against King Mahipala II led by Divya.[1] It is known as not only the first successful rebellion of Bengal but also of Indian Subcontinent. The Kaivarta were able to capture Varendra by this rebellion. Later on, in 1082 CE, King Rampala was succeed to recapture his fatherland Varendra by defeating Vim with the assistance of neighboring vassals. Thus, the first revolt of rebellious Kaibarta came to an end.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kaivartas were mainly aboriginal fishermen tribal communities. They earned their livelihood by fishing from their ancestor. But as the Pala emperors were non-violent in their religious believes, they were against of eating fish and meat. So, they always tried to discourage Kaivartas from catching fishes. As a result, the Kaivartas were abused by the Pala emperors. Besides, King Mahipala II arrested his two brothers Shurapala II and Rampala II in the time of ascending the throne. As a result, some vassals of the two arrested brothers also took part in the rebellion.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pala dynasty is known as golden age of Bengal. But after the golden age of Dharmapala and Devpala, the Pala emperors started to lose their glory.[4] Their rule became weak and disorganization broke out. The principal aim of the rebellion was to bring back the maintenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said that the rebellion took place from 1075 - 1082 CE in the reign of Mahipala II and Rampala II.\\r\\n\\r\\nPala employee Divya called for revolution. The Kaivartas responded on his call and the rebels were easily able to capture the Varendra. As the Kaivartas were very expert in boating, they capitalized on naval war. Mahipala II was killed by the rebels and the Pala armies were forced to fall back. As a result, Varendra was declared a separate state by Divya. After the death of Divya, first Divya's brother Ruddoka and then Ruddoka's son Vima were declared king of Varendra. Vima established himself as a successful and expert ruler. Vima made the war-torn Varendra prosper. The Kaivarta pillar is still standing in Dinajpur of Bangladesh as a sign of the dynasty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing the prosperity of Varendra and popularity of Vima, Rampala became worried after ascending the throne. He was afraid of losing more of Pala territory. Because of this, he managed the neighboring vassals with a lot of money and property for assistance in the war. It was difficult for Vima and the newly formed state Varendra to defend against the large combined army of Rampala. He was imprisoned at the north shore of the Ganges river while fighting. The Pala armies looted the countless treasures of Varendra.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Vima was imprisoned, his faithful worker Hari reorganized the army and attacked Rampala again. When Hari was on the verge of victory, Rampala enchanted him with wealth. Thus, the dream of the liberty of Varendra was spoiled and Varendra was again part of the Pala empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaivarta leaders were punished so that the Kaivartas could not dare again to revolt. Vima's family was killed in front of Vima and later on, Vima was assassinated.","input":"Who was the leader of the kaivarta revolt?"},{"output":"a state college","context":"Miami Dade College, or simply Miami Dade or MDC, is a state college located in Miami, Florida. Miami Dade has eight campuses and twenty-one outreach centers located throughout Miami-Dade County. Founded in 1959, Miami Dade is the largest college in the Florida College System with over 165,000 students. Additionally, MDC is also the largest institution of higher education in Florida, and the second-largest in the United States. Miami Dade College's main campus, the Wolfson Campus, is in Downtown Miami.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiami Dade College was established in 1959 and opened in 1960 as Dade County Junior College. The original campus was located at the recently built Miami Central High School. The campus consisted of a portion of the school and an adjacent farm. In 1960, a facility was built on an old naval air station near Opa-locka Airport (known as Master Field), which would soon become the College's North Campus.[4] The College enrolled African American students and Cuban exiles who could not afford other schools, becoming Florida's first integrated junior college. As the college grew, a temporary satellite campus opened in what is today Pinecrest at Miami Palmetto High School until the new South Campus (later Kendall Campus) was built in Kendall. Later renamed Miami-Dade Junior College, its two flagship campuses expanded and enrolled more students, eventually outgrowing the University of Florida and Florida State University. After some time, college board of directors' chairman Mitchell Wolfson envisioned a campus at the heart of Downtown Miami, and in 1973, the Wolfson Campus was built. The College changed its name to Miami-Dade Community College around the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe College initially implemented an open admissions policy, meaning anyone who could afford classes was allowed to enroll. Because of this, the focus of the College became strengthening its academics. As a result, the Medical Center was built near Miami's Civic Center adjacent to the University of Miami Jackson Memorial Hospital to train students in Allied Health and nursing (RN) programs. With the Mariel exile community arriving in 1980, the College created an outreach center in Hialeah to give incoming refugees educational opportunities. Another outreach center, the InterAmerican center, was built to accommodate bilingual education. The Homestead Campus was built in 1990 in Homestead to relieve the concerns of students having to drive to the Kendall Campus In Miami.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-1990s, the College made use of new media and technologies under the direction of president Eduardo Padr܇n. As the Florida legislature reduced the education budget, the College began to rely heavily on the Miami Dade College Foundation, consisting mainly of Alumni, for financial support. The College also had to figure out new ways of recruiting students, and the College began its \\"Successful Alumni\\" campaign in the late 1990s, marketing the success of the College's alumni to local prospective students.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 2001, the College implemented a strategic plan to revamp the College and its recruiting goals. In 2002, the College disbanded its Honors Program and created The Honors College for talented high school graduates. The Honors College is a representation of Miami Dade College's most academically-gifted students in different fields and was originally based in the three larger campuses (Wolfson, Kendall, and North). In 2007, The Honors College expanded into the InterAmerican Campus with The Honors College Dual Language Honors Program. A vision of president Padr܇n and leading members of Miami Dade College, the aim of the program is to tailor to the needs of the growing Spanish-speaking population in the United States as well as abroad. The Dual Language Honors Program opened its doors to bilingual students who wish to continue their careers with professional fluency in the English and Spanish languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, the College was granted the right to award baccalaureate degrees in education to meet future education needs, and currently offers three bachelor's degrees. As a result, the College changed its name again from Miami-Dade Community College to Miami Dade College to reflect four-year degree possibilities. However, it is overwhelmingly a two-year college focused on awarding associate degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiami Dade College has seven campuses and two centers, with its main campus being the Wolfson Campus in Downtown Miami.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 6, 1960, 1,428 students enrolled in inaugural class of Miami Dade College. Known, at the time, as Dade County Junior College. The land used for the college was located on the site of Dade County School's former agricultural program, located next to Miami Central High. This area was composed of makeshift buildings, portables, and agricultural storehouses, which led to several nicknames for the college such as \\"Portable U.\\" and \\"Chicken Coop College.\\"\\r\\nEnrollment at the fledgling college continued to increase with each semester, which required the addition of more buildings to meet the college's growth.  One of these additions was the campus library. When it was first established, the library could only accommodate about 225 students, in accordance with regulations at the time (the library was required to be able to hold a third of the student population).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961, the school was given the opportunity to purchase 230 acres of surplus land, part of an old Marine-base that would become the new site for the college. During this time, the library was stationed in repurposed military buildings on the base. Though not perfect, it was an improvement over the library's previous location and, in 1964, while the college was going through the process of achieving full accreditation as a learning institution; the Florida Department of Education praised the college's library as the best junior college library in the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though the library received recognition during its early days, the collection still required at least 20,000 more volumes in order to meet library standards of the time. In 1965, construction of the new learning resource center (which would house the library) was completed. In 1968, due to continual increase in enrollment, Miami Dade College opened their new South Campus, which would serve as the location for centralized library acquisitions for the original Miami Dade North Campus and the new South Campus, located in Kendall.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 4, 1970, Miami Dade College welcomed its Downtown Campus, which originally held classes in nearby storefronts, churches, and apartment buildings.  An old pawnshop was remodeled into the Downtown Campus's college library, and housed the collection until the campus's new buildings were constructed. During the 1980s, as the college continued to grow and technology advanced, it was decided that all of Miami Dade College's libraries would move to an online, computerized circulation system.  With the creation of each new campus, Miami Dade College's libraries continued to play an important role in meeting the demands of an increasingly large number of students.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the college's early days in the 1960s, when the college first opened its doors to students, Miami Dade College continues to grow as a center for education and innovation in South Florida, establishing new campuses and library facilities. Miami Dade College is currently home to state-of-the art library facilities that highlight the use of adaptable resources to meet the needs of students, faculty, and staff. The Miami Dade College library system continues to evolve since it went into operation in the 1960s.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe College opened MDC-West in the Doral area on March 1, 2006.  The Hialeah Center has become a fully accredited campus, with possible future expansions considered critical.\\r\\n\\r\\nMDC also has a virtual college, where a degree can be attained completely over the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe College also hosts the School for Advanced Studies, or SAS, a limited admission opportunity for Miami-Dade Public School students. High school classes are held at Kendall, Wolfson, and North Campus alongside regular college credit courses, and students choose three college classes per semester to take in place of traditional high school electives. College books and tuition is paid for by the county, and there is no cost to students. Bus service is also provided throughout the county to the schools. The goal is to allow students to earn their Associate in Arts and Associate in Science degree while earning their high school diploma. SAS is the 15th best high school in the nation, and is repeatedly one of the highest ranking high schools.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of approximately 165,000 students, on average, almost 6,000 go on to earn baccalaureate degrees, A.A./A.S./A.A.S. degrees, vocational, technical and/or college credit certificates. Its student population is as diverse as Miami-Dade County. Associate in Arts transfer students from Miami Dade College go on to transfer primarily to schools within the State University System of Florida, though some do transfer to out-of-state institutions, mainly through articulation agreements made between institutions.  Students from its Honors College have been accepted at many prestigious institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe College faces an issue of limited funding, and is looking for ways to support current and future baccalaureate programs. Out of Florida's 28 community colleges, Miami Dade ranks among the lowest in receiving state aid.  To offset this, Dr. Padr܇n and other College officials have pushed for legislation that would allow Miami-Dade County to put forth a referendum for a 0.5% increase in Miami-Dade County sales tax.  This measure, Dr. Padr܇n believes, would allow the College to set aside some money into an investment fund for long-term facility maintenance and scholarships for students.  He also argues that tourists pay one-third of Miami-Dade's sales tax, and that the proposed tax increase would only be in effect for five years.  However, the legislation has not made it through the Florida Legislature.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiami Dade College operates seven campuses and various outreach centers located throughout Miami-Dade County. The Honors College is currently represented on four campuses, with a new bilingual program (English-Spanish) at the InterAmerican Campus.  All campuses have different schools for various disciplines (engineering, business, etc.). Some campuses also operate dual-enrollment programs for high school students. Most campuses also have College Preparatory or English as a Second Language (ESL) courses that help students pass the Computerized Placement Test (CPT) that is required for admittance and proves prospective students are qualified to take college-level mathematics and English courses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from New World School of the Arts and the MEEC, there are nineteen other outreach centers MDC administers.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe school's athletic teams compete in the Southern Conference of the Florida State College Activities Association, a body of the National Junior College Athletic Association Region 8.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiami Dade College has produced thousands of alumni over the years. Among the most notable alumni are U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the former City of Miami Mayor Manny Diaz, the former President of Texas A&M University Elsa Murano, the former President of Panama Mireya Moscoso, actor Steven Bauer, the award-winning novelist James Carlos Blake (who also taught at MDC Wolfson from 1984 to 1997), Major League Baseball outfielder Ra~l Iba?ez, former Major League Baseball catcher Mike Piazza, Cuban artist Agnes Chavez, and Harvard Law professor and defense attorney Jose Baez.

It stands 134 feet (41?m) tall and is capable of displaying a maximum temperature of 134?F (57?C), both of which are a reference to the temperature record.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was built in 1991 by the Young Electric Sign Company of Salt Lake City, Utah[1] for Willis Herron, a local Baker businessman who spent $700,000 to build the thermometer next to his Bun Boy restaurant. Its height -- 134 feet -- was in honor of the 134-degree record temperature set in nearby Death Valley on July 10, 1913.\\r\\nSoon after its construction, 70-mph winds snapped the thermometer in half, and it was rebuilt. Two years later, severe gusts made the thermometer sway so much that its light bulbs popped out. Concrete was then poured inside the steel core to reinforce the monument.\\r\\nHerron sold the attraction and restaurant to another local businessman, Larry Dabour, who sold it in 2005. In September 2012, the owner at that time, Matt Pike, said that the power bill for its operation had reached $8,000 per month and that he turned it off due to the poor economy.[2] In 2013, the thermometer and accompanying empty gift shop were listed for sale.[3] The family of Willis Herron (who died in 2007) recovered ownership of the property in 2014 and stated their intention to make it operational again.[4] The official re-lighting took place on July 10, 2014.[5]\\r\\nIn December 2016, eVgo announced building the first US fast charge station for electric vehicles at up to 350 kW.

The shortest distance across the strait, 33.3 kilometres (20.7 miles; 18.0 nautical miles), is from the South Foreland, northeast of Dover in the English county of Kent, to Cap Gris Nez, a cape near to Calais in the French dpartement of Pas-de-Calais. Between these points lies the most popular route for cross-channel swimmers.[1] The entire strait is within the territorial waters of France and the United Kingdom, but a right of transit passage under the UNCLOS exists allowing unrestricted shipping.[2][3][4]\\r\\nOn a clear day, it is possible to see the opposite coastline of England from France and vice versa with the naked eye, with the most famous and obvious sight being the white cliffs of Dover from the French coastline and shoreline buildings on both coastlines, as well as lights on either coastline at night, as in Matthew Arnold's poem \\"Dover Beach\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost maritime traffic between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea and Baltic Sea passes through the Strait of Dover, rather than taking the longer and more dangerous route around the north of Scotland. The strait is the busiest international seaway in the world, used by over 400 commercial vessels daily.[3] This has made traffic safety a critical issue, with HM Coastguard and the Maritime Gendarmerie maintaining a 24-hour watch over the strait and enforcing a strict regime of shipping lanes.[5]\\r\\nIn addition to the intensive eastÿwest traffic, the strait is crossed from north to south by ferries linking Dover to Calais and Dunkirk.[3] Until 1994 these provided the only route across it for land transport. The Channel Tunnel now provides an alternative route, crossing beneath the strait at an average depth of 45?m (148?ft) below the seabed.\\r\\nThe town of Dover gives its name to one of the sea areas of the British Shipping Forecast.\\r\\nThe strait is believed to have been created by the erosion of a land bridge that linked the Weald in Great Britain to the Boulonnais in the Pas de Calais. The predominant geology on both the British and French sides and on the seafloor is chalk. Although somewhat resistant to erosion, erosion of both coasts has created the famous white cliffs of Dover in the UK and the Cap Blanc Nez in France. The Channel Tunnel was bored through solid chalk.\\r\\nThe Rhine (as the Urstrom) flowed northwards into the North Sea as the sea level fell during the start of the first of the Pleistocene Ice Ages. The ice created a dam from Scandinavia to Scotland, and the Rhine, combined with the Thames and drainage from much of north Europe, created a vast lake behind the dam, which eventually spilled over the Weald into the English Channel. This overflow channel became the Strait of Dover about 425,000 years ago. A narrow deep channel along the middle of the strait was the bed of the Rhine in the last Ice Age. A geological deposit in East Anglia marks the old preglacial northward course of the Rhine.\\r\\nA 2007 study[6][7] concluded the English Channel was formed by erosion caused by two major floods. The first was about 425,000 years ago, when an ice-dammed lake in the southern North Sea overflowed and broke the Weald-Artois chalk range in a catastrophic erosion and flood event. Afterwards, the Thames and Scheldt flowed through the gap into the English Channel, but the Meuse and Rhine still flowed northwards. In a second flood about 225,000 years ago the Meuse and Rhine were ice-dammed into a lake that broke catastrophically through a high weak barrier (perhaps chalk, or an end-moraine left by the ice sheet). Both floods cut massive flood channels in the dry bed of the English Channel, somewhat like the Channeled Scablands or the Wabash River in the USA. A further update in 2017, attributed a series of previously described underwater holes in the Channel floor -\\"100m deep\\" and in places \\"several kilometres in diameter\\" to lake water plunging over a rock ridge causing isolated depressions or plunge pools.[8] The melting ice and rising sea levels submerged Doggerland, the area linking Britain to France 6,500ÿ6,200 BCE.\\r\\nThe Lobourg strait, a major feature of the strait's seafloor, runs its 6?km (4?mi) wide slash on a NNEÿSSW axis. Nearer to the French coast than to the English coast, it runs along the Varne sandbank where it plunges to 68?m (223?ft) at its deepest, and along the latter's south-east neighbour the Ridge bank (French name \\"Colbart\\"[9]) with a maximum depth of 62?m (203?ft).[10]\\r\\nThe submarine depth of the strait varies between 68?m (223?ft) at the Lobourg strait and 20?m (66?ft) at the highest banks. It presents a succession of rocky areas relatively deserted by ships wanting to spare their nets, and of sandy flats and sub-aqueous dunes. The strong currents of the Channel are slowed down around the rocky areas of the strait, with formation of countercurrents and calmer zones where many species can find shelter.[11] In these calmer zones, the water is clearer than in the rest of the strait; thus algae can grow despite the 30?m (98?ft) average depth and help increase diversity in the local species ÿ some of which are endemic to the strait. Moreover, this is a transition zone for the species of the Atlantic Ocean and those of the southern part of the North Sea.\\r\\nThis mix of various environments promotes a wide variety of wildlife.[12]\\r\\nThe Ridens de Boulogne, a 10ÿ20?m (33ÿ66?ft) deep[13] rocky high ground partially covered with sand located 15?nmi (28?km; 17?mi) to the west of Boulogne, boasts the highest production of maerl in the strait.[13]\\r\\nA 682?km2 (263?sq?mi) area of the strait is classified as a Natura 2000 protection zone listed under the name Ridens et dunes hydrauliques du Pas de Calais (Ridens and sub-aqueous dunes of the Dover Strait). This area includes the sub-aqueous dunes of Varne, Colbart, Vergoyer and Bassurelle, the Ridens de Boulogne, and the Lobourg channel which provides calmer and clearer waters due to its depth reaching 68?m (223?ft).[14]\\r\\nMany crossings other than in conventional vessels have been attempted, including by pedalo, jetpack, bathtub, amphibious vehicle and more commonly by swimming. French law bans many of these while English law does not, so most such crossings originate in England.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the late 17th century during the \\"Little Ice Age\\" there are reports of severe winter ice in the Strait of Dover, including a case in 1684 of only a league of open water remaining between Dover and Calais.[15]; see [1] for another report of severe ice in the English Channel.[16]","input":"What's the distance between england and france?"},{"output":"aye-aye","context":"","input":"What type of animal is maurice from madagascar?"},{"output":"second millennium BCE","context":"","input":"When did the chinese first use fingerprint as identification?"},{"output":"May 12 and 13, 1865","context":"The Battle of Palmito Ranch is considered by some criteria as the final battle of the American Civil War. It was fought May 12 and 13, 1865, on the banks of the Rio Grande east of Brownsville, Texas and a few miles from the seaport of Los Brazos de Santiago. Since the Confederacy had ceased to exist, it is also argued that this battle should be classified as a postwar action.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion and Confederate forces in southern Texas had been observing an unofficial truce since the beginning of 1865. But Union Colonel Theodore H. Barrett, newly assigned to command an all-black unit, and never having been in combat, ordered an attack on a Confederate camp near Fort Brown for unknown reasons. The Union attackers captured a few prisoners, but the following day the attack was repulsed near Palmito Ranch by Colonel John Salmon Ford, and the battle resulted in a Union defeat. Union forces were surprised by artillery, said to have been supplied by the French Army occupying the nearby Mexican town of Matamoros. \\r\\n\\r\\nCasualty estimates are not dependable, but Union Private John J. Williams of the 34th Indiana Infantry Regiment is believed to have been the last man killed in this engagement. He could then arguably be reckoned as the last man killed in the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engagement is also known as the Battle of Palmito Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter July 27, 1864, the Union Army withdrew most of the 6,500 troops deployed to the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, which they had occupied since November 2, 1863. The Confederates were determined to protect their remaining ports, which were essential for cotton sales to Europe and the importation of supplies. The Mexicans across the border tended to side with the Confederates because of the lucrative smuggling trade.[1] Beginning in early 1865, the rival armies in south Texas honored a gentlemen's agreement, as they saw no point in further hostilities between them.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion Major General Lew Wallace proposed a negotiated end of hostilities in Texas to Confederate Brigadier General James E. Slaughter, and met with Slaughter and his subordinate Colonel Ford at Port Isabel on March 11ÿ12, 1865.[3] Despite Slaughter's and Ford's agreement that combat would prove tragic, Slaughter's superior, Confederate Maj. Gen. John G. Walker, rejected the ceasefire in a scathing exchange of letters with Wallace. Despite this, both sides honored a tacit agreement not to advance on the other without prior written notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nA brigade of 1,900 Union troops commanded by Col. Robert B. Jones of the 34th Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry were on blockade duty at the Port of Brazos Santiago at the mouth of the present-day ship channel of the Port of Brownsville. The 400-man 34th Indiana was an experienced regiment that had served in the Vicksburg Campaign and was reorganized in December 1863 as a \\"Veteran\\" regiment, composed entirely of veterans from several other regiments whose original enlistments had expired. The 34th Indiana deployed to Los Brazos de Santiago on December 22, 1864, replacing the 91st Illinois Volunteer Infantry, which returned to New Orleans. The brigade also included the 87th and 62nd United States Colored Infantry Regiments (\\"United States Colored Troops\\", or U.S.C.T.) which had a combined strength of about 1,100. Shortly after Gen. Walker rejected the armistice proposal, Col. Jones resigned from the army to return to Indiana. He was replaced in the regiment by Lt. Col. Robert G. Morrison and at Los Brazos de Santiago by Colonel Theodore H. Barrett, commander of the 62nd U.S.C.T.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 30-year-old Barrett had been an army officer since 1862, but he had yet to see combat. Anxious for higher rank, he volunteered for the newly raised \\"colored\\" regiments and was appointed in 1863 as colonel of the 1st Missouri Colored Infantry. In March 1864, the regiment became the 62nd U.S.C.T. Barrett contracted malaria in Louisiana that summer, and while he was on convalescent leave, the 62nd was posted to Brazos Santiago. He joined it there in February 1865.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians still debate why this engagement at Palmito Ranch took place. Lee had surrendered to Grant in Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, triggering a series of formal surrenders in other places throughout the country. The Confederate and Union officers in Brownsville also knew that Lee had surrendered, effectively ending the war. \\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after the battle, Barrett's detractors claimed he desired \\"a little battlefield glory before the war ended altogether.\\"[2] Others have suggested that Barrett needed horses for the 300 unmounted cavalrymen in his brigade and decided to take them from his enemy.[4] Louis J. Schuler, in his 1960 pamphlet \\"The last battle in the War Between the States, May 13, 1865: Confederate Force of 300 defeats 1,700 Federals near Brownsville, Texas\\", asserts that Brig. Gen. Egbert B. Brown of the U.S. Volunteers had ordered the expedition to seize as contraband 2,000 bales of cotton stored in Brownsville and sell them for his own profit.[5] But Brown was not even appointed to command at Brazos Santiago until later in May.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to historian Jerry Thompson:\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion Lieutenant Colonel David Branson wanted to attack the Confederate encampments commanded by Ford at White and Palmito ranches near Fort Brown outside Brownsville. Branson's Union forces consisted of 250 men of the 62nd U.S.C.T. in eight companies and two companies of the (U.S.) 2nd Texas Cavalry Battalion. The 300-man 2nd Texas, like the earlier-formed 1st Texas Cavalry Regiment, was composed largely of Texans of Mexican origin who remained loyal to the United States.[8] They moved from Brazos Santiago to the mainland. At first Branson's expedition was successful, capturing three prisoners and some supplies, although it failed to achieve the desired surprise.[9] During the afternoon, Confederate forces under Captain William N. Robinson counterattacked with less than 100 cavalry, driving Branson back to White's Ranch, where the fighting stopped for the night. Both sides sent for reinforcements; Ford arrived with six French guns and the remainder of his cavalry force (for a total of 300 men), while Barrett came with 200 troops of the 34th Indiana in nine under-strength companies.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, Barrett started advancing westward, passing a half-mile to the west of Palmito Ranch, with skirmishers from the 34th Indiana deployed in advance.[12] Ford attacked Barrett's force as it was skirmishing with an advance Confederate force along the Rio Grande about 4 p.m. He sent a couple of companies with artillery to attack the Union right flank and the remainder of his force into a frontal attack. After some confusion and fierce fighting, the Union forces retreated toward Boca Chica. Barrett attempted to form a rearguard, but Confederate artillery prevented him from rallying a force sufficient to do so.[13] During the retreat, which lasted until 14 May, 50 members of the 34th Indiana's rearguard company, 30 stragglers, and 20 of the dismounted cavalry were surrounded in a bend of the Rio Grande and captured.[14] The battle is recorded as a Confederate victory.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFighting in the battle involved Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, and Native American troops. Reports of shots from the Mexican side, the sounding of a warning to the Confederates of the Union approach, the crossing of Imperial cavalry into Texas, and the participation by several among Ford's troops are unverified, despite many witnesses reporting shooting from the Mexican shore.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Barrett's official report of August 10, 1865, he reported 115 Union casualties: one killed, nine wounded, and 105 captured.[16] Confederate casualties were reported as five or six wounded, with none killed.[17] Historian and Ford biographer Stephen B. Oates, however, concludes that Union deaths were much higher, probably around 30, many of whom drowned in the Rio Grande or were attacked by French border guards on the Mexican side. He likewise estimated Confederate casualties at approximately the same number.[5][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing court-martial testimony and post returns from Brazos Santiago, historian Jerry D. Thompson of Texas A&M International University determined that:\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate John J. Williams[20] of the 34th Indiana was the last fatality during the Battle at Palmito Ranch, likely making him the final combat death of the entire war.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Jefferson Davis was captured and imprisoned on May 10, 1865, marking the effective end of the Confederate government. In addition, that day President Andrew Johnson declared \\"armed resistance ...virtually at an end.\\"[22] Historian James McPherson joins other historians in concluding that the war ended when the government ended. \\r\\n\\r\\nConfederate General Edmund Kirby Smith officially surrendered all Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi Department on June 2, 1865, except those under the command of Brigadier General Chief Stand Watie in the Indian Territory.[23] Stand Watie, of the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles, on June 23, 1865, became the last Confederate general to surrender his forces, in Doaksville, Indian Territory.[24] On that same day, President Andrew Johnson ended the Union blockade of the Southern states.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany senior Confederate commanders in Texas (including Smith, Walker, Slaughter, and Ford) and many troops with their equipment fled across the border to Mexico. Wanting to resist capture, they may also have intended to ally with French Imperial forces, or with Mexican forces under deposed President Benito Jurez.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Military Division of the Southwest (after June 27 the Division of the Gulf), commanded by Maj. Gen. Phillip H. Sheridan, occupied Texas between June and August. Consisting of the IV Corps, XIII Corps, the African-American XXV Corps, and two 4,000-man cavalry divisions commanded by Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt and Maj. Gen. George A. Custer, it aggregated a 50,000-man force on the Gulf Coast and along the Rio Grande to pressure the French intervention in Mexico and garrison the Reconstruction Department of Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1865, Barrett preferred charges of disobedience of orders, neglect of duty, abandoning his colors, and conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline against Morrison for actions in the battle, resulting in the latter's court martial. Confederate Col. Ford, who had returned from Mexico at the request of Union Gen. Frederick Steele to act as parole commissioner for disbanding Confederate forces, appeared as a defense witness and assisted in absolving Morrison of responsibility for the defeat at Palmito Ranch.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of this engagement provides accounts of the roles of Hispanic Confederate veterans and of the treatment by Confederates in South Texas of black prisoners-of-war. Hispanic Confederates served at Fort Brown in Brownsville and on the field of Palmito Ranch. Col. Santos Benavides, who was the highest-ranking Hispanic in either army, led between 100 and 150 Hispanic soldiers in the Brownsville Campaign in May 1865.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the Sixty-Second Colored Regiment were also taken [in the Battle of Palmito Ranch]. They had been led to believe that if captured they would either be shot or returned to slavery. They were agreeably surprised when they were paroled and permitted to depart with the white prisoners. Several of the prisoners were from Austin and vicinity. They were assured they would be treated as prisoners of war. There was no disposition to visit upon them a mean spirit of revenge.[27]\\r\\nWhen Colonel Ford surrendered his command following the campaign of Palmito Ranch, he urged his men to honor their paroles. He insisted that \\"The negro had a right to vote.\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough officially most historians say this was the last land action fought between the North and the South, some sources suggest that the battle on 19 May 1865 of Hobdy's Bridge, located near Eufaula in Alabama, was the last skirmish between the two forces. Union records show that the last Northern soldier killed in combat during the war was Corporal John W. Skinner in this action. Three others were wounded, also from the same unit, Company C, 1st Florida U.S. Cavalry.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorian Richard Gardiner stated in 2013 that on 10 May 1865:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Confederates won this engagement, but as there was no organized command structure, there has been controversy about the Union casualties. In 1896 these same men had their pensions cut, although this was quickly rectified by an appeal to the commissioner of pensions. The assistant secretary to the commissioner overturned the pension cut, legally ruling the men as the last Union casualties of the war.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 2, 1866, President Johnson declared the insurrection at an end, except in Texas. There a technicality concerning incomplete formation of a new state government prevented declaring the insurrection over.[24] Johnson declared the insurrection at an end in Texas and throughout the United States on August 20, 1866.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area has remained relatively unchanged, with the marshy, windswept prairies almost the same as they were in 1865. The site is more than 5,400 acres (2,200?ha) in size, and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1997. The area is indicated by a large highway marker telling the history of the engagement, installed on the \\"Boca Chica Highway\\" (Texas State Highway 4) near where Palmito Ranch originally stood. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved 3 acres (0.012?km2) of the battlefield.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\n{reflist}","input":"When did the battle of palmito ranch happen?"},{"output":"African bush elephant","context":"The largest organisms found on Earth can be determined according to various aspects of an organism's size, such as: mass, volume, area, length, height, or even genome size. Some organisms group together to form a superorganism (such as ants or bees), but such are not classed as single large organisms. The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest structure composed of living entities, stretching 2,000?km (1,200?mi), but contains many organisms of many types of species.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article lists the largest species for various types of organisms, and mostly considers extant species. The organism sizes listed are frequently considered \\"outsized\\" and are not in the normal size range for the respective group.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf considered singular entities, the largest organisms are clonal colonies which can spread over large areas. Pando, a clonal colony of the quaking aspen tree, is widely considered to be the largest such organism by mass.[1] Even if such colonies are excluded, trees retain their dominance of this listing, with the giant sequoia being the most massive tree.[2] In 2006 a huge clonal colony of Posidonia oceanica was discovered south of the island of Ibiza. At 8 kilometres (5?mi) across, and estimated at around 100,000 years old,[3] it may be one of the largest and oldest clonal colonies on Earth.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong animals, the largest species are all marine mammals, specifically whales. The blue whale is believed to be the largest animal to have ever lived. The largest land animal classification is also dominated by mammals, with the African bush elephant being the most massive of these.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest single-stem tree by wood volume and mass is the giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), native to Sierra Nevada and California; it typically grows to a height of 70ÿ85?m (230ÿ280?ft) and 5ÿ7?m (16ÿ23?ft) in diameter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple-stem trees such as banyan can be enormous. Thimmamma Marrimanu in India spreads over 1.0?ha (2.5 acres).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest organism in the world, according to mass, is the aspen tree whose colonies of clones can grow up to five miles long. The largest such colony is Pando, in the Fishlake National Forest in Utah.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother form of flowering plant that rivals Pando as the largest organism on earth in breadth, if not mass, is the giant marine plant, Posidonia oceanica, discovered in the Mediterranean near the Balearic Islands, Spain. Its length is about 8?km (5?mi). It may also be the oldest living organism in the world, with an estimated age of 100,000 years.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen algae are photosynthetic unicellular and multicellular protists that are related to land plants. The thallus of the unicellular mermaid's wineglass, Acetabularia, can grow to several inches (perhaps 0.1 to 0.2 m) in length. The fronds of the similarly unicellular, and invasive Caulerpa taxifolia can grow up to a foot (0.3 m) long.\\r\\n\\r\\nA member of the order Cetacea, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), is thought to be the largest animal ever to have lived. The maximum recorded weight was 190 metric tonnes for a specimen measuring 27.6 metres (91?ft), whereas longer ones, up to 33.6 metres (110?ft), have been recorded but not weighed.[8][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), of the order Proboscidea, is the largest living land animal. A native of various open habitats in sub-Saharan Africa, this elephant is commonly born weighing about 100 kilograms (220?lb).[11] The largest elephant ever recorded was shot in Angola in 1974. It was a male measuring 10.67 metres (35.0?ft) from trunk to tail and 4.17 metres (13.7?ft) lying on its side in a projected line from the highest point of the shoulder to the base of the forefoot, indicating a standing shoulder height of 3.96 metres (13.0?ft). This male had an computed weight of 12.25 tonnes.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heaviest living animals are all cetaceans, and thus also the largest living mammals. Since no scale can accommodate the whole body of a large whale, most whales have been weighed by parts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of the heaviest wild land animals, which are all mammals. The African elephant is now listed as two species, the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant, as they are now generally considered to be two separate species.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest tunicates are Synoicum pulmonaria, found at depths of 20 and 40 metres (66 and 131?ft), and are up to 14 centimetres (6?in) in diameter. It is also present in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, around the coasts of Greenland and Newfoundland, but is less common here than in the east, and occurs only at depths between 10 and 13 metres (33 and 43?ft).[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest lancelets: European lancelet (Branchiostoma lanceolatum) \\"primitive fish\\". It can grow up to 6?cm (2.5?in) long.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blue whale is the largest mammal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest land mammal extant today is the African bush elephant. The largest extinct land mammal known was long considered to be Paraceratherium orgosensis, a rhinoceros relative thought to have stood up to 4.8?m (15.7?ft) tall, measured over 7.4?m (24.3?ft) long and may have weighed about 17 tonnes.[63][64] In 2015, a study suggested that one example of the proboscidean Palaeoloxodon namadicus may have been the largest land mammal ever, based on extensive research of fragmentary leg bone fossils from one individual, with a maximum estimated size of 22 tonnes.[65][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Permian era Cotylorhynchus, from what is now the southern United States, probably was the largest of all synapsids (most of which became extinct 250 million years ago), at 6?m (20?ft) and 2 tonnes.[66] The largest carnivorous synapsid was Anteosaurus from what is now South Africa during Middle Permian era. Anteosaurus was 5ÿ6?m (16ÿ20?ft) long, and weighed about 500ÿ600?kg (1,100ÿ1,300?lb).[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest living reptile, a representative of the order Crocodilia, is the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) of Southern Asia and Australia, with adult males being typically 3.9ÿ5.5?m (13ÿ18?ft) long. The largest confirmed saltwater crocodile on record was 6.32?m (20.7?ft) long, and weighed about 1,360?kg (3,000?lb).[8] Unconfirmed reports of much larger crocodiles exist, but examinations of incomplete remains have never suggested a length greater than 7?m (23?ft).[70] Also, a living specimen estimated at 7?m (23?ft) and 2,000?kg (4,400?lb) has been accepted by the Guinness Book of World Records.[71] However, due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a very large living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions has yet to be verified. A specimen named Lolong caught alive in the Philippines in 2011 (died February 2013) was found to have measured 6.17?m (20.2?ft) in length.[72][73][74][75][76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the \\"Komodo monitor\\", is a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, Nusa kode and Padar. A member of the monitor lizard family (Varanidae), it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 metres (9.8 feet) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 70 kilograms (150 pounds).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of the heaviest living reptile species ranked by average weight, which is dominated by the crocodilians. Unlike mammals, birds, or fish, the mass of large reptiles is frequently poorly documented and many are subject to conjecture and estimation.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest living bird, a member of the Struthioniformes, is the common ostrich (Struthio camelus), from the plains of Africa and Arabia. A large male ostrich can reach a height of 2.8?m (9.2?ft) and weigh over 156?kg (344?lb).[142] A mass of 200?kg (440?lb) has been cited for the common ostrich but no wild ostriches of this weight have been verified.[143] Eggs laid by the ostrich can weigh 1.4?kg (3.1?lb) and are the largest eggs in the world today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest bird in the fossil record may be the extinct elephant birds (Aepyornis) of Madagascar, which were related to the ostrich. They exceeded 3?m (9.8?ft) in height and 500?kg (1,100?lb).[8] The last of the elephant birds became extinct about 300 years ago. Of almost exactly the same upper proportions as the largest elephant birds was Dromornis stirtoni of Australia, part of a 26,000-year-old group called mihirungs of the family Dromornithidae.[144] The largest carnivorous bird was Brontornis, an extinct flightless bird from South America which reached a weight of 350 to 400?kg (770 to 880?lb) and a height of about 2.8?m (9?ft 2?in).[145] The tallest carnivorous bird was Kelenken, which could reach 3 to 3.2 meters in height and 220 to 250 kilograms. The tallest bird ever was the giant moa (Dinornis maximus), part of the moa family of New Zealand that went extinct around 1500 AD. This particular species of moa stood up to 3.7?m (12?ft) tall,[142] but weighed about half as much as a large elephant bird or mihirung due to its comparatively slender frame.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heaviest bird ever capable of flight was Argentavis magnificens, the largest member of the now extinct family Teratornithidae, found in Miocene-aged fossil beds of Argentina, with a wingspan up to 5.5?m (18?ft), a length of up to 1.25?m (4.1?ft), a height on the ground of up to 1.75?m (5.7?ft) and a body weight of at least 71?kg (157?lb).[8][146][147] Pelagornis sandersi is thought to have had an even larger wingspan of about 6.1ÿ7.4?m (20ÿ24?ft), but is only about 22ÿ40?kg (49ÿ88?lb), half the mass of the former.[148][147]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of the heaviest living bird species based on maximum reported or reliable mass, but average weight is also given for comparison. These species are almost all flightless, which allows for these particular birds to have denser bones and heavier bodies. Flightless birds comprise less than 2% of all living bird species.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest living amphibian is the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus). The maximum size of this nearly human-sized river-dweller is 64?kg (141?lb) and almost 1.83?m (6.0?ft).[8] Before amniotes became the dominant tetrapods, several giant amphibian proto-tetrapods existed and were certainly the dominant animals in their ecosystems. The largest known was the crocodile-like Prionosuchus, which reached a length of 9?m (30?ft).[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest known species of sea sponge is the giant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta. These massively built sponges can reach 2.4?m (8?ft) in height and can be of about the same number of feet across at the thickest part of the \\"body\\".[167] Some of these creatures have been estimated to be over 2,400 years of age.[168]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) is the largest cnidaria species, of the class Scyphozoa. The largest known specimen of this giant, found washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870,[170][171] had a bell diameter of 2.5?m (8.2?ft), a weight of 150?kg (330?lb). The tentacles of this specimens were as long as 37?m (121?ft) and were projected to have a tentacular spread of about 75?m (246?ft) making it one of the longest extant animals.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest roundworm, Placentonema gigantissima,[180] is a parasite found in the placentas of sperm whales which can reach up to 9?m (30?ft) in length.[181]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest of the segmented worms (commonly called earthworms) is the African giant earthworm (Microchaetus rappi). Although it averages about 1.36?m (4.5?ft) in length, this huge worm can reach a length of as much as 6.7?m (22?ft) and can weigh over 1.5?kg (3.3?lb).[182] Only the giant Gippsland earthworm, Megascolides australis, and a few giant polychaetes, including the notorious Eunice aphroditois, reach nearly comparable sizes, reaching 4 and 3.6?m (13 and 12?ft), respectively.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest species of echinoderm in terms of bulk is probably the starfish species Thromidia gigas, of the class Asteroidea, which reaches a weight of over 6?kg (13?lb),[183] but it might be beaten by some giant sea cucumbers such as Thelenota anax. However, at a maximum span of 63?cm (25?in), Thromidia gigas is quite a bit shorter than some other echinoderms.[8] The longest echinoderm known is the conspicuous sea cucumber Synapta maculata, with a slender body that can extend up to 3?m (9.8?ft). In comparison, the biggest sea star is the brisingid sea star Midgardia xandaros, reaching a span of 1.4?m (4.6?ft), despite being quite slender.[8] Evasterias echinosoma is another giant echinoderm and can measure up to 1?m (3.3?ft) across and weigh 5.1?kg (11?lb).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest nemertean is the bootlace worm, Lineus longissimus. A specimen found washed ashore on a beach in St. Andrews, Scotland in 1864 was recorded at a length of 55?m (180?ft).[189]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the largest mollusks and the largest of all invertebrates (in terms of mass) are the largest squids. The colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni) is projected to be the largest invertebrate.[190] Current estimates put its maximum size at 12 to 14?m (39 to 46?ft) long and 750?kg (1,650?lb),[191] based on analysis of smaller specimens. In 2007, authorities in New Zealand announced the capture of the largest known colossal squid specimen. It was initially thought to be 10?m (33?ft) and 450?kg (990?lb). It was later measured at 4.2?m (14?ft) long and 495?kg (1,091?lb) in weight.[192] The mantle was 2.5?m (8.2?ft) long when measured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe giant squid (Architeuthis dux) was previously thought to be the largest squid, and while it is less massive and has a smaller mantle than the colossal squid, it may exceed the colossal squid in overall length including tentacles. One giant squid specimen that washed ashore in 1878 in Newfoundland reportedly measured 18?m (59?ft) in total length (from the tip of the mantle to the end of the long tentacles), head and body length 6.1?m (20?ft), 4.6?m (15?ft) in diameter at the thickest part of mantle, and weighed about 900?kg (2,000?lb). This specimen is still often cited as the largest invertebrate that has ever been examined.[8][193][194] However, no animals approaching this size have been scientifically documented and, according to giant squid expert Steve O'Shea, such lengths were likely achieved by greatly stretching the two tentacles like elastic bands.[195]\\r\\n\\r\\nSol܇rzano's velvet worm (Peripatus solorzanoi) is the largest velvet worm known. An adult female was recorded to have a body length of 22?cm (approximately 8.7 in).[203]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest arthropod known to have existed is the eurypterid (sea scorpion) Jaekelopterus, reaching up to 2.5?m (8.2?ft) in body length, followed by the millipede relative Arthropleura at around 2.1?m (6.9?ft) in length.[204] Among living arthropods, the Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi) is the largest in overall size, the record specimen, caught in 1921, had an extended arm span of 3.8?m (12?ft) and weighed about 19?kg (42?lb).[8] The heaviest is the American lobster (Homarus americanus), the largest verified specimen, caught in 1977 off of Nova Scotia weighed 20?kg (44?lb) and its body length was 1.1?m (3.6?ft).[8] The largest land arthropod and the largest land invertebrate is the coconut crab (Birgus latro), up to 40?cm (1.3?ft) long and weighing up to 4?kg (8.8?lb) on average. Its legs may span 1?m (3.3?ft).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nInsects, a class of Arthropoda, are easily the most numerous class of organisms, with over one million identified species, and probably many undescribed species. The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of beetle, which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms. Although heavyweight giant wetas (Deinacrida heteracantha) are known, the elephant beetles of Central and South America, (Megasoma elephas) and (M. actaeon), the Titan beetle (Titanus giganteus) of the neotropical rainforests or the Goliath beetles, (Goliathus goliatus) and (G. regius), of Africa's rainforests are thought to reach a higher weight.[227] The most frequently crowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least 100?g (3.5?oz) and 11.5?cm (4.5?in).[8] The elephant beetles and titan beetle can reach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to 13.1 and 15.2?cm (5.2 and 6.0?in), respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns. The Goliath beetle's wingspan can range up to 25?cm (9.8?in).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome moths and butterflies have much larger areas than the heaviest beetles, but weigh a fraction as much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe longest insects are the stick insects, see below.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepresentatives of the extinct dragonfly-like order Protodonata such as the Carboniferous Meganeura monyi of what is now France and the Permian Meganeuropsis permiana of what is now North America are the largest insect species yet known to have existed. These creatures had a wingspan of some 75?cm (30?in) and a mass of over 1 pound (450?g), making them about the size of a crow.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest living fungus may be a honey fungus[261] of the species Armillaria ostoyae.[262]\\r\\nA mushroom of this type in the Malheur National Forest in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon, U.S. was found to be the largest fungal colony in the world, spanning 8.9?km2 (2,200 acres) of area.[263][264] This organism is estimated to be 2,400 years old. The fungus was written about in the April 2003 issue of the Canadian Journal of Forest Research. While an accurate estimate has not been made, the total weight of the colony may be as much as 605 tons[vague]. If this colony is considered a single organism, then it is the largest known organism in the world by area, and rivals the aspen grove \\"Pando\\" as the known organism with the highest living biomass. It is not known, however, whether it is a single organism with all parts of the mycelium connected.[264]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Armillaria ostoyae, each individual mushroom (the fruiting body, similar to a flower on a plant) has only a 5?cm (2.0?in) stipe, and a pileus up to 12.5?cm (4.9?in) across. There are many other fungi which produce a larger individual size mushroom. The largest known fruiting body of a fungus is a specimen of Phellinus ellipsoideus (formerly Fomitiporia ellipsoidea) found on Hainan Island.[265] The fruiting body masses up to 500?kg (1,100?lb).[266][267]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil P. ellipsoideus replaced it, the largest individual fruit body came from Rigidoporus ulmarius. R. ulmarius can grow up to 284?kg (626?lb), 1.66?m (5.4?ft) tall, 1.46?m (4.8?ft) across, and has a circumference of up to 4.9?m (16?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\n(Note: the group Protista is not used in current taxonomy.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest known species of bacterium is Thiomargarita namibiensis, which grows to 0.75?mm (0.030?in) in diameter, making it visible to the naked eye and a thousand times the size of more typical bacteria.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest virus on record so far is the Pithovirus sibericum with the length of 1.5 micrometres, comparable to the typical size of a bacterium and large enough to be seen in light microscopes. It was discovered in March 2014 in a soil sample collected from a riverbank in Siberia.

Named after Saint Louis of Anjou, the bishop of Toulouse, the mission is the namesake of the city of San Luis Obispo and San Luis Obispo County.\\r\\nThe Mission church of San Luis Obispo is unusual in its design in that its combination of belfry and vestibule is found nowhere else among the California missions. The main nave is short and narrow (as is the case with other mission churches), but at San Luis Obispo there is a secondary nave of almost equal size situated to the right of the altar, making this the only L-shaped mission church among all of the California missions. The mission church today is a parish church of the Diocese of Monterey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1769, a Spanish Expedition led by Gaspar de Portol, on a journey north from San Diego to find the Bay of Monterey described in 1602 by Sebastian Vizcaino, became the first Europeans to see the San Luis Obispo area.[10] Expedition diarist and Franciscan missionary Juan Cresp wrote that the soldiers called the place la Ca?ada de Los Osos (\\"Valley of the Bears\\").[4] Portola followed the same route the following year, on his way to establish the Presidio of Monterey. Missionary president Junpero Serra, traveling by sea, met the Portola party there and founded Carmel Mission.\\r\\nIn September 1, 1772, when food supplies started to dwindle at the mission, Serra remembered the stories of the \\"Valley of the Bears.\\" He decided to send a hunting expedition to kill the bears in order to feed the Spanish and the neophytes (natives that converted to Christianity) in Monterey. The huge success of the hunting expedition caused Father Junpero Serra to consider building a mission in that area. Upon further investigation, he was convinced that San Luis Obispo would be a perfect site for a mission based on its surplus of natural resources, good weather and the Chumash, a local friendly Indian tribe who could provide the labor for constructing the mission. The mission became the fifth in the mission chain founded by Father Junpero Serra.[11]\\r\\nFather Serra sent an expedition down south to San Luis Obispo to start building the mission. On September 1, 1772, a cross was erected near San Luis Obispo Creek and Father Junpero Serra celebrated the first mass, marking the site as the destination for yet another mission. However, briefly following the first mass, Father Junpero Serra returned to San Diego and left the responsibility of the mission's construction to Father Jose Cavaller. Father Cavaller, five soldiers, and two neophytes began building what is now Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa. Father Cavaller received help in the building of the Mission from the local friendly tribe, the Chumash Indians. The Chumash helped construct palisades, which would serve as temporary buildings for the Mission. However, due to several Indian tribes which were determined to get rid of European settlers, they set these buildings ablaze. Because of this, Father Cavaller was forced to rebuild the buildings using adobe and tile structures.[12]\\r\\nStarting in 1794 Mission San Luis Obispo went through extensive building operations.[12] They helped build numerous buildings to accommodate the nearby Indians. They also made many improvements and additions to the Mission. The renovation was finally finished when they completed the quadrangle in 1819, celebrated a year later by the arrival of two mission bells from Lima, Peru.[10] The arrival of the bells marked the end of improvements made to Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa for many years.[11] In 1830 Fr. Luis Gil y Taboada took over the mission, but he died three years later. Then in 1842 the death of Fr. Ramon Abella marked the last Franciscan at the mission.[11]\\r\\nIn 1845, Governor Po Pico with the declared the Mission buildings for sale and he sold everything except the church for a total of $510. John C. Frmont and his \\"California Battalion\\" used the Mission as a base of operations during their war with Mexico in 1846 (see Bear Flag Revolt). The Mission fell into ruins during the period of secularization and the priests who were left would rent out rooms to help support the Mission. The Mission San Lus Obispo de Tolosa became the first courthouse and jail in San Luis Obispo County, California. In 1872, during the 100th anniversary of the Mission, improvements began, but real restoration did not begin until 1933. The Mission is still the center of the busy downtown area, and functions as a Roman Catholic parish church for the City of San Luis Obispo in the Diocese of Monterey. Although many changes have come to the Mission, it remains the center of town. In 1970 the Mission was recognized as the center of the City of San Luis Obispo, with the dedication of Mission Plaza.[11]\\r\\nIn 1602, the Spanish began to show interest in California and sent Sebastin Vizcano, a pearl fisher, to explore the area. Vizcaino traveled the coast naming many of the cities that are important to the California coast today such as San Diego, Santa Barbara and Monterey. Spain finally chose to create Vizcaino's suggested chain of missions when it was proven that California was indeed part of the continent. The goal of creating the chain was given to the Franciscan Order. While Spain had economic motives for establishing a stronghold in California, the Franciscan order of the Catholic Church also had religious motives.[13] With these factors in mind the missions were created in order to control the coast so that the ships from Spain would remain safe as well as bring the Natives to the Catholic faith. Re-education became the method for reaching Spain's religious and economic goals as they strived to convert the Indians to Catholicism as well as make them loyal Spanish subjects.\\r\\nTo accomplish these goals the Spaniards had to convince the Indians that the Catholic faith was better than their own and had much more to offer them. Once an Indian decided to convert to the Catholic faith he was baptized and became a neophyte. Once a neophyte, the Indian lived in the Mission and attended masses regularly. The Spaniards taught the new neophytes more in depth aspects of the Catholic faith and introduced them to the European lifestyle.[13] As a part of mission life the Indians were taught Spanish and Latin for services, how to read music, sing as well as how to be skilled weavers, seamstresses, carpenters, tile makers, farmers and cattle herders. These lessons prepared the Indians to be a part of the Church as well as of the self-sustaining community of the mission where everyone contributed work to the success of the mission.","input":"When was mission san luis obispo de tolosa built?"},{"output":"Seven","context":"Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled from antiquity to the present day, to catalogue the world's most spectacular natural wonders and manmade structures.\\r\\nThe Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the first known list of the most remarkable creations of classical antiquity; it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers and only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim and in Mesopotamia. The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, and because it was the number of the five planets known anciently, plus the sun and moon.[1] Many similar lists have been made.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe historian Herodotus (484 ÿ ca. 425 BC) and the scholar Callimachus of Cyrene (ca. 305ÿ240 BC), at the Museum of Alexandria, made early lists of seven wonders.

Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).[1] As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated. Espresso is also the base for other drinks such as a caff latte, cappuccino, caff macchiato, caff mocha, flat white, or caff Americano.\\r\\n\\r\\nEspresso has more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, but because the usual serving size is much smaller, the total caffeine content is less than a mug of standard brewed coffee, contrary to a common belief.[2] Although the actual caffeine content of any coffee drink varies by size, bean origin, roast method and other factors, the caffeine content of typical servings of espresso vs. drip brew are 120 to 170?mg[3] vs. 150 to 200?mg.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nEspresso is made by forcing very hot water under high pressure through finely ground compacted coffee. Tamping down the coffee promotes the water's even penetration through the grounds.[6] This process produces an almost syrupy beverage by extracting both solid and dissolved components. The crema[7][8] is produced by emulsifying the oils in the ground coffee into a colloid, which does not occur in other brewing methods. There is no universal standard defining the process of extracting espresso,[9] but there are several published definitions which attempt to place constraints on the amount and type of ground coffee used, the temperature and pressure of the water, and the rate of extraction.[10][11] Generally, one uses an espresso machine to make espresso.   The act of producing a shot of espresso is often termed \\"pulling\\" a shot, originating from lever espresso machines, which require pulling down a handle attached to a spring-loaded piston, forcing hot water through the coffee at high pressure. Today, however, it is more common for the pressure to be generated by an electric pump.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe technical parameters outlined by the Italian Espresso National Institute for making \\r\\na \\"certified Italian espresso\\" are:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nEspresso is both a coffee beverage and a brewing method.  It is not a specific bean, bean blend, or roast level. Any bean or roasting level can be used to produce authentic espresso. For example, in southern Italy, a darker roast is generally preferred.  Farther north, the trend moves toward slightly lighter roasts, while outside Italy a wide range is popular.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAngelo Moriondo, from Turin, patented a steam-driven \\"instantaneous\\" coffee beverage making device in 1884 (No. 33/256). The device is \\"almost certainly the first Italian bar machine that controlled the supply of steam and water separately through the coffee\\" and Moriondo is \\"certainly one of the earliest discoverers of the expresso  [sic] machine, if not the earliest\\".[14] Unlike true espresso machines, it brewed in bulk, not as individual servings. Seventeen years later, in 1901, Luigi Bezzera, from Milan, came up with a number of improvements to the espresso machine. He patented a number of these, the first of which was applied for on 19 December 1901. It was titled \\"Innovations in the machinery to prepare and immediately serve coffee beverage\\" (Patent No. 153/94, 61707, granted on 5 June 1902). In 1905, the patent was bought by Desiderio Pavoni, who founded the La Pavoni company and began to produce the machine industrially (one a day) in a small workshop in Via Parini in Milan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popularity of espresso developed in various ways; a detailed discussion of the spread of espresso is given in (Morris 2007), which is a source of various statements below. In Italy, the rise of espresso consumption was associated with urbanization, espresso bars providing a place for socializing. Further, coffee prices were controlled by local authorities, provided the coffee was consumed standing up, encouraging the \\"stand at a bar\\" culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the English-speaking world, espresso became popular, particularly in the form of cappuccino, owing to the tradition of drinking coffee with milk and the exotic appeal of the foam; in the United States, this was more often in the form of lattes, with or without flavored syrups added. The latte is claimed to have been invented in the 1950s by Italian American Lino Meiorin of Caffe Mediterraneum in Berkeley, California, as a long cappuccino, and was then popularized in Seattle,[15] and then nationally and internationally by Seattle-based Starbucks in the late 1980s and 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, espresso grew in popularity among youth in the 1950s, who felt more welcome in the coffee shops than in public houses (pubs). Espresso was initially popular, particularly within the Italian diaspora, growing in popularity with tourism to Italy exposing others to espresso, as developed by Eiscafs established by Italians in Germany. Initially, expatriate Italian espresso bars were downmarket venues, serving the working-class Italian diaspora and thus providing appeal to the alternative subculture; this can still be seen in the United States in Italian American neighborhoods, such as Boston's North End, New York's Little Italy, and San Francisco's North Beach. As specialty coffee developed in the 1980s (following earlier developments in the 1970s and even 1960s), an indigenous artisanal coffee culture developed, with espresso instead positioned as an upmarket drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2010s, coffee culture commentators distinguish large-chain mid-market coffee as \\"Second Wave Coffee\\", and upmarket artisanal coffee as \\"Third Wave Coffee\\". In the Middle East and Asia, espresso is growing in popularity, with the opening of Western coffee-shop chains.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nHome espresso machines have increased in popularity with the general rise of interest in espresso. Today, a wide range of home espresso equipment can be found in kitchen and appliance stores, online vendors, and department stores. The first espresso machine for home use was the Gaggia Gilda.[17] Soon afterwards, similar machines such as the Faema Faemina, FE-AR La Peppina and VAM Caravel followed suit in similar form factor and operational principles.[18] These machines still have a small but dedicated share of fans. Until the advent of the first small electrical pump-based espresso machines such as the Gaggia Baby and Quickmill 810, home espresso machines were not widely adopted. In recent years, the increased availability of convenient counter-top fully automatic home espresso makers and pod-based espresso serving systems has increased the quantity of espresso consumed at home. The popularity of home espresso making parallels the increase of home coffee roasting. Some amateurs pursue both home roasting coffee and making espresso.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough some Anglo-American dictionaries simply refer to \\"pressed-out\\",[19] \\"espresso\\", much like the English word \\"express\\", conveys the senses of \\"just for you\\" and \\"quickly\\", which can be related to the method of espresso preparation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words express, expres and espresso each have several meanings in English, French and Italian. The first meaning is to do with the idea of \\"expressing\\" or squeezing the flavour from the coffee using the pressure of the steam. The second meaning is to do with speed, as in a train. Finally there is the notion of doing something \\"expressly\\" for a person?... The first Bezzera and Pavoni espresso machines in 1906 took 45 seconds to make a cup of coffee, one at a time, expressly for you.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern espresso, using hot water under pressure, as pioneered by Gaggia in the 1940s, was originally called crema caff, in English \\"cream coffee\\", as can be seen on old Gaggia machines, due to the crema.[21] This term is no longer used, though crema caff and variants (caff crema, caf crema) find occasional use in branding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a debate over whether the spelling expresso is incorrect or whether it is an acceptable variant. It is called a less common variant in some sources.[22] Italy uses the term espresso, substituting s for most x letters in Latin-root words; x is not considered part of the standard Italian alphabet. Italian people commonly refer to it simply as caff (coffee), espresso being the ordinary coffee to order; in Spain, while caf expreso is seen as the more \\"formal\\" denomination, caf solo (alone, without milk) is the usual way to ask for it when at an espresso bar. Some sources state that expresso is an incorrect spelling, including Garner's Modern American Usage.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the 'expresso' spelling is recognized as mainstream usage in some American dictionaries,[24][25] some cooking websites call the 'x' variant illegitimate.[26][27][28][29] Oxford Dictionaries online states \\"The spelling \\"expresso\\" is not used in the original Italian and is strictly incorrect, although it is common.\\"[30] The Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster call it a variant spelling.[23][31] The Online Etymology Dictionary calls \\"expresso\\" a variant of \\"espresso.\\"[32] The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style (2000) describes the spelling expresso as \\"wrong\\", and specifies espresso as the only correct form.[33] The third edition of Fowler's Modern English Usage, published by the Oxford University Press in 1996, noted that the form espresso \\"has entirely driven out the variant expresso (which was presumably invented under the impression that it meant 'fast, express').\\"[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main variables in a shot of espresso are the \\"size\\" and \\"length\\".[35][36] This terminology is standardized, but the precise sizes and proportions vary substantially.\\r\\n\\r\\nCafs may have a standardized shot (size and length), such as \\"triple ristretto\\",[36] only varying the number of shots in espresso-based drinks such as lattes, but not changing the extraction ÿ changing between a double and a triple requires changing the filter basket size, while changing between ristretto, normale, and lungo may require changing the grind, which is less easily accommodated in a busy caf, as fine tweaking of the grind is a central aspect to consistent quality espresso-making.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size can be a single, double, or triple, using a proportional amount of ground coffee, roughly 7, 14, and 21?grams; correspondingly sized filter baskets are used. The Italian multiplier term doppio is often used for a double, with solo and triplo being more rarely used for singles and triples. The single shot is the traditional shot size, being the maximum that could easily be pulled on a lever machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nSingle baskets are sharply tapered or stepped down in diameter to provide comparable depth to the double baskets and, therefore, comparable resistance to water pressure. Most double baskets are gently tapered (the \\"Faema model\\"), while others, such as the La Marzocco, have straight sides. Triple baskets are normally straight-sided.\\r\\n\\r\\nPortafilters will often come with two spouts, usually closely spaced, and a double-size basket ÿ each spout can optionally dispense into a separate cup, yielding two solo-size (but doppio-brewed) shots, or into a single cup (hence the close spacing). True solo shots are rare, with a single shot in a caf generally being half of a doppio shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn espresso-based drinks in America, particularly larger milk-based drinks, a drink with three or four shots of espresso will be called a \\"triple\\" or \\"quad\\", respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe length of the shot can be ristretto (or stretto) (reduced), normale/standard (normal), or lungo (long)[37]:these may correspond to a smaller or larger drink with the same amount of ground coffee and same level of extraction or to different length of extraction. Proportions vary and the volume (and low density) of crema make volume-based comparisons difficult (precise measurement uses the mass of the drink).  Typically ristretto is half the volume of normale, and lungo is double to triple the normale volume.  For a double shot, (14 grams of dry coffee), a normale uses about 60 ml of water.  A double ristretto, a common form associated with espresso, uses half the amount of water, about 30 ml.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nRistretto, normale, and lungo may not simply be the same shot, stopped at different times[citation needed] ÿ which may result in an underextracted shot (if run too short a time) or an overextracted shot (if run too long a time).[citation needed] Rather, the grind is adjusted (finer for ristretto, coarser for lungo) so the target volume is achieved by the time extraction finishes.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nA significantly longer shot is the caff crema, which is longer than a lungo, ranging in size from 120ÿ240 ml (4ÿ8 US fl oz), and brewed in the same way, with a coarser grind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe method of adding hot water produces a milder version of original flavor, while passing more water through the load of ground coffee will add other flavors to the espresso, which might be unpleasant for some people.\\r\\n\\r\\nCold espresso (espresso freddo) is an alternative form of espresso, mostly served in southern Europe. Conceived in Greece, along with cappuccino freddo in the early 1990s, freddo espresso is in higher demand in Greece and its neighbouring countries during summer.[39] After preparing 2 shots of espresso (usually ristretto), the coffee is stirred in a big iron can along with sugar (if necessary) and 2ÿ3 ice cubes until the can is cold. Then the blend is put in a glass full of ice cubes.\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably owing to its higher amount of suspended solids than typical coffee which is absent of essential nutrients, espresso has significant contents of the dietary mineral magnesium, the B vitamins niacin and riboflavin, and 212?mg of caffeine per 100 grams of liquid brewed coffee (table).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to being served alone, espresso is frequently blended, notably with milk ÿ either steamed (without significant foam), wet foamed (\\"microfoam\\"), or dry foamed, and with hot water. Notable milk-based espresso drinks, in order of size, include: macchiato, cappuccino, flat white, and latte; other milk and espresso combinations include latte macchiato, cortado and gal?o, which are made primarily with steamed milk with little or no foam. Espresso and water combinations include Americano and long black.

This \\"pouring into an existing glass\\" is a defining characteristic of the latte macchiato and classic renditions of the red eye.

Many beds include a box spring inner-sprung base, which is a large mattress-sized box containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress. Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs, to small beds for a single child or adult, to large queen and king-size beds designed for two adults. While most beds are single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as the murphy bed, which folds into a wall, the sofa bed, which folds out of a sofa, and the bunk bed, which provides two mattresses on two tiers. Temporary beds include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot. Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as the hammock, which is considered one of the most comfortable places to rest while swaying side to side. Some beds are made especially for animals.\\r\\nBeds may have a headboard for resting against, and may have side rails and footboards (or \\"footers\\"). \\"Headboard only\\" beds may incorporate a \\"dust ruffle\\", \\"bed skirt\\", or \\"valance sheet\\" to hide the bed frame. To support the head, a pillow made of a soft, padded material is usually placed on the top of the mattress. Some form of covering blanket is often used to insulate the sleeper, often bed sheets, a quilt, or a duvet, collectively referred to as bedding. Bedding is the removable non-furniture portion of a bed, which enables these components to be washed or aired out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly beds were little more than piles of straw or some other natural material (e.g. a heap of palm leaves, animal skins, or dried bracken). An important change was raising them off the ground, to avoid drafts, dirt, and pests. Bedding dated around to 3600 BC was discovered in Sibudu Cave, South Africa.[3] The bedding consists of sedge and other monocotyledons topped with the leaves of Cryptocarya woodii Engl.[3] Beds found in a preserved northern Scottish village, which were raised boxes made of stone and likely topped with comfortable fillers, were dated to between 3200 BC and 2200 BC.[4] The Egyptians had high bedsteads which were ascended by steps, with bolsters or pillows, and curtains to hang around. The elite of Egyptian society such as its pharaohs and queens even had beds made of wood, sometimes gilded. Often there was a head-rest as well, semi-cylindrical and made of stone, wood, or metal. Ancient Assyrians, Medes, and Persians had beds of a similar kind, and frequently decorated their furniture with inlays or appliques of metal, mother-of-pearl, and ivory.\\r\\nThe image to the right showcases a headrest. Headrests like this were used in life to support the head while sleeping. They are also found supporting a mummys head in the coffin. This headrest perhaps was made specifically for the tomb, since the offering prayer has been inscribed on the supporting column, although the prayer may have been added after the death of the owner.[5]\\r\\nThe oldest account of a bed is probably that of Odysseus: a charpoy[6] woven of rope plays a role in the Odyssey. A similar bed can be seen at the St Fagans National History Museum in Wales. Odysseus also gives an account of how he crafted the nuptial bed for himself and Penelope, out of an ancient, huge olive tree trunk that used to grow on the spot before the bridal chamber was built. His detailed description finally persuades the doubting Penelope that the shipwrecked, aged man is indeed her long-lost husband. Homer also mentions the inlaying of the woodwork of beds with gold, silver, and ivory. The Greek bed had a wooden frame, with a board at the head and bands of hide laced across, upon which skins were placed. At a later period the bedstead was often veneered with expensive woods; sometimes it was of solid ivory veneered with tortoise-shell and with silver feet; often it was of bronze. The pillows and coverings also became more costly and beautiful; the most celebrated places for their manufacture were Miletus, Corinth and Carthage. Folding beds, too, appear in the famous Ancient Greek vase paintings.\\r\\nRoman mattresses were stuffed with reeds, hay, or wool. Feathers were used towards the end of the Republic, when custom demanded luxury. Small cushions were placed at the head and sometimes at the back. The bedsteads were high and could only be ascended by the help of steps. They were often arranged for two people, and had a board or railing at the back, as well as the raised portion at the head. The counterpanes were sometimes very costly, generally purple embroidered with figures in gold; and rich hangings fell to the ground masking the front. The bedsteads themselves were often of bronze inlaid with silver, and Elagabalus had one of solid silver. In the walls of some houses at Pompeii bed niches are found which were probably closed by curtains or sliding partitions. Ancient Romans had various kinds of beds for repose. These included:\\r\\nThe ancient Germans lay on the floor on beds of leaves covered with skins, or in a kind of shallow chest filled with leaves and moss. In the early Middle Ages they laid carpets on the floor or on a bench against the wall, placed upon them mattresses stuffed with feathers, wool, or hair, and used skins as a covering. Curtains were hung from the ceiling or from an iron arm projecting from the wall.[8] They appear to have generally lain naked in bed, wrapping themselves in large linen sheets which were stretched over the cushions.\\r\\nIn the 12th century, luxury increased and bedsteads were made of wood much decorated with inlaid, carved, and painted ornamentation. They also used folding beds, which served as couches by day and had cushions covered with silk laid upon leather. At night a linen sheet was spread and pillows placed, while silk-covered skins served as coverlets. The Carolingian manuscripts show metal bedsteads much higher at the head than at the feet, and this shape continued in use until the 13th century in France, many cushions being added to raise the body to a sloping position. In 12th-century manuscripts, the bedsteads appear much richer, with inlays, carving, and painting, and with embroidered coverlets and mattresses in harmony. Curtains were hung above the bed and a small hanging lamp is often shown.\\r\\nIn the 14th century the woodwork became of less importance, generally being entirely covered by hangings of rich materials. Silk, velvet, and even cloth of gold were frequently used. Inventories from the beginning of the 14th century give details of these hangings lined with fur and richly embroidered. It was then that the Four poster bed (also known as a tester bed) made its first appearance, the bed being slung from the ceiling or fastened to the walls, a form which developed later into a room within a room, shut in by double curtains, sometimes even to exclude all drafts. The space between bed and wall was called the ruelle, and very intimate friends were received there. The 14th century is also the time when feather beds became highly prized possessions.[8]\\r\\nIn the 15th century beds became very large, reaching 7 to 8 feet (2.1 to 2.4?m) by 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1?m). The mattresses were often filled with pea-shucks, straw, or feathers. At this time great personages were in the habit of carrying most of their property about with them, including beds and bed-hangings, and for this reason the bedsteads were for the most part mere frameworks to be covered up; but about the beginning of the 16th century bedsteads were made lighter and more decorative, since the lords remained in the same place for longer periods.\\r\\nIn the 17th century, which has been called \\"the century of magnificent beds\\", the style a la duchesse, with tester and curtains only at the head, replaced the more enclosed beds in France, though they lasted much longer in England. Louis XIV had an enormous number of sumptuous beds, as many as 413 being described in the inventories of his palaces. Some of them had embroideries enriched with pearls, and figures on a silver or golden ground. The great bed at Versailles had crimson velvet curtains on which \\"The Triumph of Venus\\" was embroidered. So much gold was used that the velvet scarcely showed.\\r\\nIn the 18th century feather pillows were first used as coverings in Germany, which in the fashions of the bed and the curious etiquette connected with the bedchamber followed France for the most part. The beds were a la duchesse, but in France itself there was great variety both of name and shape. The custom of the \\"bed of justice\\" upon which the king of France reclined when he was present in parliament, the princes being seated, the great officials standing, and the lesser officials kneeling, was held to denote the royal power even more than the throne.\\r\\nLouis XI is credited with its first use and the custom lasted till the end of the monarchy. In the chambre de parade, where the ceremonial bed was placed, certain persons, such as ambassadors or great lords, whom it was desired to honour, were received in a more intimate fashion than the crowd of courtiers. At Versailles women received their friends in their beds, both before and after childbirth, during periods of mourning, and even directly after marriagein fact in any circumstances which were thought deserving of congratulation or condolence. During the 17th century this curious custom became general, perhaps to avoid the tiresome details of etiquette. Portable beds were used in high society in France till the end of the Ancien Rgime. The earliest of which mention has been found belonged to Charles the Bold. They had curtains over a light framework, and were in their way as fine as the stationary beds.\\r\\nIron beds appear in the 18th century; the advertisements declare them as free from the insects which sometimes infested wooden bedsteads. Elsewhere, there was also the closed bed with sliding or folding shutters, and in Englandwhere beds were commonly quite simple in formthe four poster was the usual citizen's bed until the middle of the 19th century.\\r\\nBed sizes vary considerably around the world, with most countries having their own standards and terminology. While the \\"double\\" size appears to be standard among English speaking countries, based on the imperial measurement of 4?ft 6?in by 6?ft 3?in (137?cm x 190?cm), the sizes for other bed types tend to vary. The mainland European sizes differ, not merely because of the use of the metric system.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the mid-1950s, the United States bedding industry introduced a new size: the king size.[9] A king-sized bed differs from the other sizes in implementation, as it is not common to have a king-sized box spring; rather, two smaller box-springs are used under a king-sized mattress. It is a common misconception that in a US \\"standard\\" or \\"Eastern king\\", the box springs are identical in size to a \\"twin extra-long\\"; however, \\"twin extra-long\\" mattresses next to each other add up to 78 inches (200?cm) wide instead of the 76 inches (190?cm) width that is standard for an \\"eastern king\\". Another size variant in the United States is the \\"California king\\", which measures 72 by 84 inches (180?cm G?210?cm) long (narrower but longer than the standard king).\\r\\nWhat is referred to as a \\"single bed\\" in many parts of the world may also be known in US terminology as a \\"twin bed.\\" In some countries, a \\"twin bed\\" may also be used to describe one of two single beds in the same room. As another example, in some cultures, the \\"full mattress\\" is referred to as a \\"master size bed.\\"\\r\\nWhen a mattress is available in fixed size (for example, twin or queen), and the description does not specify the exact size, this table may be used.\\r\\nAll mattresses are made according to certain standards, but different brands sometimes have exceptions. Most often, the difference is 2-5 inches. When calling a business to check, specify the exact size of the mattress.\\r\\nOne of the largest beds in the world is the Great Bed of Ware, made in about 1580. It is 3.26 metres (10.7?ft) wide, 3.38 metres (11.1?ft) long. The bed is mentioned by Shakespeare in Twelfth Night. It is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) in London. Another bed in the V&A is the Golden Bed created by William Burges in 1879.[10]\\r\\nIn 1882, an Indian Maharajah had a bed made of solid silver. At each corner of the bed there was a life-sized statue of a naked woman holding a fan. When the Maharajah lay on the bed, his weight started a mechanism that made the women wave their fans.[11]\\r\\nIn 1865, a convertible bed in the form of an upright piano was available, which could provide home entertainment while saving space.[12]\\r\\n[original research?]\\r\\nThere are many varieties of beds:\\r\\nBed frames, also called bed steads, are made of wood or metal. The frame is made up of head, foot, and side rails. For heavy duty or larger frames (such as for queen- and king-sized beds), the bed frame also includes a center support rail. These rails are assembled to create a box for the mattress or mattress/box spring to sit on.\\r\\nTypes include:\\r\\nThough not truly parts of a bed frame, headboards, footboards, and bed rails can be included in the definition. Headboards and footboards can be wood or metal. They can be stained, painted, or covered in fabric or leather.\\r\\nBed rails are made of wood or metal and are attached to a headboard and footboard. Wooden slats are placed perpendicular to the bed rails to support the mattress/mattress box spring. Bed rails and frames are often attached to the bed post using knock-down fittings.[15][16] A knock-down fitting enables the bed to be easily dismantled for removal. Primary knock-down fittings for bed rails are as follows:\\r\\nSafety rails,[17] or cot sides, can be added to the sides of a bed (normally a child or elderly person's bed) to stop anyone falling out of the sides of the bed. A safety rail is normally a piece of wood that attaches to the side rails on one or both sides of the bed. They are made so that they can be easily removed when no longer required.","input":"When was the first king size bed made?"},{"output":"15,995","context":"Great Bend is a city in and the county seat of Barton County, Kansas, United States.[6] It is named for its location at the point where the course of the Arkansas River bends east then southeast.[7] As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 15,995.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to American settlement of the area, the site of Great Bend was located in the northern reaches of Kiowa territory.[9] Claimed first by France as part of Louisiana and later acquired by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, it lay within the area organized by the U.S. as Kansas Territory in 1854.[10][11] Kansas became a state in 1861, and the state government delineated the surrounding area as Barton County in 1867.[11][12]\\r\\nThe first settlers of the area arrived in 1870. Living in sod houses and dugouts, they worked as buffalo hunters since trampling by bison herds precluded crop farming.[13] In 1871, the Great Bend Town Company, anticipating the westward construction of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, founded Great Bend at a site roughly three miles west of Fort Zarah on the Santa Fe Trail.[13][14] They named the settlement after its location at the \\"great bend\\" in the Arkansas River where the rivers course turns eastward.[7] The town began to grow as more settlers arrived over the following year and opened several businesses.\\r\\nThe railroad reached Great Bend in July 1872, and an election at about the same time declared the town the permanent county seat.[12] Great Bend was incorporated as a city soon thereafter. The county courthouse and the citys first public school were built the following year.[14]\\r\\nIn 1873, following the arrival of the railroad, Great Bend became a shipping point for cattle.[14] This stimulated local business but also transformed the city into a rowdy, violent cowtown.[13] In 1876, the Kansas Legislature extended the legal \\"dead line\\" restricting the presence of Texas cattle 30 miles west of Barton County. The cattle trade moved westward accordingly, and the city became more peaceful.[14]\\r\\nOver the following decades, Great Bend continued to grow and modernize, becoming a center of area commerce. This was despite two disasters which struck the city: a downtown fire in 1878 and a smallpox outbreak in 1882 which resulted in a brief quarantine.[14] In 1886, local speculators began to fund exploration for petroleum in the area. By 1930, the oil and gas industry brought more than $20 million annually to the county.[15] More than 3,000 wells produced during the 1930s, and the influx of workers dramatically increased the citys population.[13]\\r\\nThe U.S. Army Air Forces opened Great Bend Army Airfield west of the city in 1943. The base served as training facility for B-29 bomber aircraft personnel during World War II.[16] After the war, the City of Great Bend acquired the base and repurposed it for civilian use as Great Bend Municipal Airport.[17]\\r\\nThe city continued to grow through the 1950s, its population peaking at almost 17,000 in 1960. In 1973, the Fuller Brush Company relocated its production facilities to Great Bend, becoming one of the citys major employers. Despite a modest decline in population in recent decades, Great Bend continues to serve as a commercial center for central Kansas.[13]\\r\\nGreat Bend is located at 382152N 984553W? / ?38.36444N 98.76472W? / 38.36444; -98.76472 (38.3644567, -98.7648073) at an elevation of 1,850 feet (564 m).[5] Located in central Kansas at the intersection of U.S. Route 281 and U.S. Route 56, Great Bend is 95 miles (153?km) northwest of Wichita, 235 miles (378?km) west-southwest of Kansas City, and 345 miles (555?km) east-southeast of Denver.[18][19]\\r\\nLying in the Great Bend Sand Prairie region of the Great Plains, the city is situated on the north side of the Arkansas River where the river's course shifts from northeast to southeast.[20][21] Dry Walnut Creek, a tributary of nearby Walnut Creek, flows east along the northern edge of the city.[22] Cheyenne Bottoms, a large inland wetland, is located approximately 6 miles (9.7?km) to the northeast.[23]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.71 square miles (27.74?km2), of which 10.60 square miles (27.45?km2) is land and 0.11 square miles (0.28?km2) is water.[1]\\r\\nLocated near the convergence of North America's humid continental (K?ppen Dfa), humid subtropical (K?ppen Cfa), and semi-arid (K?ppen BSk) climate zones, Great Bend experiences hot summers and cold, dry winters.[24] On average, January is the coldest month, July the hottest and May is the wettest. The hottest temperature recorded in Great Bend was 111?F (44?C) in 1980; the coldest temperature recorded was -21?F (-29?C) in 1989.[25]\\r\\nThe average temperature is 57?F (14?C).[26] Over the course of a year, temperatures range from an average low of 21?F (?6?C) in January to an average high of 94?F (34?C) in July.[25] The high temperature reaches or exceeds 90?F (32?C) an average of 70 days a year and reaches or exceeds 100?F (38?C) an average of 13 days a year.

Males had a median income of $33,623 versus $25,038 for females. The per capita income for the city was $24,529. About 10.2% of families and 13.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.7% of those under age 18 and 7.7% of those age 65 or over.[8]\\r\\nAgriculture is the predominant industry in Great Bend, and its grain elevators are visible from miles away. The oil industry flourished from about 1930-1960. There was even an oil well in the city park. But this industry has been on the decline for years. Cattle raising is also an important source of income for many people.\\r\\nAs of 2012, 66.5% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force. 0.0% was in the armed forces, and 66.5% was in the civilian labor force with 61.0% employed and 5.5% unemployed.

The four industries employing the largest percentages of the working civilian labor force were: educational services, health care, and social assistance (27.3%); retail trade (11.9%); manufacturing (9.8%); and arts, entertainment, recreation, and accommodation and food services (9.8%).[8] Great Bend Public Schools, Barton Community College, and CUNA Mutual Retirement Solutions are the city's three largest employers. Other major employers include local government, local hospitals, Wal-Mart, Superior Essex, and Fuller Brush Company.[28]\\r\\nThe cost of living in Great Bend is relatively low; compared to a U.S. average of 100, the cost of living index for the city is 79.4.[29] As of 2012, the median home value in the city was $78,300, the median selected monthly owner cost was $979 for housing units with a mortgage and $400 for those without, and the median gross rent was $539.[8]\\r\\nGreat Bend is a city of the second class with a mayor-council form of government.[30] The city council consists of eight members, two elected from each city ward for two-year terms. The mayor is elected at-large, also for a two-year term. The mayor and city council together constitute the city's Governing Body which sets goals, establishes policies, and approves all ordinances and resolutions.[31] The council meets on the first and third Monday of each month.[30]\\r\\nAs the county seat, Great Bend is the administrative center of Barton County. The county courthouse is located downtown, and most departments of the county government base their operations in the city.[32]\\r\\nGreat Bend lies within Kansas's 1st U.S. Congressional District. For the purposes of representation in the Kansas Legislature, the city is located in the 33rd district of the Kansas Senate and the 112th district of the Kansas House of Representatives.[30]\\r\\nGreat Bend Public Schools (USD 428) serves approximately 3,000 students and operates eight schools in the city:[33]\\r\\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Dodge City oversees one school in Great Bend, Holy Family School (Pre-Kÿ6).[34] There is also one non-denominational Christian school in the city, Central Kansas Christian Academy (K-8).[35]\\r\\nBarton Community College, a two-year public college, is located approximately three miles northeast of Great Bend.[36][37]\\r\\nGreat Bend was located on the National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, that was established in 1912.[citation needed] Currently, two U.S. Highways and two Kansas state highways pass through the city. U.S. Route 281 runs northÿsouth through Great Bend, intersecting U.S. Route 56, K-96, and K-156 which run concurrently eastÿwest through the city. K-96 splits from U.S. 56 and K-156 in western Great Bend, exiting the city to the northwest. U.S. 56 and K-156 continue concurrently west, then turn south and ultimately southwest.[38]\\r\\nGreat Bend Municipal Airport is located approximately 2 miles (3.2?km) west of the city.[38] Used primarily for general aviation, it hosts one commercial airline with daily flights to Denver.[39][40]\\r\\nA Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad line runs eastÿwest through the city with a second line branching off to the northwest, paralleling K-96.[22]\\r\\nThe city government's Public Works Department is responsible for water distribution, waste water treatment, and sewer maintenance. One of the few cities in the area not to have a water treatment plant or water tower, Great Bend obtains its water supply directly from ten wells located throughout the city.[41] Waste water is treated and recycled at the city's Wastewater Treatment Facility and then emptied into the Arkansas River.[42] Two regional energy cooperatives, Midwest Energy, Inc. and Wheatland Electric, provide electric power.[43] Local residents primarily use natural gas for heating fuel; Midwest Energy and Kansas Gas Service both provide natural gas service.[29][43]\\r\\nThere is one primary medical facility in the city. Great Bend Regional Hospital, a 33-bed general medical and surgical facility, is the city's sole hospital.[44] St. Rose Ambulatory & Surgery Center, formerly Central Kansas Medical Center, was an outpatient care facility affiliated with Catholic Health Initiatives.[45] St. Rose Ambulatory & Surgery Center was closed and demolished in 2015.\\r\\nThe Great Bend Tribune is the city's daily newspaper with a circulation of over 6,200 copies.[46]\\r\\nThe Interrobang is the student newspaper at the Great Bend-based Barton Community College.\\r\\nGreat Bend is a center of broadcast media for central Kansas.[47][48] Two AM and ten FM radio stations are licensed to and/or broadcast from the city.[47] Two television stations, one NBC affiliate and one ABC affiliate, also broadcast from the city.[48] Both are satellite stations of their respective affiliates in Wichita as Great Bend is part of the Wichita-Hutchinson, Kansas television market.[48][49]\\r\\nThe city government's Park Department maintains 10 parks in the city.[50] The two largest are Brit Spaugh Park and Veteran's Memorial Park. Located in the north-central part of the city, Brit Spaugh Park includes the Great Bend Zoo, the Wetlands Aquatic Center, two softball fields, horseshoe courts, picnic areas, playgrounds, a skateboarding area, and a BMX track. Veteran's Park is located in the northwestern part of the city and includes an 18-hole disc golf course, a fishing lake with limited boating, sand volleyball, ballfields, a playground, and walking trails.

It is set in the surgical wing of the fictional Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, located in Seattle, Washington.\\r\\nAfter the explosion at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, Chief Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) finds it the perfect time to give the place a much needed upgrade in look and functionality. During the construction, Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) struggles with the shocking reunion with his sister, Megan (Abigail Spencer), who was recently found in a hostage camp overseas. The discovery also welcomes back Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), the former chief cardiothoracic surgery and Owens best friend, which leads to awkward moments with Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone). Of course, Nathan Riggs (Martin Henderson), who was once in love with Megan, is torn between his love for her and his most recent interest in Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) learns what ghosting is after Eliza Minnick (Marika Dominczyk) vanishes without a trace, but she quickly finds company in an Italian girl she met at the bar, Carina DeLuca (Stefania Spampinato), sister to Andrew DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti). Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington) struggles to patch her relationship with Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), but when her attempts fail, she finds herself sleeping with one of the new interns.\\r\\nWhen Carina finds that Amelia has a brain tumor, she brings her former mentor/professor Dr Tom Koracek (Greg Germann) to create a treatment plan. But when he points out how the tumor has affected her judgment, she fears that it might have ruined her patients lives or put them in more dangerspecifically Dr Nicole Herman (Geena Davis), who despite saving her life, left her blind. After the tumor is removed, Amelia and Owen reflect on their marriage and decide that everything up to that point has been misguided; the tumor made Amelia someone she was not, and they ultimately decide to get a divorce. With all the changes happening at Grey Sloan, Harper Avery (Chelcie Ross) shows up to discuss everything with Bailey and then ends up firing her. Shortly after, he immediately dies from cardiac arrest. Before they have to find another chief, Catherine (Debbie Allen) and Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) reinstate Bailey to her position. At a family dinner hosted by Catherine and Richard Weber (James Pickens Jr.), Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) and Jackson learn that hell be receiving his grandfathers inheritance, a quarter billion dollars, which hell eventually use to fund a medical research contest.\\r\\nNow that Megan is healthy again, Meredith and Nathan work together to bring her son over to the United States. Upon arrival, Nathan, Megan, and Farouk all move to California to start a life together, which officially ends Nathans relationship with Meredith. Despite the breakup, Meredith has more exciting news on the horizon when she learns at the intern mixer that a ground breaking surgery has earned her a nomination for the highly-esteemed Harper Avery Foundation Award, which she goes on to win. While the joyous news spreads around the hospital, Bailey learns that Ben Warren (Jason George) wants to leave surgery to join the Seattle Fire Department. With Jo and Alex now living together again, she realizes how much control her estranged husband, Dr Paul Stadler (Matthew Morrison), has over her. Now in the running for chief resident, Jo decides to file for divorce. With her mind on her secret relationship with Paul, shes surprised to find him in the hospital. Jo attempts to steer clear of him, but at the same time also believes she has a duty to inform Pauls fianc of what type of man he really is. As Paul keeps trying to find Jo, Meredith pretends to call security to have him removed, but he leaves before they can get there. However, he winds up back in the ER as a victim of a hit and run accident. With everyone running around the ER, April Kepner (Sarah Drew) sees a familiar face in Matthew (Justin Bruening), the paramedic she left at the altar for Jackson. Hes there with his wife who is now pregnant. After Jo talks to Jenny (Bethany Joy Lenz), Pauls fianc, they venture to Pauls room to tell him theyre taking him to court. Upon receiving the news, he tries to attack them in a bout of rage; however, he falls out of bed and hits his head knocking him unconscious, rendering him brain dead. Still legally his wife, Jo decides to have them remove all life-sustaining support. April struggles with the idea that the man she left to pursue her own happiness is now married and expecting a child, while shes alone and a single mother. As she begins to question her faith, she acts out and sleeps with an intern.\\r\\nWith all the stress and work that comes with being Chief of Surgery, Bailey begins to show signs of a heart attack. She winds up at Seattle Presbyterian Hospital, where the doctors take her concerns less than seriously. They see in her chart a history of OCD and believe that is the underlying issue, since the tests they are running are coming back negative. Bailey calls on Maggie to save her, and after she does, Bailey decides to support Bens decision to become a firefighter, as she realizes life is too short to do anything than what makes you happy.\\r\\nWith the medical research contest, funded by Jacksons money, getting underway, the doctors begin to team up and brainstorm ideas that will help them win the top prize of a grant that will fund their research even further. Meredith learns that for her project, shell need to acquire a patent that is owned by Marie Ceronea former friend of her mothers. When Marie denies access to the patent, Meredith is forced to investigate further into the reason why. According to Richard, there was a falling out of some sort, but he never knew what happened between the two women. At a dinner party hosted by Amelia, Maggie brings her new boyfriend around to meet her friends. However, its soon revealed that her boyfriend is a married man. Quick to call it off, Jackson sees his opportunity to invest in his love interest with Maggie. In Merediths search for answers, she learns that Ellis Grey left Maries name off the surgical method they created together. If she is to acquire the patent, she must publicly announce a change the methods name to the Grey-Cerone Method. Meredith denies the ultimatum. While Maggie and Jackson try to get past the quirks of their relationship and the fact that their step-siblings, Jo shockingly asks Alex to marry him. He quickly accepts.\\r\\nWith the research projects humming along, Owen and Amelia continue to take advantage of their friends with benefits relationship, that is until Amelia learns how close Owen is with Teddy. She advises him to go after her if shes the love of his life. The advice sends him to Germany where he surprises Teddy. The two talk all night and make plans to stay together, but when she learns that Amelia had just told him the night before to pursue her, she refuses to be his backup plan and kicks him out.\\r\\nBailey is surprised to learn that one of her interns, Sam Bello (Jeanine Mason), is a Dreamer protected by (DACA). Meredith designs a plan to keep from being deported. Despite pleas from Andrew (Sams boyfriend), Meredith sends to work under Dr Cristina Yang in Switzerland. While the research contest reaches the next milestone, presentation day, Catherine confronts Jackson about a major secret concerning his grandfather. The man had 13 cases of sexual harassment filed against him, and she herself paid the women major settlements to keep it all covered up. Meredith learns of this truth and also that Marie Cerone was one of the 13. Disgusted with the whole situation, Meredith decides to return her and her mothers Harper Avery awards and Bailey shuts down the research contest. In the meantime, Catherine tries with all her might to save the face of the foundation since the news has spread. While in surgery, Jackson and Meredith come up with their own plan, which is to rename the foundation in honor of Catherine (ne Fox) to the Catherine Fox Foundation.\\r\\nWhen Alex learns that his mom hasnt been cashing the checks hes been sending, he and Jo take off to Iowa to check on her. He surprisingly finds that she is doing well and even works her old job at the library. The two extend an invitation to the wedding, but she declines stating it would be too much for her. While Owen and Amelia struggle with adjusting to being foster parentsOwen to a baby and Amelia to the babys teenaged mother on drugs, Arizona continues to battle with Sofia who wants to move back to New York to be with her other mom, Callie. After calling Callie to tell her theyre moving to the east coast to be closer to her, Arizona announced her impeding departure to Bailey. However, an unexpected visit from Nicole Herman changes those plans just slightly. Nicole has been following Arizonas work and she would like to partner with her in creating the Robbins-Herman Center for Womens Health. Knowing that shes headed to New York, Arizona asks that it be there, and Nicole obliges.\\r\\nMatthew winds up in the ER again, but this time for himself, after he rolled his car. Trying to get information from him about what happened, he mentions Aprils name, which sends the doctors into a frenzy trying to make sure shes safe. Owen finds her unconscious at the site of the accident, down in a ravine nearby. After he rushes her back to the hospital, the team rallies to save her, and after extreme measures have been taken to bring her back to life, she wakes up, fully functional. Alex and Jos wedding day has arrived, and though most details have come together, April (who has been planning the wedding) panics when multiple guests go to the wrong ceremony. While trying to escape, the mother of the bride faints, keeping Ben and Bailey behind. Once at the hospital, Bailey struggles to find an available cardio surgeon until Teddy unexpectedly arrives looking for a job. Jo learns shes been accepted into Mass Gens fellowship program, but fearful of losing Alex, Meredith offers Jo the general surgery attending position. The wedding is delayed when the wedding planner goes into anaphylactic shock and an emergency tracheotomy is performed to save her. After the guests leave thinking therell be no wedding, the pastor finally arrives in time to marry April and Matthew after a surprise re-engagement. On a ferry back to the main land, Maggie has the idea to have Meredith ordained online to officiate the wedding right there on the ferry. Bailey, wanting to take a break from being chief to focus on her passions, offers Teddy the chance to be interim chief. Watching the wedding happening at the hospital on a tablet, in the ICU with the brides mother, Teddy reveals shes pregnant. Arizona says her sad goodbyes before heading to New York, but is giddy to be closer to Callie who is recently single.\\r\\nSeries regular Jerrika Hinton does not appear for the first time since her introduction at the start of the 9th season, after it was announced she landed a starring role in Alan Ball's new HBO drama series Here and Now.[19][4] Hinton had previously been in talks of leaving the show at the end of the 12th season when she was cast in the Shondaland comedy pilot Toast, but ABC passed on the project.[20] Renewing her contract for another three seasons as Dr. Arizona Robbins after the eleventh season, Jessica Capshaw returned for the 14th season.[21] On June 20, 2017, it was announced that Kim Raver would reprise her role as Dr. Teddy Altman for a guest arc.[8] In August 2017, it was announced that Abigail Spencer would replace Bridget Regan as Megan Hunt for a multi-episode arc this season.[9] After recurring in the previous season as the controversial character, Eliza Minnick, it was announced in August 2017 that Marika Dominczyk would not return to the show.[22] On September 13, 2017, another guest star was announced in Greg Germann (Ally McBeal), and later it was revealed that his character would be Tom Koracick, Amelia's neurosurgery mentor.[10]\\r\\nOn October 9, 2017, the new group of interns to join the cast in the fourth episode \\"Ain't That a Kick in the Head\\" was announced to include Jeanine Mason (So You Think You Can Dance) as Sam, Alex Blue Davis as Casey, Rushi Kota as Vik, Jaicy Elliot as Taryn, Sophia Ali as Dahlia, and Jake Borelli as Levi.[13] On October 26, 2017, it was announced that Martin Henderson's appearance in the fifth episode titled \\"Danger Zone\\" would be his last.[23]\\r\\nOn January 31, 2018, it was announced that Candis Cayne would be joining the show as Dr. Michelle Velez for a multi-episode arc revolving around a transgender character receiving a ground breaking surgery.[24] On March 8, 2018, it was announced that both Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew would leave the series following the conclusion of the season.[6]\\r\\nIt was released on April 4, 2018 that a familiar character would be returning to the set later on in the season as Sarah Utterback's Nurse Olivia Harper would be revisiting Grey Sloan, not as a nurse but as mom of a patient.

The two species of Salmonella are Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori. Salmonella enterica is the type species and is further divided into six subspecies[1] that include over 2,500 serotypes.\\r\\nSalmonella species are non-spore-forming, predominantly motile enterobacteria with cell diameters between about 0.7 and 1.5 m, lengths from 2 to 5?m, and peritrichous flagella (all around the cell body).[2] They are chemotrophs, obtaining their energy from oxidation and reduction reactions using organic sources. They are also facultative anaerobes, capable of generating ATP with oxygen (\\"aerobically\\") when it is available; or when oxygen is not available, using other electron acceptors or fermentation (\\"anaerobically\\").[2] S. enterica subspecies are found worldwide in all warm-blooded animals and in the environment. S. bongori is restricted to cold-blooded animals, particularly reptiles.[3]\\r\\nSalmonella species are intracellular pathogens:[4] certain serotypes cause illness. Nontyphoidal serotypes can be transferred from animal-to-human and from human-to-human. They usually invade only the gastrointestinal tract and cause Salmonella food poisoning; symptoms resolve without antibiotics. However, in sub-Saharan Africa they can be invasive and cause paratyphoid fever, which requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. Typhoidal serotypes can only be transferred from human-to-human, and can cause Salmonella food poisoning, typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.[5] Typhoid fever occurs when Salmonella invades the bloodstreamthe typhoidal form; or in addition spreads throughout the body, invades organs, and secretes endotoxinsthe septic form. This can lead to life-threatening hypovolemic shock and septic shock and requires intensive care including antibiotics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genus Salmonella is part of the family of Enterobacteriaceae. Its taxonomy has been revised and has the potential to confuse. The genus comprises two species, Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica, the latter of which is divided into six subspecies: S. e. enterica, S. e. salamae, S. e. arizonae, S. e. diarizonae, S. e. houtenae, and S. e. indica.[6][7] The taxonomic group contains more than 2500 serotypes (also serovars) defined on the basis of the somatic O (lipopolysaccharide) and flagellar H antigens (the KauffmanÿWhite classification). The full name of a serotype is given as, for example, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhimurium, but can be abbreviated to Salmonella Typhimurium. Further differentiation of strains to assist clinical and epidemiological investigation may be achieved by antibiotic sensitivity testing and by other molecular biology techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and, increasingly, whole genome sequencing. Historically, salmonellae have been clinically categorized as invasive (typhoidal) or noninvasive (nontyphoidal salmonellae) based on host preference and disease manifestations in humans.[8]\\r\\nSalmonella was first visualized in 1880 by Karl Eberth in the Peyer's patches and spleens of typhoid patients.[9] Four years later in 1884 Georg Theodor Gaffky was able to successfully grow the pathogen in pure culture.[10] A year after that, medical research scientist Theobald Smith discovered what would be later known as Salmonella enterica (var. Choleraesuis). At the time, Smith was working as a research laboratory assistant in the Veterinary Division of the United States Department of Agriculture. The department was under the administration of Daniel Elmer Salmon, a veterinary pathologist.[11] Initially, Salmonella Choleraesuis was thought to be the causative agent of hog cholera, so Salmon and Smith named it \\"Hog-cholerabacillus\\". The name Salmonella was not used until 1900, when Joseph Leon Lignires proposed that the pathogen discovered by Salmon's group be called Salmonella in his honor.[12]:16\\r\\nMost subspecies of Salmonella produce hydrogen sulfide,[13] which can readily be detected by growing them on media containing ferrous sulfate, such as is used in the triple sugar iron test. Most isolates exist in two phases: a motile phase I and a nonmotile phase II. Cultures that are nonmotile upon primary culture may be switched to the motile phase using a Craigie tube or ditch plate.[14] RVS broth can be used to enrich for Salmonella species for detection in a clinical sample.[15]\\r\\nSalmonella can also be detected and subtyped using multiplex[16] or real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCR)[17] from extracted Salmonella DNA.\\r\\nMathematical models of Salmonella growth kinetics have been developed for chicken, pork, tomatoes, and melons.[18][19][20][21][22] Salmonella reproduce asexually with a cell division interval of 40 minutes.[12]:16\\r\\nSalmonella species lead predominantly host-associated lifestyles, but the bacteria were found to be able to persist in a bathroom setting for weeks following contamination, and are frequently isolated from water sources, which act as bacterial reservoirs and may help to facilitate transmission between hosts.[23] Salmonella is notorious for its ability to survive desiccation and can persist for years in dry environments and foods.[24]\\r\\nThe bacteria are not destroyed by freezing,[25][26] but UV light and heat accelerate their destruction. They perish after being heated to 55?C (131?F) for 90 min, or to 60?C (140?F) for 12 min.[27] To protect against Salmonella infection, heating food for at least 10 minutes to an internal temperature of 75?C (167?F) is recommended.[28][29]\\r\\nSalmonella species can be found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, especially reptiles. Salmonella on the skin of reptiles or amphibians can be passed to people who handle the animals.[30] Food and water can also be contaminated with the bacteria if they come in contact with the feces of infected people or animals.[31]\\r\\nInitially, each Salmonella \\"species\\" was named according to clinical considerations,[32] for example Salmonella typhi-murium (mouse typhoid fever), S. cholerae-suis. After it was recognized that host specificity did not exist for many species, new strains received species names according to the location at which the new strain was isolated. Later, molecular findings led to the hypothesis that Salmonella consisted of only one species,[33] S. enterica, and the serotypes were classified into six groups,[34] two of which are medically relevant. As this now-formalized nomenclature[35][36] is not in harmony with the traditional usage familiar to specialists in microbiology and infectologists, the traditional nomenclature is still common. Currently, the two recognized species are S. enterica, and S. bongori. In 2005, a third species, Salmonella subterranean, was proposed, but according to the World Health Organization, the bacterium reported does not belong in the genus Salmonella.[37] The six main recognised subspecies are: enterica (serotype I), salamae (serotype II), arizonae (IIIa), diarizonae (IIIb), houtenae (IV), and indica (VI).[38] The former serotype (V) was bongori, which is now considered its own species.\\r\\nThe serotype or serovar, is a classification of Salmonella into subspecies based on antigens that the organism presents. It is based on the Kauffman-White classification scheme that differentiates serological varieties from each other. Serotypes are usually put into subspecies groups after the genus and species, with the serotypes/serovars capitalized, but not italicized: An example is Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. More modern approaches for typing and subtyping Salmonella include DNA-based methods such as pulsed field gel electrophoresis, multiple-loci VNTR analysis, multilocus sequence typing, and multiplex-PCR-based methods.[39][40]\\r\\nSalmonella species are facultative intracellular pathogens.[4] A facultative organism uses oxygen to make ATP: when it is not available it \\"exercises its option\\"the literal meaning of the termand makes ATP via fermentation, or by substituting one or more of four less efficient electron acceptors has oxygen at the end of the electron transport chain: sulfate, nitrate, sulfur, or fumarate.\\r\\nMost infections are due to ingestion of food contaminated by animal feces; or by human feces, such as by a food service worker at a commercial eatery. Salmonella serotypes can be divided into two main groupstyphoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella. Nontyphoidal serotypes are more common, and usually cause self-limiting gastrointestinal disease. They can infect a range of animals, and are zoonotic, meaning they can be transferred between humans and other animals. Typhoidal serotypes include Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A, which are adapted to humans and do not occur in other animals.\\r\\nInfection with nontyphoidal serotypes of Salmonella generally results in food poisoning. Infection usually occurs when a person ingests foods that contain a high concentration of the bacteria. Infants and young children are much more susceptible to infection, easily achieved by ingesting a small number of bacteria. In infants, infection through inhalation of bacteria-laden dust is possible.\\r\\nThe organisms enter through the digestive tract and must be ingested in large numbers to cause disease in healthy adults. An infection can only begin after living salmonellae (not merely Salmonella-produced toxins) reach the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the microorganisms are killed in the stomach, while the surviving ones enter the small intestine and multiply in tissues. Gastric acidity is responsible for the destruction of the majority of ingested bacteria, but Salmonella has evolved a degree of tolerance to acidic environments that allows a subset of ingested bacteria to survive.[41] Bacterial colonies may also become trapped in mucus produced in the esophagus. By the end of the incubation period, the nearby host cells are poisoned by endotoxins released from the dead salmonellae. The local response to the endotoxins is enteritis and gastrointestinal disorder.\\r\\nAbout 2,000 serotypes of nontyphoidal Salmonella are known, which may be responsible for as many as 1.4 million illnesses in the United States each year. People who are at risk for severe illness include infants, elderly, organ-transplant recipients, and the immunocompromised.[31]\\r\\nWhile in developed countries, nontyphoidal serotypes present mostly as gastrointestinal disease; in sub-Saharan Africa, these serotypes can create a major problem in bloodstream infections, and are the most commonly isolated bacteria from the blood of those presenting with fever. Bloodstream infections caused by nontyphoidal salmonellae in Africa were reported in 2012 to have a case fatality rate of 20ÿ25%. Most cases of invasive nontyphoidal salmonella infection (iNTS) are caused by S. typhimurium or S. enteritidis. A new form of Salmonella typhimurium (ST313) emerged in the southeast of the African continent 75 years ago, followed by a second wave which came out of central Africa 18 years later. This second wave of iNTS possibly originated in the Congo Basin, and early in the event picked up a gene that made it resistant to the antibiotic chloramphenicol. This created the need to use expensive antimicrobial drugs in areas of Africa that were very poor, making treatment difficult. The increased prevalence of iNTS in sub-Saharan Africa compared to other regions is thought to be due to the large proportion of the African population with some degree of immune suppression or impairment due to the burden of HIV, malaria, and malnutrition, especially in children. The genetic makeup of iNTS is evolving into a more typhoid-like bacterium, able to efficiently spread around the human body. Symptoms are reported to be diverse, including fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and respiratory symptoms, often with an absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.[42]\\r\\nTyphoid fever is caused by Salmonella serotypes which are strictly adapted to humans or higher primatesthese include Salmonella typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B and Paratyphi C. In the systemic form of the disease, salmonellae pass through the lymphatic system of the intestine into the blood of the patients (typhoid form) and are carried to various organs (liver, spleen, kidneys) to form secondary foci (septic form). Endotoxins first act on the vascular and nervous apparatus, resulting in increased permeability and decreased tone of the vessels, upset of thermal regulation, and vomiting and diarrhoea. In severe forms of the disease, enough liquid and electrolytes are lost to upset the water-salt metabolism, decrease the circulating blood volume and arterial pressure, and cause hypovolemic shock. Septic shock may also develop. Shock of mixed character (with signs of both hypovolemic and septic shock) is more common in severe salmonellosis. Oliguria and azotemia may develop in severe cases as a result of renal involvement due to hypoxia and toxemia.\\r\\nIn Germany, food poisoning infections must be reported.[43] From 1990 to 2005, the number of officially recorded cases decreased from about 200,000 to about 50,000 cases. In the United States, about 50,000 cases of Salmonella infection are reported each year.[44] A World Health Organization study estimated that 21,650,974 cases of typhoid fever occurred in 2000, 216,510 of which resulted in death, along with 5,412,744 cases of paratyphoid fever.[45]\\r\\nMechanisms of infection differ between typhoidal and nontyphoidal serotypes, owing to their different targets in the body and the different symptoms that they cause. Both groups must enter by crossing the barrier created by the intestinal cell wall, but once they have passed this barrier, they use different strategies to cause infection.\\r\\nNontyphoidal serotypes preferentially enter M cells on the intestinal wall by bacterial-mediated endocytosis, a process associated with intestinal inflammation and diarrhoea. They are also able to disrupt tight junctions between the cells of the intestinal wall, impairing the cells' ability to stop the flow of ions, water, and immune cells into and out of the intestine. The combination of the inflammation caused by bacterial-mediated endocytosis and the disruption of tight junctions is thought to contribute significantly to the induction of diarrhoea.[46]\\r\\nSalmonellae are also able to breach the intestinal barrier via phagocytosis and trafficking by CD18-positive immune cells, which may be a mechanism key to typhoidal Salmonella infection. This is thought to be a more stealthy way of passing the intestinal barrier, and may, therefore, contribute to the fact that lower numbers of typhoidal Salmonella are required for infection than nontyphoidal Salmonella.[46] Salmonella cells are able to enter macrophages via macropinocytosis.[47] Typhoidal serotypes can use this to achieve dissemination throughout the body via the mononuclear phagocyte system, a network of connective tissue that contains immune cells, and surrounds tissue associated with the immune system throughout the body.[46]\\r\\nMuch of the success of Salmonella in causing infection is attributed to two type III secretion systems which function at different times during an infection. One is required for the invasion of nonphagocytic cells, colonization of the intestine, and induction of intestinal inflammatory responses and diarrhea. The other is important for survival in macrophages and establishment of systemic disease.[46] These systems contain many genes which must work co-operatively to achieve infection.\\r\\nThe AvrA toxin injected by the SPI1 type III secretion system of S. Typhimurium works to inhibit the innate immune system by virtue of its serine/threonine acetyltransferase activity, and requires binding to eukaryotic target cell phytic acid (IP6).[48] This leaves the host more susceptible to infection.\\r\\nSalmonellosis is known to be able to cause back pain or spondylosis. It can manifest as five clinical patterns: gastrointestinal tract infection, enteric fever, bacteremia, local infection, and the chronic reservoir state. The initial symptoms are nonspecific fever, weakness, and myalgia among others. In the bacteremia state, it can spread to any parts of the body and this induces localized infection or it forms abscesses. The forms of localized Salmonella infections are arthritis, urinary tract infection, infection of the central nervous system, bone infection, soft tissue infection, etc.[49] Infection may remain as the latent form for a long time, and when the function of reticular endothelial cells is deteriorated, it may become activated and consequently, it may secondarily induce spreading infection in the bone several months or several years after acute salmonellosis.[49]\\r\\nA hallmark of Salmonella pathogenesis is the ability of the bacterium to survive and proliferate within phagocytes. Phagocytes produce DNA damaging agents such as nitric oxide and oxygen radicals as a defense against pathogens. Thus, Salmonella species must face attack by molecules that challenge genome integrity. Buchmeier et al.[50] showed that mutants of Salmonella enterica lacking RecA or RecBC protein function are highly sensitive to oxidative compounds synthesized by macrophages, and furthermore these findings indicate that successful systemic infection by S. enterica requires RecA and RecBC mediated recombinational repair of DNA damage.[50][51]\\r\\nSalmonella enterica, through some of its serotypes such as Typhimurium and Enteriditis, shows signs of the ability to infect several different mammalian host species, while other serotypes such as Typhi seem to be restricted to only a few hosts.[52] Some of the ways that Salmonella serotypes have adapted to their hosts include loss of genetic material and mutation. In more complex mammalian species, immune systems, which include pathogen specific immune responses, target serovars of Salmonella through binding of antibodies to structures like flagella. Through the loss of the genetic material that codes for a flagellum to form, Salmonella can evade a host's immune system.[53] In the study by Kisela et al., more pathogenic serovars of S. enterica were found to have certain adhesins in common that have developed out of convergent evolution.[54] This means that, as these strains of Salmonella have been exposed to similar conditions such as immune systems, similar structures evolved separately to negate these similar, more advanced defenses in hosts. There are still many questions about the way that Salmonella has evolved into so many different types but it has been suggested that Salmonella evolved through several phases. As Baumler et al. have suggested, Salmonella most likely evolved through horizontal gene transfer, formation of new serovars due to additional pathogenicity islands and through an approximation of its ancestry.[55] So, Salmonella could have evolved into its many different serotypes through gaining genetic information from different pathogenic bacteria. The presence of several pathogenicity islands in the genome of different serotypes has lent credence to this theory.[55]\\r\\nIn addition to its importance as a pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium has been instrumental in the development of genetic tools that led to an understanding of fundamental bacterial physiology. These developments were enabled by the discovery of the first generalized transducing phage, P22,[56] in Typhimurium that allowed quick and easy genetic exchange that allowed fine structure genetic analysis. The large number of mutants led to a revision of genetic nomenclature for bacteria.[57] Many of the uses of transposons as genetic tools, including transposon delivery, mutagenesis, construction of chromosome rearrangements, were also developed in Typhimurium. These genetic tools also led to a simple test for carcinogens, the Ames Test.[58]","input":"Salmonella spp. typically transmitted from animals to humans?"},{"output":"a revision and update of the Denver Developmental Screening Test, DDST","context":"The Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST), commonly known as the Denver Scale, is a test for screening cognitive and behavioral problems in preschool children. It was developed by William K. Frankenburg and first introduced by him and Josiah.B. Dobbs in 1967.[1] The test was previously marketed by Denver Developmental Materials, Inc., in Denver, Colorado, hence the name. As of June 8, 2015, the company has closed. However, the test, manuals, and other materials are available at no cost online at www.DenverII.com. The test kit can be ordered from Oxford,England, at www.hogrefe.co.uk. The test can be used in electronic medical records for free.[2]\\r\\nThe scale reflects what percentage of a certain age group is able to perform a certain task. In a test to be administered by a pediatrician or other health or social service professional, a subject's performance against the regular age distribution is noted. Tasks are grouped into four categories (social contact, fine motor skill, language, and gross motor skill) and include items such as smiles spontaneously (performed by 90% of three-month-olds), knocks two building blocks against each other (90% of 13-month-olds), speaks three words other than \\"mom\\" and \\"dad\\" (90% of 21-month-olds), or hops on one leg (90% of 5-year-olds).\\r\\nAccording to a study commissioned by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the DDST is the most widely used test for screening developmental problems in children.[3] While this study acknowledges the test's utility for detecting severe developmental problems, the test has been criticized to be unreliable in predicting less severe or specific problems. The same criticism has been upheld for the currently marketed revised version of the Denver Scale, the DENVER II.[4] Frankenburg has replied to such criticism by pointing out that the Denver Scale is not a tool of final diagnosis, but a quick method to process large numbers of children in order to identify those that should be further evaluated.[5]\\r\\nThis revised definition of the Denver's function remains commensurate with what screening tests are designed to do: sort those who probably have problems from those who probably don't. Thus standards for screening test construction still apply to the Denver. Although the instrument has proven reliability, it was not constructed on a large, current, nationally representative sample. It has not been studied for validity (given alongside diagnostic measures to view their relationship or researched for the kinds of problems it may or may not detect). As a consequence, the measure was not studied by its authors for the most critical attribute of any screen, its accuracy. Studies by other researchers showed it to detect only about 50% of children with disabilities, although its specificity in identifying normally developing children is high (when questionables are grouped with normal scores) and the converse when questionable scores are grouped with abnormal results. Since 1991, researchers have appealed to the author to recall and improve the measure but to no avail. Currently the measure is excluded from lists of recommended tools in several states (e.g., Minnesota Department of Education. For a list of accurate alternatives see The website of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Section on Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DENVER II (1992) is a revision and update of the Denver Developmental Screening Test, DDST (1967).[6][7] Both were designed for use by the clinician, teacher, or other early childhood professional to monitor the development of infants and preschool-aged children. Doing so, enables the clinician to identify children whose development deviates significantly from that of other children warranting further investigation to determine if there exists a problem requiring treatment. The tests cover four general functions: personal social (such as smiling), fine motor adaptive (such as grasping and drawing), language (such as combining words), and gross motor (such as walking). Ages covered by the tests range from birth to six years. Since its publication the test has enjoyed widespread popularity as reflected by its use in many of this nation's medical schools.\\r\\nThe DENVER II, published in 1992, was standardized on 2,096 children. Its interpretation was slightly modified from the DDST giving greater emphasis to a comparison of the child's performance on each item with the new norms, much as clinicians have compared children's growth on individual parameters as height, weight and head circumference to ascertain a child's health status.\\r\\nThere are five unique features of the test that generally differentiates it from most other developmental screening tests:\\r\\nThe above unique features of the test as well as its ease of administration and interpretation contribute to its widespread use in screening programs as public child health clinics, private practices, early education programs such as, nursery schools and day care centers. In fact, the DDST and the DENVER II test have been translated into numerous foreign languages, as well as re-standardized on over 1,000 children in each of 12 countries to obtain national norms, resulting in its use to screen millions of children throughout the world.\\r\\nIn 2006 the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Children with Disabilities; Section on Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics published a list of screening tests for clinicians to consider when selecting a test to use in their practice. This list includes the DENVER II among its choices.[12]\\r\\nMost recently, the Denver II has fallen out of favor with early childhood organizations. The Minnesota Department of Public Health stated, \\"The Denver II (1989) is no longer a recommended developmental screening instrument for use in Minnesota public programs?...

The final was contested by Brazil, who were the defending champions having won the previous FIFA World Cup four years earlier in 1994,[2] and the host nation France, who had reached the final of the tournament for the first time.[3]\\r\\nFrance won the match 3ÿ0 to claim the World Cup for the first time, with the timing of the match two days before Bastille Day adding to the significance of the victory.[4][5] Zinedine Zidane, who was named man of the match, scored twice before half-time and Emmanuel Petit added a third goal in the last minute. The match had an attendance in the region of 75,000.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn their way to the final, defending champions Brazil, coached by their former player Mrio Zagallo, recorded victories over Scotland (2ÿ1) and Morocco (3ÿ0) to top their group with six points from three matches, suffering a surprise 2ÿ1 defeat at the hands of Norway in their final group game. After a 4ÿ1 win over Chile and a 3ÿ2 success against Denmark, they reached the final with a penalty shoot-out victory over the Netherlands. As for France, they won their three group matches and defeated Paraguay in the knockout stages on golden goals. They had a penalty shoot-out with Italy in the quarter-finals, and defeated recently formed Croatia to reach the final.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe match also saw speculation on the condition of the Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who suffered a convulsive fit on the eve of the match.[6][7]\\r\\nAfter initially being left out of the team sheet, in spite of his physical state, it was announced just 72 minutes before kick-off that he was going to play.[4] In the match, he sustained an injury in a clash with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Although it was believed that the decision to play Ronaldo had backfired, it was understandable as the player had been a crucial member of the side throughout the tournament, having scored four goals and created three more.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance followed up their victory by qualifying for and winning UEFA Euro 2000 held in the Netherlands and Belgium.[9] Brazil took the Copa America title in 1999, and then won the next FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea in 2002.[10][11] Ronaldo went on to set the record for goals in World Cups, which was later broken by Miroslav Klose of Germany in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[12] Blanc and Deschamps both later had spells as manager of the France national team, with Deschamps leading them to a second World Cup title almost exactly 20 years later in the 2018 World Cup in Russia, making him only the third man to have won the World Cup as both player and manager after Zagallo and Germany's Franz Beckenbauer. Many of the French players who won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 are also part of the France 98 charity association, with Deschamps as president and Jacquet as coach for charity matches and testimonials.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Brazil, this marked only the second time that they had lost a World Cup final, following their 2ÿ1 upset loss to Uruguay in the de facto final of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, nicknamed the Maracanazo in Brazil. The 3ÿ0 scoreline was also Brazil's previous largest loss at any World Cup match prior to their 7ÿ1 loss to Germany in the 2014 FIFA World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrazil were drawn in Group A for the group stages alongside Scotland, Morocco and Norway. They recorded victories over Scotland (2ÿ1) and Morocco (3ÿ0) to progress but lost their final game 2ÿ1 to Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey next faced Group B runners-up Chile in the last-16 and comprehensively won 4ÿ1, Ronaldo and Csar Sampaio each scoring twice. In the quarter-finals, they played Denmark, who had also won their previous game 4ÿ1 (against Nigeria), but Brazil won a tight game 3ÿ2. Despite being 1ÿ0 down to a Martin Jorgensen goal in the second minute, Brazil turned the game around in their favour with goals from Bebeto (11) and Rivaldo (27). Brian Laudrup equalised for Denmark after 50 minutes but Brazil won the game 10 minutes later courtesy of a second from Rivaldo.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the semi-finals, Brazil faced the Netherlands in Marseille. The game finished 1ÿ1 at full-time, Ronaldo scoring just after half-time and Patrick Kluivert equalising for the Netherlands in the 87th minute, and the score remained the same through extra-time. The match had to be settled by penalties which Brazil won 4ÿ2 to reach their second successive World Cup final.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance were drawn in Group C alongside Denmark, South Africa and Saudi Arabia. They started their campaign with an easy 3ÿ0 win over South Africa followed by a convincing 4ÿ0 win over Saudi Arabia. France secured top spot in their group courtesy of a 2ÿ1 win over Denmark with goals from Youri Djorkaeff and Emmanuel Petit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second round, they faced Group D runners-up Paraguay. France won a close encounter 1ÿ0 in extra time thanks to a golden goal scored by Laurent Blanc. In the quarter-finals France faced Italy who had also scraped through to the quarter-finals with a 1ÿ0 win over Norway. A tense match ended 0ÿ0 after extra time and France won 4ÿ3 on penalties after Italy's Luigi Di Biagio struck his penalty onto the crossbar.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the semi-finals, France faced tournament surprise Croatia. After a goal-less first half, Croatia took the lead in the first minute of the second half through Davor ?uker, his fifth goal of the tournament. France responded immediately with Lilian Thuram scoring his first international goal. Thuram then added a second twenty minutes from time to send France to their first ever World Cup final. The match ended in controversy however when Laurent Blanc was sent off after a skirmish with Croatia's Slaven Bili?. Bili? had sunk down to his knees, seemingly in pain. Replays showed, however, that there was minimal contact between the players. Blanc's expulsion meant he would miss the final.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe build-up was dominated by the fitness of Brazil's star striker, Ronaldo, amid reports that he had suffered a pre-match fit.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nZinedine Zidane gave France the lead just before the half-hour mark with a header from an in-swinging corner from the right taken by Emmanuel Petit. Only minutes later, Ronaldo was put through on goal by a long ball from Dunga, but he could not get the better of the onrushing Fabien Barthez, who collided with the Brazilian striker. Both needed assistance from the squad medics but quickly recovered. Brazil's superstar playmakers Leonardo and Rivaldo were kept quiet by Didier Deschamps and Christian Karembeu.  As stoppage time began, France had an excellent chance to double their lead when a miscue by Brazil's two central defenders, Junior Baiano and Aldair, put Stphane Guivarc'h one on one with Claudio Taffarel, but the French striker hit a weak effort that was saved by Taffarel out for a corner. France doubled their lead a minute later, as Brazil could only clear the first corner out for another corner, this time from the left, Zidane scored another bouncing header that was almost identical to his first, to give the French a two-goal lead.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second half, Ronaldo had a chance to halve the deficit. The ball fell for him inside the penalty box, but he could only plant his shot into Barthez's arms. Brazil would have another chance when Denlson hit the bar from a good chance inside the penalty area.[14] Midfielder Emmanuel Petit wrapped up the scoring in the 90th minute, after receiving a through ball from his Arsenal teammate Patrick Vieira, slotting the ball low into the net. France had to play the last 20 minutes with only 10 men with the dismissal of Marcel Desailly.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMan of the Match:\\r\\nZinedine Zidane (France)\\r\\n\\r\\nAssistant referees:\\r\\nMark Warren (England)\\r\\nAchmat Salie (South Africa)\\r\\nFourth official:\\r\\nRahman Al Zaid (Saudi Arabia)\\r\\n\\r\\nMatch rules\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench President Jacques Chirac, International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch, the newly-elected FIFA president Sepp Blatter and his predecessor Jo?o Havelange, UEFA president Lennart Johansson, and co-president of local organizing committee Michel Platini were among those present at the stands during the awards ceremony.

They survive in large numbers and, through their inscriptions and typology, they are an important source of information for archaeologists and historians of the ancient world. They also represent a significant body of ancient art.\\r\\nFor reasons that are not clear (although no doubt connected to the religious significance of the Egyptian god Khepri), amulets in the form of scarab beetles had become enormously popular in Ancient Egypt by the early Middle Kingdom (approx. 2000 BCE) and remained popular for the rest of the pharaonic period and beyond. During that long period the function of scarabs repeatedly changed. Primarily amulets, they were also inscribed for use as personal or administrative seals or were incorporated into jewelry. Some scarabs were apparently created for political or diplomatic purposes to commemorate or advertise royal achievements. By the early New Kingdom, heart scarabs had become part of the battery of amulets protecting mummies.\\r\\nFrom the middle Bronze Age, other ancient peoples of the Mediterranean and the Middle East imported scarabs from Egypt and also produced scarabs in Egyptian or local styles, especially in the Levant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScarabs (beetles) were produced in vast numbers for many centuries and many thousands have survived. They were generally intended to be worn or carried by the living. They were typically carved or moulded in the form of a scarab beetle (usually identified as Scarabaeus sacer) with varying degrees of naturalism but usually at least indicating the head, wing case and legs but with a flat base. The base was usually inscribed with designs and/or hieroglyphs to form an impression seal. Scarabs were usually drilled from end to end to allow them to be strung on a thread or incorporated into a swivel ring. The most common of sizes for scarabs is from 6mm to 4?cm (length) and most are probably between 1?cm and 2?cm long. Larger scarabs were made from time to time for particular purposes (such as the commemorative scarabs of Amenhotep III). Heart scarabs (typically 5?cm to 9?cm long, made of dark hardstone and not pierced for suspension) were made for a specific funerary purpose and should be considered separately.\\r\\nScarabs were generally either carved from stone or moulded from Egyptian faience. Once carved, they would typically be glazed blue or green and then fired. The most common stone used for scarabs was a form of steatite, a soft stone which becomes hard when fired (forming enstatite). Hardstone scarabs were also made and the stones most commonly used were green jasper, amethyst and carnelian.\\r\\nWhile the majority of scarabs would originally have been green or blue the coloured glazes used have often either become discoloured or have been lost, leaving most steatite scarabs appearing white or brown.A scarab was often very light colors.\\r\\nIn ancient Egyptian religion, the sun god Ra is seen to roll across the sky each day, transforming bodies and souls. Beetles of the Scarabaeidae family (dung beetle) roll dung into a ball as food and as a brood chamber in which to lay eggs; this way, the larvae hatch and are immediately surrounded by food. For these reasons the scarab was seen as a symbol of this heavenly cycle and of the idea of rebirth or regeneration. The Egyptian god Khepri, Ra as the rising sun, was often depicted as a scarab beetle or as a scarab beetle-headed man. The ancient Egyptians believed that Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. A golden scarab of Nefertiti was discovered in the Uluburun wreck.[1]\\r\\nBy the end of the First Intermediate Period (about 2055 BCE) scarabs had become extremely common.[2] They largely replaced cylinder seals and circular \\"button seals\\" with simple geometric designs.[3] Throughout the period in which they were made, Scarabs were often engraved with the names of pharaohs and other royal persons. In the Middle Kingdom scarabs were also engraved with the names and titles of officials and used as official seals.[4] From the New Kingdom scarabs bearing the names and titles of officials became rarer, while scarabs bearing the names of gods, often combined with short prayers or mottos, like \\"With Ra behind there is nothing to fear\\" became more popular. These \\"wish\\" scarabs are often difficult to translate.\\r\\nAmenhotep III (immediate predecessor of Akhnaten) is famous for having commemorative scarabs made. These were large (mostly between 3.5?cm and 10?cm long) and made of steatite. They are beautifully crafted scarabs, apparently created under royal supervision or control and carry lengthy inscriptions describing one of five important events in his reign (and all of which mention his queen, Tiye). More than 200 examples have survived and they have been found in locations that suggest they were sent out as royal gifts/propaganda in support of Egyptian diplomatic activities. These large scarabs continued and developed an earlier Eighteenth Dynasty tradition of making scarabs celebrating specific royal achievements, such as the erection of obelisks at major temples during the reign of Thuthmosis III. The tradition was revived centuries later during the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, when the Kushite pharaoh Shabaka (721-707 BCE) had large scarabs made commemorating his victories in imitation of those produced for Amenhotep III.[5][6][7]\\r\\nAlthough scarab amulets were sometimes placed in tombs as part of the deceased's personal effects or as jewelry, generally they have no particular association with ancient Egyptian funerary rites. There are, however, three types of specifically funerary scarabs, heart scarabs, pectoral scarabs and naturalistic scarabs.\\r\\nHeart scarabs became popular in the early New Kingdom and remained in use until the Third Intermediate Period. They are large scarabs (typically 4?cm-12?cm long) often made from dark green or black stone and are not pierced for suspension. The base of a heart scarab was usually carved, either directly or on a gold plate fixed to the base, with hieroglyphs which name the deceased and repeat some or all of spell 30B from the Egyptian Book of the Dead. The spell commands the deceased's heart (typically left in the mummy's chest cavity, unlike the other viscera) not to give evidence against the deceased, when the deceased is being judged by the gods of the underworld. It is often suggested that the heart is being commanded not to give false evidence but the opposite may be true. The Book of the Dead requires the heart scarab to be made of green nemehef stone but a variety of green or dark coloured stones were used.[8] Heart scarabs were often hung around the mummy's neck with a gold wire and the scarab itself was held in a gold frame.\\r\\nFrom the Twenty-fifth Dynasty onwards large (typically 3?cm-8?cm long) relatively flat uninscribed pectoral scarabs were sewn, via holes formed at the edge of the scarab, onto the chests of mummies, together with a pair of separately made outstretched wings. These were mainly made from faience and glazed blue. The association of pectoral scarabs appears to be with the god Khepri, who is often depicted in the same form.\\r\\nA third kind of funerary scarab is the naturalistic scarab. These were relatively small scarabs (typically 2?cm to 3?cm long) made from a wide variety of hardstones and faience and are distinguished from other scarabs by having naturalistic carved \\"3D\\" bases, which often also include an integral suspension loop running widthways. Groups of these funerary scarabs, often made from different materials, formed part of the battery of amulets which protected mummies in the Late Period.[9]\\r\\nWhen a person died and went to their final judgment, the gods of the underworld would ask many detailed and intricate questions which had to be answered precisely and ritually, according to \\"The Egyptian Book of the Dead.\\" Since many people of those days were illiterate, even placing a copy of this scroll in their coffin would not be enough to protect them from being sent to Hell for giving a wrong answer. As a result, the priests would read the questions and their appropriate answers to the beetle, which would then be killed, mummified, and placed in the ear of the deceased. When the gods then asked their questions, the ghostly scarab would whisper the correct answer into the ear of the supplicant, who could then answer the gods wisely and correctly.[10]\\r\\nScarabs are often found inscribed with the names of pharaohs and more rarely with the names of their queens and other members of the royal family. Generally, the better established and longer reigning a king was, the more scarabs are found bearing one or more of his names.\\r\\nMost scarabs bearing a royal name can reasonably be dated to the period in which the person named lived. However, there are a number of important exceptions.\\r\\nScarabs are found bearing the names of pharaohs of the Old Kingdom (particularly of well-known kings such as Khufu, Khafra and Unas). It is now believed these were produced in later periods, most probably during the Twenty-fifth Dynasty or Twenty-sixth Dynasty, when there was considerable interest in and imitation of the works of great kings of the past.\\r\\nScarabs are also found in vast numbers which appear to bear the throne name of the New Kingdom king Thuthmosis III (1504-1450 BCE) Men Kheper Re (\\"the appearance of Ra is established\\"). Many of these scarabs do date from the long and successful reign of this great warrior pharaoh, or shortly thereafter but many, perhaps the majority, probably do not. Like all pharaohs, Thuthmosis was regarded as a god after his death. Unlike most pharaohs his cult, centered on his mortuary temple, seems to have continued for years, if not centuries. As a result, many scarabs bearing the inscription Men Kheper Re are likely to commemorate Thuthmosis III but may have been produced hundreds of years later. Later pharaohs adopted the same throne name (including Piye of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, 747-716 BCE) and this can lead to confusion. The hieroglyphs making Men Kheper Re seem to have become regarded as a protective charm in themselves and were inscribed on scarabs without any specific reference to Thuthmosis III. It can be doubted that in many cases the carver understood the meaning of the inscription but reproduced it blindly. On a lesser scale the same may be true of the throne name of Rameses II (1279-1212 BCE) User Maat Re (\\"the justice of Ra is powerful\\"), which is commonly found on scarabs which otherwise do not appear to date from his reign.\\r\\nThe birth names of pharaohs were also popular names among private individuals and so, for example, a scarab simply bearing the name \\"Amenhotep\\" need not be associated with any particular king who also bore that name.\\r\\nThe significance of a scarab bearing a royal name is unclear and probably changed over time and from scarab to scarab. Many may simply have been made privately in honour of a ruler during or after his lifetime. Some may also have been royal gifts. In some cases scarabs with royal names may have been official seals or badges of office, perhaps connected with the royal estates or household, others, although relatively few, may have been personal seals owned by the royal individual named on them. As the king fulfilled many different roles in ancient Egyptian society, so scarabs naming a pharaoh may have had a direct or indirect connection with a wide range of private and public activities.\\r\\nBack of scarab amulet\\r\\nAmulets: Scarab and Papyrus\\r\\nScarab with a cartouche\\r\\nScarab: top, and engravings.\\r\\nSignet ring, with cartouche of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun?:\\r\\n'Perfect God, Lord of the Two Lands'ÿ('Neter-Nefer, Neb-taui')\\r\\nFaience pectoral scarab with spread wings, The Walters Art Museum.\\r\\nFaience pectoral scarab with spread wings and bead net, Royal Pump Room, Harrogate\\r\\nA modern scarab produced for the tourist trade.\\r\\nAmenophis III lion hunt Scarab - top view, Royal Pump Room, Harrogate\\r\\nAmenophis III lion hunt Scarab - base view, Royal Pump Room, Harrogate","input":"What is the name of the egyptian beetle?"},{"output":"November 16, 1959","context":"The Sound of Music is a musical with music by Richard Rodgers, lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and a book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse. It is based on the memoir of Maria von Trapp, The Story of the Trapp Family Singers. Set in Austria on the eve of the Anschluss in 1938, the musical tells the story of Maria, who takes a job as governess to a large family while she decides whether to become a nun. She falls in love with the children, and eventually their widowed father, Captain von Trapp. He is ordered to accept a commission in the German navy, but he opposes the Nazis. He and Maria decide on a plan to flee Austria with the children. Many songs from the musical have become standards, such as \\"Edelweiss\\", \\"My Favorite Things\\", \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\", \\"Do-Re-Mi\\", and the title song \\"The Sound of Music\\".\\r\\nThe original Broadway production, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, opened in 1959[1] and won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical, out of nine nominations. The first London production opened at the Palace Theatre in 1961. The show has enjoyed numerous productions and revivals since then. It was adapted as a 1965 film musical starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, which won five Academy Awards. The Sound of Music was the last musical written by Rodgers and Hammerstein; Oscar Hammerstein died of cancer nine months after the Broadway premiere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter viewing The Trapp Family, a 1956 West German film about the von Trapp family, and its 1958 sequel (Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika), stage director Vincent J. Donehue thought that the project would be perfect for his friend Mary Martin; Broadway producers Leland Hayward and Richard Halliday (Martin's husband) agreed.[2] The producers originally envisioned a non-musical play that would be written by Lindsay and Crouse and that would feature songs from the repertoire of the Trapp Family Singers. Then they decided to add an original song or two, perhaps by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But it was soon agreed that the project should feature all new songs and be a musical rather than a play.[3]\\r\\nDetails of the history of the von Trapp family were altered for the musical. The real Georg von Trapp did live with his family in a villa in Aigen, a suburb of Salzburg. He wrote to the Nonnberg Abbey in 1926 asking for a nun to help tutor his sick daughter, and the Mother Abbess sent Maria. His wife had died in 1922. The real Maria and Georg married at the Nonnberg Abbey in 1927. Lindsay and Crouse altered the story so that Maria was governess to all of the children, whose names and ages were changed, as was Maria's original surname (the show used \\"Rainer\\" instead of \\"Kutschera\\"). The von Trapps spent some years in Austria after Maria and the Captain married and was offered a commission in Germany's navy. Since von Trapp opposed the Nazis by that time, the family left Austria after the Anschluss, going by train to Italy and then traveling on to London and the United States.[4] To make the story more dramatic, Lindsay and Crouse had the family, soon after Maria's and the Captain's wedding, escape over the mountains to Switzerland on foot.\\r\\nIn Salzburg, Austria, just before World War II, nuns from Nonnberg Abbey sing the Dixit Dominus. One of the postulants, Maria Rainer, is on the nearby mountainside, regretting leaving the beautiful hills (\\"The Sound of Music\\") where she was brought up. She returns late. The Mother Abbess and the other nuns consider what to do about her (\\"Maria\\"). Maria explains her lateness, saying she was raised on that mountain, and apologizes for singing in the garden without permission. The Mother Abbess joins her in song (\\"My Favorite Things\\").[5] The Mother Abbess tells her that she should spend some time outside the abbey to decide whether she is ready for the monastic life. She will act as the governess to the seven children of a widower, Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine Captain Georg von Trapp.\\r\\nMaria arrives at the villa of Captain von Trapp. He explains her duties and summons the children with a boatswain's call. They march in, clad in uniforms. He teaches her their individual signals on the call, but she openly disapproves of this militaristic approach. Alone with them, she breaks through their wariness and teaches them the basics of music (\\"Do-Re-Mi\\").\\r\\nRolf, a young messenger, delivers a telegram and then meets with the oldest child, Liesl, outside the villa. He claims he knows what is right for her because he is a year older than she (\\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\"). They kiss, and he runs off, leaving her squealing with joy. Meanwhile, the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, gives Maria material to make new clothes, as Maria had given all her possessions to the poor. Maria sees Liesl slipping in through the window, wet from a sudden thunderstorm, but agrees to keep her secret. The other children are frightened by the storm. Maria sings \\"The Lonely Goatherd\\" to distract them.\\r\\nCaptain von Trapp arrives a month later from Vienna with Baroness Elsa Schr?der and Max Detweiler. Elsa tells Max that something is preventing the Captain from marrying her. He opines that only poor people have the time for great romances (\\"How Can Love Survive\\"). Rolf enters, looking for Liesl, and greets them with \\"Heil\\". The Captain orders him away, saying that he is Austrian, not German. Maria and the children leapfrog in, wearing play-clothes that she made from the old drapes in her room. Infuriated, the Captain sends them off to change. She tells him that they need him to love them, and he angrily orders her back to the abbey. As she apologizes, they hear the children singing \\"The Sound of Music\\", which she had taught them, to welcome Elsa Schr?der. He joins in and embraces them. Alone with Maria, he asks her to stay, thanking her for bringing music back into his house. Elsa is suspicious of her until she explains that she will be returning to the abbey in September.\\r\\nThe Captain gives a party to introduce Elsa, and guests argue over the Anschluss. Kurt asks Maria to teach him to dance the L?ndler. When he fails to negotiate a complicated figure, the Captain steps in to demonstrate. He and Maria dance until they come face-to-face; and she breaks away, embarrassed and confused. Discussing the expected marriage between Elsa and the Captain, Brigitta tells Maria that she thinks Maria and the Captain are really in love with each other. Elsa asks the Captain to allow the children to say goodnight to the guests with a song, \\"So Long, Farewell\\". Max is amazed at their talent and wants them for the Kaltzberg Festival, which he is organizing. The guests leave for the dining room, and Maria slips out the front door with her luggage.\\r\\nAt the abbey, Maria says that she is ready to take her monastic vows; but the Mother Abbess realizes that she is running away from her feelings. She tells her to face the Captain and discover if they love each other, and tells her to search for and find the life she was meant to live (\\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\").\\r\\nMax teaches the children how to sing on stage. When the Captain tries to lead them, they complain that he is not doing it as Maria did. He tells them that he has asked Elsa to marry him. They try to cheer themselves up by singing \\"My Favorite Things\\" but are unsuccessful until they hear Maria singing on her way to rejoin them. Learning of the wedding plans, she decides to stay only until the Captain can arrange for another governess. Max and Elsa argue with him about the imminent Anschluss, trying to convince him that it is inevitable (\\"No Way to Stop It\\"). When he refuses to compromise, Elsa breaks off the engagement. Alone, the Captain and Maria finally admit their love, desiring only to be \\"An Ordinary Couple\\". As they marry, the nuns reprise \\"Maria\\" against the wedding processional.\\r\\nDuring the honeymoon, Max prepares the children to perform at the Kaltzberg Festival. Herr Zeller, the Gauleiter, demands to know why they are not flying the flag of the Third Reich now that the Anschluss has occurred. The Captain and Maria return early from their honeymoon before the Festival. In view of developments, he refuses to allow the children to sing. Max argues that they would sing for Austria, but the Captain points out that it no longer exists. Maria and Liesl discuss romantic love; Maria predicts that in a few years Liesl will be married (\\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen (Reprise)\\"). Rolf enters with a telegram that offers the Captain a commission in the German Navy, and Liesl is upset to discover that Rolf is now a committed Nazi. The Captain consults Maria and decides that they must secretly flee Austria. German Admiral von Schreiber arrives to find out why Captain von Trapp has not answered the telegram. He explains that the German Navy holds him in high regard, offers him the commission, and tells him to report immediately to Bremerhaven to assume command. Maria says that he cannot leave immediately, as they are all singing in the Festival concert; and the Admiral agrees to wait.\\r\\nAt the concert, after the von Trapps sing an elaborate reprise of \\"Do-Re-Mi\\", Max brings out the Captain's guitar. Captain von Trapp sings \\"Edelweiss\\", as a goodbye to his homeland, while using Austria's national flower as a symbol to declare his loyalty to the country. Max asks for an encore and announces that this is the von Trapp family's last chance to sing together, as the honor guard waits to escort the Captain to his new command. While the judges decide on the prizes, the von Trapps sing \\"So Long, Farewell\\", leaving the stage in small groups. Max then announces the runners-up, stalling as much as possible. When he announces that the first prize goes to the von Trapps and they do not appear, the Nazis start a search. The family hides at the Abbey, and Sister Margaretta tells them that the borders have been closed. Rolf comes upon them and calls his lieutenant, but after seeing Liesl he changes his mind and tells him they aren't there. The Nazis leave, and the von Trapps flee over the Alps as the nuns reprise \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\".\\r\\nSources: IBDB and Guidetomusicaltheatre.com[8]\\r\\nThe Sound of Music opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 16, 1959, moved to the Mark Hellinger Theatre on November 6, 1962, and closed on June 15, 1963, after 1,443 performances.

Jon Voight, who eventually married co-star Lauri Peters, was a replacement for Rolf. The national tour starred Florence Henderson as Maria and Beatrice Krebs as Mother Abbess. It opened at the Grand Riviera Theater, Detroit, on February 27, 1961, and closed November 23, 1963, at the O'Keefe Centre, Toronto. Henderson was succeeded by Barbara Meister in June 1962. Theodore Bikel was not satisfied playing the role of the Captain, because of the role's limited singing,[citation needed] and Bikel did not like to play the same role over and over again. In his autobiography, he writes: \\"I promised myself then that if I could afford it, I would never do a run as long as that again.\\"[12] The original Broadway cast album sold three million copies.\\r\\nThe musical premiered in London's West End at the Palace Theatre on May 18, 1961, and ran for 2,385 performances.

Michael Jayston played Captain von Trapp, Honor Blackman was the Baroness and June Bronhill the Mother Abbess. Other notable cast members included Helen Anker, John Bennett and Martina Grant.[14] Despite her misgivings that, at age 49, she was too old to play the role convincingly, Clark opened to unanimous rave reviews and the largest advance sale in the history of British theatre at that time. Maria von Trapp, who attended the opening night performance, described Clark as \\"the best\\" Maria ever. Clark extended her initial six-month contract to thirteen months. Playing to 101 percent of seating capacity, the show set the highest attendance figure for a single week (October 26ÿ31, 1981) of any British musical production in history (as recorded in The Guinness Book of Theatre).[15] It was the first stage production to incorporate the two additional songs (\\"Something Good\\" and \\"I Have Confidence\\") that Richard Rodgers composed for the film version.[16] \\"My Favorite Things\\" had a similar context to the film version, while the short verse \\"A Bell is No Bell\\" was extended into a full-length song for Maria and the Mother Abbess. \\"The Lonely Goatherd\\" was set in a new scene at a village fair.\\r\\nThe cast recording of this production was the first to be recorded digitally. It was released on CD for the first time in 2010 by the UK label Pet Sounds and included two bonus tracks from the original single issued by Epic to promote the production.\\r\\nDirector Susan H. Schulman staged the first Broadway revival of The Sound of Music, with Rebecca Luker as Maria and Michael Siberry as Captain von Trapp. It also featured Patti Cohenour as Mother Abbess, Jan Maxwell as Elsa Schrader, Fred Applegate as Max Detweiler, Dashiell Eaves as Rolf, Patricia Conolly as Frau Schmidt and Laura Benanti, in her Broadway debut, as Luker's understudy. Later, Luker and Siberry were replaced by Richard Chamberlain as the Captain and Benanti as Maria. Lou Taylor Pucci made his Broadway debut as the understudy for Kurt von Trapp. The production opened on March 12, 1998, at the Martin Beck Theatre, and closed on June 20, 1999, after 533 performances.

Following failed negotiations with Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson,[18] the role of Maria was cast through a UK talent search reality TV show called How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria? The talent show was produced by (and starred) Andrew Lloyd Webber and featured presenter/comedian Graham Norton and a judging panel of David Ian, John Barrowman and Zoe Tyler.\\r\\nConnie Fisher was selected by public voting as the winner of the show. In early 2007, Fisher suffered from a heavy cold that prevented her from performing for two weeks. To prevent further disruptions, an alternate Maria, Aoife Mulholland, a fellow contestant on How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, played Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinee performances. Simon Shepherd was originally cast as Captain von Trapp, but after two preview performances he was withdrawn from the production, and Alexander Hanson moved into the role in time for the official opening date along with Lesley Garrett as the Mother Abbess. After Garrett left, Margaret Preece took the role. The cast also featured Lauren Ward as the Baroness, Ian Gelder as Max, Sophie Bould as Liesl, and Neil McDermott as Rolf.

The production was directed by Charles Hickman, with musical numbers staged by Ernest Parham. The cast included June Bronhill as Maria, Peter Graves as Captain von Trapp and Rosina Raisbeck as Mother Abbess. A touring company then played for years, with Vanessa Lee (Graves' wife) in the role of Maria.

Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Post stated that the show had \\"strangely gentle charm that is wonderfully endearing. The Sound of Music strives for nothing in the way of smash effects, substituting instead a kind of gracious and unpretentious simplicity.\\"[65] The New York World-Telegram and Sun pronounced The Sound of Music \\"the loveliest musical imaginable. It places Rodgers and Hammerstein back in top form as melodist and lyricist. The Lindsay-Crouse dialogue is vibrant and amusing in a plot that rises to genuine excitement.\\"[65] The New York Journal American's review opined that The Sound of Music is \\"the most mature product of the team ... it seemed to me to be the full ripening of these two extraordinary talents\\".[65]\\r\\nBrooks Atkinson of The New York Times gave a mixed assessment. He praised Mary Martin's performance, saying \\"she still has the same common touch ... same sharp features, goodwill, and glowing personality that makes music sound intimate and familiar\\" and stated that \\"the best of the Sound of Music is Rodgers and Hammerstein in good form\\". However, he said, the libretto \\"has the hackneyed look of the musical theatre replaced with Oklahoma! in 1943. It is disappointing to see the American musical stage succumbing to the clichs of operetta.\\"[65] Walter Kerr's review in the New York Herald Tribune was unfavorable: \\"Before The Sound of Music is halfway through its promising chores it becomes not only too sweet for words but almost too sweet for music\\", stating that the \\"evening suffer(s) from little children\\".[65]\\r\\nColumbia Masterworks recorded the original Broadway cast album a week after the show's 1959 opening. The album was the label's first deluxe package in a gatefold jacket, priced $1 higher than previous cast albums.

Since it was recorded a week before the original Broadway cast album, Page was the first artist to record any song from the musical. She featured the song on her TV show, The Patti Page Olds Show, helping to popularize the musical.[citation needed] The 1960 London production was recorded by EMI and was issued on CD on the Broadway Angel Label.[69]\\r\\nThe 1965 film soundtrack was released by RCA Victor and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide.[70][71] Recent CD editions incorporate musical material from the film that would not fit on the original LP.

The English king, Edward II, assembled a formidable force to relieve it. This attempt failed, and his army was defeated in a pitched battle by a smaller army commanded by the King of Scots, Robert the Bruce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wars of Scottish Independence between England and Scotland began in 1296 and initially the English were successful under the command of Edward I, having won victories at the Battle of Dunbar (1296) and at the Capture of Berwick (1296).[10] The removal of John Balliol from the Scottish throne also contributed to the English success.[10] The Scots had been victorious in defeating the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297. This was countered, however, by Edward I's victory at the Battle of Falkirk (1298).[10] By 1304 Scotland had been conquered, but in 1306 Robert the Bruce seized the Scottish throne and the war was reopened.[10]\\r\\nEdward II of England came to the throne in 1307 but was incapable of providing the determined leadership that had been shown by his father, Edward I, and the English position soon became more difficult.[10] Stirling Castle was one of the most important castles that was held by the English as it commanded the route north into the Scottish Highlands.[10] It was besieged in 1314 by Robert the Bruce's brother, Edward Bruce, and an agreement was made that if the castle was not relieved by mid-summer then it would be surrendered to the Scots.[10] The English could not ignore this challenge and military preparations were made for a substantial campaign in which the English army probably numbered 2,000 cavalry and 15,000 infantry, many of whom would have been longbowmen.[10] The Scottish army probably numbered between 7,000 and 10,000 men, of whom no more than 500 would have been mounted.[10] Unlike the heavily armoured English cavalry, the Scottish cavalry would have been light horsemen who were good for skirmishing and reconnaissance but were not suitable for charging the enemy lines.[10] The Scottish infantry would have had axes, swords and pikes, with few bowmen among them.[10]\\r\\nThe precise size of the English force relative to the Scottish forces is unclear but estimates range from as much as at least two or three times the size of the army Bruce had been able to gather, to as little as only 50% larger.[11]\\r\\nEdward II and his advisors were aware of the places that the Scots were likely to challenge them and sent out orders for their troops to prepare for an enemy established in boggy ground near to the River Forth, near Stirling.[10] The English appear to have advanced in four divisions whereas the Scots were in three divisions, known as 'schiltrons' which were strong defensive circles of men bristling with pikes.[10] Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, commanded the Scottish vanguard, which was stationed about a mile to the south of Stirling, near the church of St. Ninian, while the king commanded the rearguard at the entrance to the New Park. His brother Edward led the third division. According to Barbour, there was a fourth division nominally under the youthful Walter the Steward, but actually under the command of Sir James Douglas.[12] The Scottish archers used yew-stave longbows and though these were not weaker than or inferior to English longbows, there were fewer Scottish archers than English archers,[13] possibly numbering only 500. These archers played little part in the battle.[14] There is firsthand evidence in a poem by the captured Carmelite friar Robert Baston, written just after the battle, that one or both sides employed slingers and crossbowmen.[15]\\r\\nThere is some confusion over the exact site of the Battle of Bannockburn,[16] although most modern historians agree that the traditional site,[17] where a visitor centre and statue have been erected, is not the correct one.[18] Although a large number of possible alternatives have been proposed, most can be dismissed leaving two serious contenders:[19]\\r\\nMost medieval battles were short-lived, lasting only a few hours, so that the Battle of Bannockburn is unusual in lasting two days.[10] On 23 June 1314 two of the English cavalry formations advanced, the first commanded by the Earl of Gloucester and the Earl of Hereford.[10] They encountered a body of Scots, among them Robert the Bruce himself.[10] A celebrated single combat then took place between Bruce and Henry de Bohun who was the nephew of the Earl of Hereford.[10] Bohun charged at Bruce and when the two passed side by side, Bruce split Bohun's head with his axe.[10][22] The Scots then rushed upon the English under Gloucester and Hereford who struggled back over the Bannockburn.[23]\\r\\nThe second English cavalry force was commanded by Robert Clifford and Henry de Beaumont and included Sir Thomas de Grey of Heaton, father of the chronicler Thomas Grey whose account of events follows;\\r\\nRobert Lord de Clifford and Henry de Beaumont, with three hundred men-at-arms, made a circuit upon the other side of the wood towards the castle, keeping the open ground. Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, Robert de Brus's nephew, who was leader of the Scottish advanced guard, hearing that his uncle had repulsed the advanced guard of the English on the other side of the wood, thought that he must have his share, and issuing from the wood with his division marched across the open ground towards the two afore-named lords.\\r\\nSir Henry de Beaumont called to his men: \\"Let us wait a little; let them come on; give them room\\"\\r\\n\\"Sir,\\" said Sir Thomas Gray, \\"I doubt that whatever you give them now, they will have all too soon\\"\\r\\n\\"Very well\\" exclaimed the said Henry, \\"if you are afraid, be off\\"\\r\\n\\"Sir,\\" answered the said Thomas, \\"it is not from fear that I shall fly this day.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder nightfall the English forces crossed the stream that is known as the Bannock Burn, establishing their position on the plain beyond it.[10] A Scottish knight, Alexander Seton, who was fighting in the service of Edward II of England, deserted the English camp and told Bruce of the low English morale, encouraging Bruce to attack them.[10] In the morning the Scots then advanced from New Park.[10]\\r\\nNot long after daybreak, the Scots spearmen began to move towards the English. Edward was surprised to see Robert's army emerge from the cover of the woods. As Bruce's army drew nearer, they paused and knelt in prayer. Edward is supposed to have said in surprise \\"They pray for mercy!\\" \\"For mercy, yes,\\" one of his attendants replied, \\"But from God, not you. These men will conquer or die.\\"[25] The English responded to the Scots advance with a charge of their own, led by the Earl of Gloucester. Gloucester had argued with the Earl of Hereford over who should lead the vanguard into battle, and argued with the king that the battle should be postponed. This led the king to accuse him of cowardice, which perhaps goaded Gloucester into the charge.[10] Few accompanied Gloucester in his charge and when he reached the Scottish lines he was quickly surrounded and killed.[10] Gradually the English were pushed back and ground down by the Scots' schiltrons.[10] The English longbowmen attempted to support the advance of the knights but were ordered to stop shooting, as they were causing casualties among their own. An attempt to deploy the English and Welsh longbowmen to shoot at the advancing Scots from their flank failed when they were dispersed by 500 Scottish cavalry under the Marischal Sir Robert Keith.[26] Although these are sometimes described as light cavalry, this appears to be a misinterpretation of Barbour's statement that these were men-at arms on lighter horses than their English counterparts.[27] The English cavalry was hemmed in, making it difficult for them to manoeuvre.[10] As a result, the English were unable to hold their formations and broke ranks.[10] It soon became clear to Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke and Giles d'Argentan (reputedly the third best knight in Europe) that the English had lost and Edward II needed to be led to safety at all costs. So, seizing his horse's reins, they dragged him away, closely followed by five hundred knights of the royal bodyguard.[28] Once they were clear of the battle d'Argentan turned to the king, said \\"Sire, your protection was committed to me, but since you are safely on your way, I will bid you farewell for never yet have I fled from a battle, nor will I now.\\" and turned his horse to charge back into the ranks of Scottish where he was overborne and slain.[29]\\r\\nEdward fled with his personal bodyguard, ending the remaining order in the army; panic spread and defeat turned into a rout. He arrived eventually at Dunbar Castle, from which he took ship to Berwick. From the carnage of Bannockburn, the rest of the army tried to escape to the safety of the English border, ninety miles to the south. Many were killed by the pursuing Scottish army or by the inhabitants of the countryside that they passed through. Historian Peter Reese says that, \\"only one sizeable group of menall foot soldiersmade good their escape to England.\\"[9] These were a force of Welsh spearmen who were kept together by their commander, Sir Maurice de Berkeley, and the majority of them reached Carlisle.[9] Weighing up the available evidence, Reese concludes that \\"it seems doubtful if even a third of the footsoldiers returned to England.\\"[9] Out of 16,000 infantrymen, this would give a total of about 11,000 killed. The English chronicler Thomas Walsingham gave the number of English men-at-arms who were killed as 700,[7] while 500 more men-at-arms were spared for ransom.[30] The Scottish losses appear to have been comparatively light, with only two knights among those killed.[31]\\r\\nThe defeat of the English opened up the north of England to Scottish raids[10] and allowed the Scottish invasion of Ireland.[26] These finally led, after the failure of the Declaration of Arbroath to reach this end by diplomatic means, to the Treaty of EdinburghÿNorthampton.[26] Under the treaty the English Crown recognised the full independence of the Kingdom of Scotland, and acknowledged Robert the Bruce, and his heirs and successors, as the rightful rulers.\\r\\nIn 1932 the Bannockburn Preservation Committee, under Edward Bruce, 10th Earl of Elgin and Kincardine, presented lands to the National Trust for Scotland. Further lands were purchased in 1960 and 1965 to facilitate visitor access. A modern monument stands in a field above the battle site, where the warring parties are believed to have camped on the night before the battle. The monument consists of two hemicircular walls depicting the opposing parties. Nearby stands the 1960s statue of Bruce by Pilkington Jackson. The monument, and the associated visitor centre, is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area. The battlefield has been included in the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland and protected by Historic Scotland under the Historic Environment (Amendment) Act 2011.[32]\\r\\nAlley to the monument\\r\\nStatue of Robert the Bruce by Pilkington Jackson\\r\\nView of the circular walls and the flag pole\\r\\nClose Up of the statue\\r\\nThe National Trust for Scotland operates the Bannockburn Visitor Centre (previously known as the Bannockburn Heritage Centre), which is open daily from March through October.

The project is a partnership between the National Trust for Scotland and Historic Scotland, funded by the Scottish Government and the Heritage Lottery Fund.[34] The battlefield's new visitor centre - now rebranded as the Bannockburn Visitor Centre - opened in March 2014. One of the attractions created by a S9m redevelopment of the centre and the nearby battlefield memorial is a computerised multiplayer game.[35]\\r\\n\\"Scots Wha Hae\\" is the title of a patriotic poem by Robert Burns.[37] The chorus of Scotland's unofficial national anthem Flower of Scotland refers to Scotland's victory over Edward and the English at Bannockburn. Many artworks depict the battle. John Duncan[38] and Eric Harald Macbeth Robertson[39] both painted Bruce's encounter with de Bohun. John Phillip painted Bruce receiving the sacrament on the eve of the battle.[40] John Hassall painted a similar theme.[41] William Findlay also depicts Bruce at the battle.[42]\\r\\nThe Swedish power metal band Sabaton wrote the song Blood of Bannockburn on their album The Last Stand.

Major categorization systems include cosmological (time periods in the origin and mass evolution of the universe), geological (time periods in the origin and evolution of the Earth), anthropological (time periods in the origin and evolution of humans) and historical (written history).\\r\\n\\r\\nThese can be divided broadly into prehistorical (before history began to be recorded) and historical periods (when written records began to be kept).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn archaeology and anthropology, prehistory is subdivided around the three-age system. This list includes the use of the three-age system as well as a number of various designation used in reference to sub-ages within the traditional three.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dates for each age can vary by region. On the geologic time scale, the Holocene epoch starts at the end of the last glacial period of the current ice age (c.10,000 BC) and continues to the present. The beginning of Mesolithic is usually considered to correspond to the beginning of the Holocene epoch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marxian theory of history identifies five major distinct periods of history:[8][9][10][11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Stage: is usually called primitive communism. It has the following characteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second Stage: may be called slave society, considered to be the beginning of \\"class society\\" where private property appears. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Third Stage: may be called feudalism; it appears after slave society collapses. This was most obvious during the European Middle Ages when society went from slavery to feudalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapitalism may be considered The Fourth Stage in the sequence. Marx pays special attention to this stage in human development. The bulk of his work is devoted to analysing the mechanisms of capitalism, which in western society classically arose \\"red in tooth and claw\\" from feudal society in a revolutionary movement. In capitalism, the profit motive rules and people, freed from serfdom, work for the capitalists for wages. The capitalist class are free to spread their laissez faire practices around the world. In the capitalist-controlled parliament, laws are made to protect wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapitalism appears after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrow the feudal system, and it is categorized by the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nBut according to Marx, capitalism, like slave society and feudalism, also has critical failings  inner contradictions which will lead to its downfall. The working class, to which the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits, is the \\"grave digger\\" of capitalism. The worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces. The rest is surplus value  the capitalist's profit, which Marx calls the \\"unpaid labour of the working class.\\"  The capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the working class to increase their profits, and this creates conflict between the classes, and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the working class. The working class, through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious of itself as an exploited class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the working class to establish its own collective control over production\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the working class gains class consciousness and mounts a revolution against the capitalists, socialism, which may be considered The Fifth Stage, will be attained, if the workers are successful. Marxist Socialism may be characterised as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nMarx explained that, since socialism, the first stage of communism, would be \\"in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges\\", each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor he contributes, despite the fact that each worker's ability and family circumstances would differ, so that the results would still be unequal at this stage, although fully supported by social provision.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe geologic time scale covers the extent of the existence of Earth, from about 4600 million years ago to the present day. It is marked by Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points. Geologic time units are (in order of descending specificity) eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages; and the corresponding chronostratigraphic units, which measure \\"rock-time\\", are eonothems, erathems, systems, series, and stages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second and third timelines are each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks.

It was reconstituted as a divisional formation (36th Brigade, 50th Armored Division) from 1988-92. In 1992 it became the 36th Brigade of the 49th Armored Division based at Houston, TX.

And I said, 'Hey, you're stepping over the line,' but at that point in life, I wouldn't put it past anyone,\\" he recalled.[4] He hoped to strike a balance \\"between humor and personality\\" with the song.[5] In writing the song, he was hoping to take influence from new wave and power pop music: \\"I was thinking a little bit about \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" and sonically I was thinking about the Cars, a Rick Springfield sort of thing.\\" He acknowledged that stylistically, the song \\"owes a debt\\" to the Cars' \\"Just What I Needed\\"; its opening guitar riff is similar.[6] Cars frontman Ric Ocasek thought that the intro was a sample from \\"Just What I Needed\\"[7] but the band says they performed it in the studio and just \\"got it right.\\"\\r\\n\\"Stacy's Mom\\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of October 11, 2003 at number 59, making this their first song to appear on that chart.[8] It entered the top 40 the week after by moving twenty-one spots to number 38 and moved nine spots to number 31 on the week of October 25, 2003.[9] It peaked at number 21 the week of November 21, 2003 and stayed there for two weeks.

Stacy's mother (Rachel Hunter) then pulls up in a red convertible in front of them to pick up Stacy. The boy and his friends gaze at her in awe. The boy later goes over to Stacy's house and is seen lying on a pool toy in her backyard swimming pool while wearing large, dark sunglasses. Through a window he sees Stacy's mother, and then watches her undress. Stacy gives the boy a bottle of soda and, as he sees Stacy's mother remove her bra, he spills soda on himself. As his eyes are hidden by his shades, Stacy laughs, thinking that he is just clumsy. After a scene with the band during the chorus, Stacy, in red heart-shaped sunglasses and swimsuit, is shown sunbathing while the boy mows her lawn. Stacy's mother comes out wearing just a towel and is given a massage on both her back and front. The masseur gives the boy a look of amusement, since he gets to look at Stacy's mother naked and the boy does not. The boy is distracted by the massage and ends up knocking over Stacy's birdhouse with the lawnmower. The video then cuts to him and Stacy watching Fountains of Wayne on TV, before the boy imagines Stacy's mother, while scrubbing the floors, as a pole dancer teasing him. Near the end of the video it is implied that the boy begins to masturbate by the bathroom window while Stacy's mother climbs out of the pool in her red bikini.[19] Moments later, Stacy opens the bathroom door, ignoring a sign saying Ocupado, and catches him in the act. Stacy quickly closes the door and starts smiling, implying that she believes the boy is masturbating to her and not her mother.[20]\\r\\nFountains of Wayne had asked Ric Ocasek to be in the video for the song. Schlesinger explains that while Ocasek claims that he \\"politely declined\\"; he actually just never responded to the request.[21] There are several references to The Cars in the video: a license plate reads \\"I ? RIC\\", a reference to Ric; one of the boys in the opening scene has dark hair, sunglasses, and clothes such that he looks like an adolescent version of Ocasek; the trademark Elliot Easton \\"bouncing\\" (at approximately 1:15 into the video) and hairdo as he plays his guitar for The Cars; and the re-creation of the Fast Times scene, which featured The Cars' \\"Moving in Stereo\\". Further links to The Cars and New Wave music are given by the magazine Nu Wave that is featured in the video, the Roland Juno-6 keyboard (a synthesizer of the 1980s), and the record sleeve showing 'Stacy's Mom' in a car.[22] The video reached No. 1 on both MTV's TRL and VH1's VSpot Top 20 Countdown.\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\nsales+streaming figures based on certification alone\\r\\nIn 2011, pop punk band Bowling for Soup released a cover version of \\"Stacy's Mom\\" as a B-side to their single \\"I've Never Done Anything Like This\\".[43]\\r\\nThe cover version came about because the original Fountains of Wayne song was often misattributed to Bowling For Soup.

In addition, six of the seven questions have a time limit; any money that is not placed on an answer when time runs out will be lost.

As a result of new information we have received from 3M, we feel it is only fair to give our contestants, Gabe and Brittany, another shot to play Million Dollar Money Drop even though this question was not the deciding question in their game.

Partially owing to the significance of the Bible in society, Biblical languages are studied more widely than many other dead languages. Furthermore, some debates exist as to which language is the original language of a particular passage, and about whether a term has been properly translated from an ancient language into modern editions of the Bible. Scholars generally recognize three languages as original biblical languages: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek.\\r\\nThe Hebrew Bible (Hebrew: ??\\"??), also known as the Tanakh, consists of 39 books. \\"Hebrew\\" in \\"Hebrew Bible\\" may refer to either the Hebrew language or to the Hebrew people who historically used Hebrew as a spoken language, and have continuously used the language in prayer and study, or both. The texts were mainly written in Biblical Hebrew, with some portions (notably in Daniel and Ezra) in Biblical Aramaic. Biblical Hebrew, sometimes called Classical Hebrew, is an archaic form of the Hebrew language.\\r\\nThe very first translation of the Hebrew Bible was into Greek. This is known as the Septuagint (LXX), which later became the received text of the Old Testament in the Catholic church and the basis of its canon. This began sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century BC, with the first portion of the Hebrew Bible, the Torah, being translated into Koine Greek. Over the next century, other books were translated (or composed) as well. This translation became known as the Septuagint and was widely used by Greek-speaking Jews, and later by Christians. It differs somewhat from the later standardized Hebrew (Masoretic Text). This translation was promoted by way of a legend that seventy separate translators all produced identical texts.\\r\\nThe Latin Vulgate by Jerome was based upon the Hebrew for those books of the Bible preserved in the Jewish canon (as reflected in the Masoretic Text), and on the Greek text for the rest. Other ancient Jewish translations, such as the Aramaic Targums, conform closely to the Masoretic Text, and all medieval and modern Jewish translations are based upon the same. Christian translations also tend to be based upon the Hebrew, though some denominations prefer the Septuagint (or may cite variant readings from both). Bible translations incorporating modern textual criticism usually begin with the Masoretic Text, but also take into account possible variants from all available ancient versions.\\r\\nThe books of the Christian New Testament are widely agreed to have originally been written in Greek, specifically Koine Greek, even though some authors often included translations from Hebrew and Aramaic texts. Certainly the Pauline Epistles were written in Greek for Greek-speaking audiences. See Greek primacy for further details. Koine Greek was the popular form of Greek which emerged in post-classical antiquity (c.300 BC ÿ AD 300), and marks the third period in the history of the Greek language.[1] It is also called Alexandrian, Hellenistic, Common, or New Testament Greek.\\r\\nSome scholars believe that some books of the Greek New Testament (in particular, the Gospel of Matthew) are actually translations of a Hebrew or Aramaic original. A famous example of this is the opening to the Gospel of John, which some scholars argue to be a Greek translation of an Aramaic hymn. Of these, a small number accept the Syriac Peshitta as representative of the original. See Aramaic primacy.\\r\\nHowever, the received text of the New Testament is Greek and nearly all translations are based upon the Greek text.","input":"What is the first language bible was written?"},{"output":"zero?g","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gravitational force, or more commonly, g-force, is a measurement of the type of acceleration that causes a perception of weight. Despite the name, it is incorrect to consider g-force a fundamental force, as \\"g-force\\" is a type of acceleration that can be measured with an accelerometer. Since g-force accelerations indirectly produce weight, any g-force can be described as a \\"weight per unit mass\\" (see the synonym specific weight). When the g-force acceleration is produced by the surface of one object being pushed by the surface of another object, the reaction force to this push produces an equal and opposite weight for every unit of an object's mass. The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. The g-force acceleration (except certain electromagnetic force influences) is the cause of an object's acceleration in relation to free fall.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe g-force acceleration experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of all non-gravitational and non-electromagnetic forces acting on an object's freedom to move. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface. Because of these strains, large g-forces may be destructive.\\r\\n\\r\\nGravitation acting alone does not produce a g-force, even though g-forces are expressed in multiples of the acceleration of a standard gravity. Thus, the standard gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface produces g-force only indirectly, as a result of resistance to it by mechanical forces. These mechanical forces actually produce the g-force acceleration on a mass. For example, the 1?g force on an object sitting on the Earth's surface is caused by mechanical force exerted in the upward direction by the ground, keeping the object from going into free fall. The upward contact force from the ground ensures that an object at rest on the Earth's surface is accelerating relative to the free-fall condition. (Free fall is the path that the object would follow when falling freely toward the Earth's center). Stress inside the object is ensured from the fact that the ground contact forces are transmitted only from the point of contact with the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nObjects allowed to free-fall in an inertial trajectory under the influence of gravitation only, feel no g-force acceleration, a condition known as zero-g (which means zero g-force). This is demonstrated by the \\"zero-g\\" conditions inside an elevator falling freely toward the Earth's center (in vacuum), or (to good approximation) conditions inside a spacecraft in Earth orbit. These are examples of coordinate acceleration (a change in velocity) without a sensation of weight. The experience of no g-force (zero-g), however it is produced, is synonymous with weightlessness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the absence of gravitational fields, or in directions at right angles to them, proper and coordinate accelerations are the same, and any coordinate acceleration must be produced by a corresponding g-force acceleration. An example here is a rocket in free space, in which simple changes in velocity are produced by the engines and produce g-forces on the rocket and passengers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unit of measure of acceleration in the International System of Units (SI) is m/s2. However, to distinguish acceleration relative to free fall from simple acceleration (rate of change of velocity), the unit g (or g) is often used.  One g is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface and is the standard gravity (symbol: gn), defined as 7000980665000000000?9.80665?metres per second squared,[3] or equivalently 7000980665000000000?9.80665?newtons of force per kilogram of mass. Note that the unit definition does not vary with locationthe g-force when standing on the moon is about 0.181?g.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unit g is not one of the SI units, which uses \\"g\\" for gram.  Also, \\"g\\" should not be confused with \\"G\\", which is the standard symbol for the gravitational constant.[4] This notation is commonly used in aviation, especially in aerobatic or combat military aviation, to describe the increased forces that must be overcome by pilots in order to remain conscious and not G-LOC (G-induced loss of consciousness).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeasurement of g-force is typically achieved using an accelerometer (see discussion below in Measurement using an accelerometer). In certain cases, g-forces may be measured using suitably calibrated scales. Specific force is another name that has been used for g-force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term g-force is technically incorrect as it is a measure of acceleration, not force. While acceleration is a vector quantity, g-force accelerations (\\"g-forces\\" for short) are often expressed as a scalar, with positive g-forces pointing downward (indicating upward acceleration), and negative g-forces pointing upward. Thus, a g-force is a vector acceleration. It is an acceleration that must be produced by a mechanical force, and cannot be produced by simple gravitation. Objects acted upon only by gravitation, experience (or \\"feel\\") no g-force, and are weightless.\\r\\n\\r\\nG-forces, when multiplied by a mass upon which they act, are associated with a certain type of mechanical force in the correct sense of the term force, and this force produces compressive stress and tensile stress. Such forces result in the operational sensation of weight, but the equation carries a sign change due to the definition of positive weight in the direction downward, so the direction of weight-force is opposite to the direction of g-force acceleration:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for the minus sign is that the actual force (i.e., measured weight) on an object produced by a g-force is in the opposite direction to the sign of the g-force, since in physics, weight is not the force that produces the acceleration, but rather the equal-and-opposite reaction force to it. If the direction upward is taken as positive (the normal cartesian convention) then positive g-force (an acceleration vector that points upward) produces a force/weight on any mass, that acts downward (an example is positive-g acceleration of a rocket launch, producing downward weight). In the same way, a negative-g force is an acceleration vector downward (the negative direction on the y axis), and this acceleration downward produces a weight-force in a direction upward (thus pulling a pilot upward out of the seat, and forcing blood toward the head of a normally oriented pilot).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a g-force (acceleration) is vertically upward and is applied by the ground (which is accelerating through space-time) or applied by the floor of an elevator to a standing person, most of the body experiences compressive stress which at any height, if multiplied by the area, is the related mechanical force, which is the product of the g-force and the supported mass (the mass above the level of support, including arms hanging down from above that level). At the same time, the arms themselves experience a tensile stress, which at any height, if multiplied by the area, is again the related mechanical force, which is the product of the g-force and the mass hanging below the point of mechanical support. The mechanical resistive force spreads from points of contact with the floor or supporting structure, and gradually decreases toward zero at the unsupported ends (the top in the case of support from below, such as a seat or the floor, the bottom for a hanging part of the body or object). With compressive force counted as negative tensile force, the rate of change of the tensile force in the direction of the g-force, per unit mass (the change between parts of the object such that the slice of the object between them has unit mass), is equal to the g-force plus the non-gravitational external forces on the slice, if any (counted positive in the direction opposite to the g-force).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a given g-force the stresses are the same, regardless of whether this g-force is caused by mechanical resistance to gravity, or by a coordinate-acceleration (change in velocity) caused by a mechanical force, or by a combination of these. Hence, for people all mechanical forces feels exactly the same whether they cause coordinate acceleration or not. For objects likewise, the question of whether they can withstand the mechanical g-force without damage is the same for any type of g-force. For example, upward acceleration (e.g., increase of speed when going up or decrease of speed when going down) on Earth feels the same as being stationary on a celestial body with a higher surface gravity. Gravitation acting alone does not produce any g-force; g-force is only produced from mechanical pushes and pulls. For a free body (one that is free to move in space) such g-forces only arise as the \\"inertial\\" path that is the natural effect of gravitation, or the natural effect of the inertia of mass, is modified. Such modification may only arise from influences other than gravitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples of important situations involving g-forces include:\\r\\n\\r\\nA classic example of negative g-force is in a fully inverted roller coaster which is accelerating (changing velocity) toward the ground. In this case, the roller coaster riders are accelerated toward the ground faster than gravity would accelerate them, and are thus pinned upside down in their seats. In this case, the mechanical force exerted by the seat causes the g-force by altering the path of the passenger downward in a way that differs from gravitational acceleration. The difference in downward motion, now faster than gravity would provide, is caused by the push of the seat, and it results in a g-force toward the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll \\"coordinate accelerations\\" (or lack of them), are described by Newton's laws of motion as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second Law of Motion, the law of acceleration states that: F =?ma., meaning that a force F acting on a body is equal to the mass m of the body times its acceleration a.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Third Law of Motion, the law of reciprocal actions states that: all forces occur in pairs, and these two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\\r\\nNewton's third law of motion means that not only does gravity behave as a force acting downwards on, say, a rock held in your hand but also that the rock exerts a force on the Earth, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an airplane, the pilots seat can be thought of as the hand holding the rock, the pilot as the rock. When flying straight and level at 1?g, the pilot is acted upon by the force of gravity. His weight (a downward force) is 725 newtons (163?lbf). In accordance with Newtons third law, the plane and the seat underneath the pilot provides an equal and opposite force pushing upwards with a force of 725?N (163?lbf). This mechanical force provides the 1.0 g-force upward proper acceleration on the pilot, even though this velocity in the upward direction does not change (this is similar to the situation of a person standing on the ground, where the ground provides this force and this g-force).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the pilot were suddenly to pull back on the stick and make his plane accelerate upwards at 9.8?m/s2, the total g?force on his body is 2?g, half of which comes from the seat pushing the pilot to resist gravity, and half from the seat pushing the pilot to cause his upward accelerationa change in velocity which also is a proper acceleration because it also differs from a free fall trajectory. Considered in the frame of reference of the plane his body is now generating a force of 1,450?N (330?lbf) downwards into his seat and the seat is simultaneously pushing upwards with an equal force of 1,450?N (330?lbf).\\r\\n\\r\\nUnopposed acceleration due to mechanical forces, and consequentially g-force, is experienced whenever anyone rides in a vehicle because it always causes a proper acceleration, and (in the absence of gravity) also always a coordinate acceleration (where velocity changes). Whenever the vehicle changes either direction or speed, the occupants feel lateral (side to side) or longitudinal (forward and backwards) forces produced by the mechanical push of their seats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expression \\"1 g = 7000980665000000000?9.80665?m/s2\\" means that for every second that elapses, velocity changes 7000980665000000000?9.80665 meters per second (7000980665000000000?35.30394?km/h). This rate of change in velocity can also be denoted as 7000980665000000000?9.80665 (meter per second) per second, or 7000980665000000000?9.80665?m/s2. For example: An acceleration of 1?g equates to a rate of change in velocity of approximately 35 kilometres per hour (22?mph) for each second that elapses. Therefore, if an automobile is capable of braking at 1?g and is traveling at 35 kilometres per hour (22?mph) it can brake to a standstill in one second and the driver will experience a deceleration of 1?g. The automobile traveling at three times this speed, 105?km/h (65?mph), can brake to a standstill in three seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of an increase in speed from 0 to v with constant acceleration within a distance of s this acceleration is v2/(2s).\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparing an object for g-tolerance (not getting damaged when subjected to a high g-force) is called g-hardening.[citation needed]   This may apply to, e.g., instruments in a projectile shot by a gun.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman tolerances depend on the magnitude of the g-force, the length of time it is applied, the direction it acts, the location of application, and the posture of the body.[7][8]:350\\r\\n\\r\\nThe human body is flexible and deformable, particularly the softer tissues. A hard slap on the face may briefly impose hundreds of g locally but not produce any real damage; a constant 16?g for a minute, however, may be deadly. When vibration is experienced, relatively low peak g levels can be severely damaging if they are at the resonance frequency of organs or connective tissues.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo some degree, g-tolerance can be trainable, and there is also considerable variation in innate ability between individuals. In addition, some illnesses, particularly cardiovascular problems, reduce g-tolerance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAircraft pilots (in particular) sustain g-forces along the axis aligned with the spine. This causes significant variation in blood pressure along the length of the subject's body, which limits the maximum g-forces that can be tolerated.\\r\\n\\r\\nPositive, or \\"upward\\" g, drives blood downward to the feet of a seated or standing person (more naturally, the feet and body may be seen as being driven by the upward force of the floor and seat, upward around the blood). Resistance to positive g varies. A typical person can handle about 5?g0 (49?m/s2) (meaning some people might pass out when riding a higher-g roller coaster, which in some cases exceeds this point) before losing consciousness, but through the combination of special g-suits and efforts to strain musclesboth of which act to force blood back into the brainmodern pilots can typically handle a sustained 9?g0 (88?m/s2) (see High-G training)[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn aircraft particularly, vertical g-forces are often positive (force blood towards the feet and away from the head); this causes problems with the eyes and brain in particular. As positive vertical g-force is progressively increased (such as in a centrifuge) the following symptoms may be experienced:\\r\\n\\r\\nResistance to \\"negative\\" or \\"downward\\" g, which drives blood to the head, is much lower. This limit is typically in the ?2 to ?3?g0 (?20 to ?29?m/s2) range.  This condition is sometimes referred to as red out where vision is figuratively reddened[11] due to the blood laden lower eyelid being pulled into the field of vision[12]  Negative g is generally unpleasant and can cause damage. Blood vessels in the eyes or brain may swell or burst under the increased blood pressure, resulting in degraded sight or even blindness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe human body is better at surviving g-forces that are perpendicular to the spine. In general when the acceleration is forwards (subject essentially lying on their back, colloquially known as \\"eyeballs in\\"[13]) a much higher tolerance is shown than when the acceleration is backwards (lying on their front, \\"eyeballs out\\") since blood vessels in the retina appear more sensitive in the latter direction[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly experiments showed that untrained humans were able to tolerate a range of accelerations depending on the time of exposure. This ranged from as much as 20?g for less than 10 seconds, to 10?g for 1 minute, and 6?g for 10 minutes for both eyeballs in and out.[14] These forces were endured with cognitive facilities intact, as subjects were able to perform simple physical and communication tasks. The tests were determined to not cause long or short term harm although tolerance was quite subjective, with only the most motivated non-pilots capable of completing tests.[15] The record for peak experimental horizontal g-force tolerance is held by acceleration pioneer John Stapp, in a series of rocket sled deceleration experiments culminating in a late 1954 test in which he was clocked in a little over a second from a land speed of Mach 0.9. He survived a peak \\"eyeballs-out\\" acceleration of 46.2 times the acceleration of gravity, and more than 25?g for 1.1 seconds, proving that the human body is capable of this. Stapp lived another 45 years to age 89[16] without any ill effects.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest recorded G-force experienced by a human who survived was during the 2003 IndyCar Series finale at Texas Motor Speedway on October 12, 2003 in the 2003 Chevy 500 when the car driven by Kenny Br?ck made wheel-to-wheel contact with Tomas Scheckter's car. This immediately resulted in Br?ck's car impacting the catch fence that would record a peak of 214 G-force.\\r\\n[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nImpact  and mechanical shock are usually used to describe a high kinetic energy, short term excitation.  A shock pulse is often measured by its peak acceleration in g-s and the pulse duration. Vibration is a periodic oscillation which can also be measured in g-s as well as frequency.  The dynamics of these phenomena are what distinguish them from the g-forces caused by a relatively longer term accelerations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a free fall from a height \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nh\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle h}\\r\\n\\r\\n the shock on an object during impact is \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nh\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle h/d}\\r\\n\\r\\n g, where \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle d}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the distance covered during the impact. For example, a stiff and compact object dropped from 1 m that impacts over a distance of 1?mm is subjected to a 1000 g deceleration.\\r\\n\\r\\nJerk is the rate of change of acceleration. In SI units, jerk is expressed as m/s3; it can also be expressed in standard gravity per second (g/s; 1 g/s  9.81?m/s3).\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent research carried out on extremophiles in Japan involved a variety of bacteria including E. coli and Paracoccus denitrificans being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an ultracentrifuge at high speeds corresponding to 403,627?g. Paracoccus denitrificans was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually only to be found in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of supernovas. Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful growth under hypergravity. The research has implications on the feasibility of panspermia.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\n* Including contribution from resistance to gravity.\\r\\n? Directed 40 degrees from horizontal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accelerometer, in its simplest form, is a damped mass on the end of a spring, with some way of measuring how far the mass has moved on the spring in a particular direction, called an 'axis'.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccelerometers are often calibrated to measure g-force along one or more axes. If a stationary, single-axis accelerometer is oriented so that its measuring axis is horizontal, its output will be 0?g, and it will continue to be 0?g if mounted in an automobile traveling at a constant velocity on a level road. When the driver presses on the brake or gas pedal, the accelerometer will register positive or negative acceleration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the accelerometer is rotated by 90 so that it is vertical, it will read +1?g upwards even though stationary. In that situation, the accelerometer is subject to two forces: the gravitational force and the ground reaction force of the surface it is resting on. Only the latter force can be measured by the accelerometer, due to mechanical interaction between the accelerometer and the ground. The reading is the acceleration the instrument would have if it were exclusively subject to that force.\\r\\n\\r\\nA three-axis accelerometer will output zero?g on all three axes if it is dropped or otherwise put into a ballistic trajectory (also known as an inertial trajectory), so that it experiences \\"free fall,\\" as do astronauts in orbit (astronauts experience small tidal accelerations called microgravity, which are neglected for the sake of discussion here).

They chronicle the adventures of the Grace children, twins Simon and Jared and their older sister Mallory, after they move into the Spiderwick Estate and discover a world of fairies that they never knew existed. The first book, The Field Guide, was published in 2003 and then followed by The Seeing Stone (2003), Lucinda's Secret (2003), The Ironwood Tree (2004), and The Wrath of Mulgarath (2004). Several companion books have been published including Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You (2005), Notebook for Fantastical Observations (2005), and Care and Feeding of Sprites (2006). A second series, entitled Beyond the Spiderwick Chronicles includes The Nixie's Song (2007), A Giant Problem (2008), and The Wyrm King (2009). A feature film adaptation, also titled The Spiderwick Chronicles, was produced by Nickelodeon Movies and premiered on February 14, 2008; an accompanying video game was released in early February 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Field Guide, the first book in the series, was published in May 2003. It opens in Maine, where nine-year-old identical twins Jared and Simon and their thirteen-year-old sister Mallory move into the decrepit Spiderwick Estate with their mother, Helen. On the first night, they discover a secret library on the second floor using a dumbwaiter. They later discover that the library connects to the rest of the house via a hidden door in a hall closet. A brownie named Thimbletack, who has lived in the house for years, becomes angry with the Grace children when they destroy his nest inside the walls, and Jared is blamed for the ensuing havoc wrought by the brownie in retaliation including assaults on Mallory, Simon, and the trashing of the kitchen. Following a clue in the form of a riddle-poem, Jared finds Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You in a secret compartment in a trunk in the attic. The Field Guide is an old hand-written and illustrated book with information on different types of faeries. The novel ends as the Grace children make amends with Thimbletack by building him a new home out of an old birdhouse. Thimbletack then warns them that the book which they found is dangerous and was not meant to be in the hands of mortals.\\r\\nThe Seeing Stone was published alongside the first book in May 2003. After the Grace children ignore Thimbletack's warning to destroy the Guide, Simon is abducted by a group of invisible goblins who live in the woods surrounding the house. Thimbletack leads Jared and Mallory to the old carriage house where they find a \\"seeing stone\\" (a stone with a natural hole in it) which gives the wearer, in this case Jared, the ability to see faeries (called the Sight). After Jared and Mallory narrowly avoid being captured by the goblins, they go searching for Simon in the woods. On their way through the forest, they encounter a troll residing in the river by a decrepit stone bridge. Partially protected by the daylight, they are able to avoid it, but lose their fencing weapons. After encountering a wounded griffin, they find the goblin camp and a plethora of prisoners hanging in cages made from refuse from the trees. While trying to rescue Simon, they meet a prisoner named Hogsqueal, a hobgoblin, who convinces them to help him escape in exchange for his help in rescuing Simon. Hogsqueal offers to spit in their eyes, which gives them the Sight without using the stone. Hogsqueal distracts the goblins from the children's escape and in return, Jared, Simon, and Mallory attract the goblins' attention away from Hogsqueal and then flee, leading the goblins back to the troll. Jared convinces the troll to let them escape in return for leading the goblins to him to eat. After they arrive home, Simon convinces them to return to the now empty camp to release the rest of the goblins' victims and they take the injured griffin to the carriage house. After confronting their scared and angry mother, they discover that Thimbletack, enraged at Jared's forceful taking of the seeing stone, has again become a Boggart and reverted to his mischievous ways after every thing happen.\\r\\nLucinda's Secret was published on October 1, 2003. The novel opens upon an argument among the Grace children on whether or not to destroy the Field Guide, Jared alone insisting that they keep it. They eventually agree to consult their Great-Aunt Lucinda, who is now staying in a psychiatric hospital and is the only person whom they know to have been in contact with Arthur Spiderwick, who was her father. When they ask her about Arthur, it is revealed that the last she saw him was one day when she was a little girl, on which Arthur had set out from the house on foot and never returned. She is horrified that the Grace family is staying at the Estate, which she says is not safe, and even more worried when she hears that they have the Guide, believing her father to have taken it with him when he disappeared. However, when Jared takes the book from his backpack to show her, it has been replaced with another book, presumably by Thimbletack. Once home, the Grace children decide to find out what happened to their great-great uncle, and set out from the Estate with a map of the area on which is written \\"September 14th. Five O'clock. Bring the remains of the book.\\" On their journey they meet a Phooka: a creature that talks only in riddles. They finally reach a river grove inhabited by thieves, who threaten to trap one of the children there unless the guide is given to them. The children flee, however, promising to bring the Guide as soon as they can. On passing by the Phooka again, one of his riddles leads them to think that Arthur is still alive, but imprisoned in Faerie with the elves.\\r\\nThe Ironwood Tree was published on April 6, 2004. The family attends Mallory's fencing meet at school. During the tournament, Jared finds a boy identical to him going through Mallory's bag. He transforms into a smaller child when Jared attempts to scare him with his pocket knife. When Jared and Simon discover that Mallory has disappeared, they search for her in an abandoned quarry, but wind up being kept prisoner by dwarves. Mallory is revealed to be sleeping in a glass-coffin dressed in medieval garb (similarly to Snow White), with the dwarves saying she is now immortal, so long as she stays in the coffin. Escaping their cage, the twins free Mallory and meet a strange creature, called a Knocker, who tells them the way out by listening to the stones. They next see a huge metal tree, made by the dwarves, called the Ironwood Tree. After a narrow escape from the dwarves' mechanical dogs, they make their way out of the tunnel but have to hide before leaving. They secretly watch Mulgarath, a hideous ogre who wants to rule the world, callously order the death of the dwarves for having been tricked into not getting the Field Guide from Jared. The dwarves are mauled to death by the goblins and Mulgarath reveals that he had the Guide the whole time. The siblings escape just after Mulgarath leaves with his goblins and the weapons made by the dwarves\\r\\nThe Wrath of Mulgarath was published on September 7, 2004. The Grace children return from the quarry to the Spiderwick estate, only to find the house in ruins and their mother gone. Hogsqueal the hobgoblin informs them that the house was destroyed by the goblins who have kidnapped their mother and taken her to the palace of their fearsome master, Mulgarath the ogre. Accompanied by Hogsqueal, the siblings journey to Mulgarath's palace, an immense citadel made of garbage where they battle a legion of goblins. Mallory runs the leader through with her sword and is greatly traumatized by having actually killed a living sentient being. Nevertheless, she and her brothers defeat the goblins and discover Mulgarath's plan. The ogre has learned from the Field Guide that fresh cows' milk makes young dragons rapidly mature. He has stolen a number of cows and is using them to breed an army of dragons with which he plans to conquer the world. Byron, the griffin, successfully vanquishes the mother dragon and Simon kills the young ones. Infiltrating the palace, they find their mother and father tied up. They release their father, but discover that he is actually Mulgarath in disguise. Jared has Thimbletack wrap chains around Simon and Mallory. The ogre brags of his plan and reveals that the Field Guide is underneath his throne, and Jared mockingly tells Mulgarath that he and his siblings have killed all the dragons. In a rage, Mulgarath flings Simon and Mallory out of the window but Thimbletack's chains hold, and they don't fall far. Jared stabs Mulgarath in the foot with Mallory's sword, then knocks him out of the window. Mulgarath falls, transforms into a swallow to escape, and is eaten by Hogsqueal.\\r\\nThe children return home, where they meet Arthur Spiderwick, who had been living with the elves and so had not aged. He and his daughter Lucinda, now an old woman, share a poignant goodbye, and he turns to dust. With Mulgarath defeated, the Grace family is presumably now free to live happily ever after.\\r\\nThis story takes place in Florida, where 11-year-old Nick Vargas lives with his brother, Jules, his weird stepsister, Laurie, his father, Paul, and his stepmother, Charlene, in his father's housing development. Laurie has read the Spiderwick Chronicles and believes in faeries. Nick thinks she is \\"lame\\" and wishes she would leave him alone. After finding a four-leafed clover (which allows people to see faeries) he sees a nixie unconscious in his yard, which he and Laurie carry into a nearby artificial pond.\\r\\nIn the following day, the Nixie, named Taloa, gives Nick and Laurie the Sight and sends them to find her six sisters, who were separated when their pond was destroyed. They leave after a faerie fills Nick's father's car with sand to look for Taloa's sisters at her old pond. They find the pond dried, the surrounding forest burnt and the bodies of three of the nixies, accidentally waking up a giant, which they mistook for a hill. They flee from the giant, who becomes hypnotized and calm when it hears Taloa's singing.\\r\\nThe children decide to ask the authors of The Spiderwick Chronicles themselves for advice at a book signing, convincing Jules to drive them. Once there, they are disappointed when Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black don't believe them, but they then run into Jared and Simon Grace, who offer to help them gather useful information. Jared tells them about a giant expert who lived nearby and they plan to meet at his address. The place appears to be deserted, and after a quick incident with will-o'-the-wisps, the kids take several papers including a diagram of a giant trap. While the giant is hypnotized by the nixie's song, the three kids use a rope to tie the giant's foot to its neck. It thrashes around, strangling itself with the cords, leaving the kids horrified at what they've done. When the giant stops moving, an old man called Noseeum Jack (\\"Noseeum\\" due to his poor eyesight, and \\"Jack\\" being a reference to the story of Jack the Giant-Killer) approaches, revealing to be the son of the giant expert who met Arthur Spiderwick, and a giant slayer himself, killing the giant definitely. He explains that the giants sleep for 500 years at a time and all wake up at once, bringing panic and destruction to anywhere they go, and that soon all of Florida's giants would be waking up.\\r\\nNick and Laurie start taking giant hunting lessons from Noseeum Jack, which Nick finds pointless. One night, Jack shows up at their house when their parents are fighting and takes them to see a fight between two giants who had woken up too close to each other. He approaches one of them when it gets injured and is swatted away, hurting his leg. The kids help him to his house and, once home, Laurie gives Jules a keychain containing the four-leafed clover (which they no longer need, having been given permanent Sight by Taloa).\\r\\nThe next day they find a small faerie (who Nick has seen days before) playing with a message that Taloa had left for them, saying she had gone look for her surviving sisters alone. They catch the little faerie, whom Laurie names Sandspur and assumes to be a hobgoblin, based on the Field Guide. Later that day, two giants start fighting near their house. They escape with Jules, who can see the giants, but most of the development is destroyed. They go to Jack's house for help, but instead meet Jack's son (simply called Jack Junior), who tells them that he's taking his father to live with him and his wife. Noseeum Jack apologizes to Nick for not helping them and tells him he kept something for them in his backyard, which Nick doesn't even bother to investigate.\\r\\nThat night, the family stays at a hotel where they try to come up with a plan and Jules shows Sandspur to his girlfriend, Cindy. Based on the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Nick thinks about the possibility of asking the merfolk to lure the giants to the sea, since they seem to be hypnotized by a nixie's singing. The kids sneak out to the beach, where they find that the mermaids hate land-dwellers and kidnap Jules, promising to let him go and sing the giants to the sea if the kids bring them a fish that has never been in their sea. They steal a tropical fish from Cindy's father's aquarium and race back to the beach. The mermaids are amazed that they completed the task and return Jules. Keeping their promise but intending to trick the humans, the mermaids sing for only a little while and to no effect before disappearing. However, Nick manages to tape their song in a tape recorder, which they intend to use to lure the giants themselves.\\r\\nAfter getting Nick's model Viking ship from the hotel, they drive around a route provided by Sandspur of where the giants are, playing the mermaids' song. The giants follow the sound to the sea, where Nick drops the little boat (with the tape recorder) into the ocean. The giants follow it out to sea and the kids go back to the hotel where they find the Grace kids waiting for them with the news that the giants woke up all at the same time because they were there to kill something even worse.\\r\\nThe last book of the Spiderwick Saga, the story starts with the Vargas family going to a family therapist because of the children's latest strange behaviour, which Nick's father thinks is caused by his remarrying. Meanwhile, sinkholes have been appearing everywhere throughout Florida, where small black serpent-like creatures are vaguely seen by Nick. Under the assumption that these sinkholes are caused by the creatures that the giants were supposed to destroy, the Vargas kids (plus Sandspur) meet up with Jared, Simon and Mallory at Noseeum Jack's house, which is now deserted and has a massive sinkhole in the front yard. After breaking into the house, they find more of Jack's annotations, which compare the hydra, shown as a group of intertwined wyrm dragons, to the legend of the Rat King.\\r\\nFinally going to Jack's backyard, Nick and Laurie find what Jack had meant to give them: a small pool filled with lime and muck with Taloa and two of her sisters, Ooki and Ibi, whom Jack had captured some days earlier. Meanwhile, Mallory goes into the sinkhole to investigate, but finds herself unable to breathe and surrounded by the small snake-like dragons. They manage to get her out and put three of the creatures in a jar. They figure that the creatures produce methane, which makes the air around them unbreathable, and realize that these were the creatures that the giants ate in order to breathe fire (which they originally believed to be salamanders).\\r\\nSeeing how fast the dragons can grow after feeding them a chunk of pizza, the children all drive to the beach in order to get the giants back to land so they can kill the dragons. The three nixies eventually agree to use their singing to lure the giants, and one of them is taken to the water with Nick and Jared in a surfboard (because since nixies are used to freshwater, salt water hurts their skin). Before they can accomplish this, however, Nick is taken underwater by the merfolk, who tell him how they're glad that the land-dwellers are doomed and give him a magical cap in the process that allows him to breathe underwater. The nixies manage to get some of the giants to follow them to land, where they immediately start eating the small reptiles and fighting each other again. As the children drive away from the giants, their car falls into a sinkhole and only after some time do they manage to get out. A giant then attacks them, being saved by the showing up of Jack Junior, who suddenly decided to listen to his father and come help the children kill the giants (being surprised when they reveal him that killing giants is no longer their plan).\\r\\nAfter dropping the nixies in a nearby pond (their reward for having sung to the giants), Jules, Laurie and Nick pass by Cindy's house and notice a large sinkhole close to it. When they go to warn Cindy and her parents, Laurie and Sandspur fall into the growing sinkhole and a tree falls on Jules's legs when attempting to rescue her. When Nick tries to help Laurie get out of the sinkhole, he finds that she still hadn't died from the methane exhaled by the dragons because Sandspur (who had grown to a huge size, revealing himself to be a spriggan) had been eating them, proceeding to eat Nick whole and only regurgitating him when Laurie drops rocks into the creature's mouth to make him sick. Nick and Laurie get out of the sinkhole and go back to meet Jack Jr. and the Grace kids, leaving Jules at Cindy's house waiting for an ambulance (being followed back by Sandspur, back in his small size, like nothing had happened).\\r\\nNoticing that all sinkholes are connected, they come to the conclusion that the biggest hydra must be in the center, laying the eggs that hatch into the smaller hydras who wander through the tunnels. They notice that the giants are all going to meet that alpha hydra, and Jack Junior leaves to go kill it, followed by the children. There, they meet the giant multi-headed dragon, who had already started to kill the giants that had gathered to fight it. After hurting Jack Junior and the Grace kids, Nick has an idea and realizes it's up to him to save the day. Using the cap given to him by the merfolk so he could safely breathe, he goes into one of the tunnels with Jack's machete so to meet the hydra from below. When he gets there, instead of trying to kill the beast, he cuts the substance that keeps all the dragons together, thus making them separate from each other and easier for the giants to kill.\\r\\nAt the hospital, all the children get their injuries treated, Jules gets back with Cindy, Jack calls his father to tell him what happened, the Grace kids meet their father there and the Vargas family decides to all stay together. The Spiderwick Saga ends with the Vargas going home, being watched by a silent giant in the distance.\\r\\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles:\\r\\nBeyond the Spiderwick Chronicles:\\r\\nIn the Spiderwick universe, faeries usually remain invisible or disguised to human eyes, who are generally not aware of their presence. However, a small percentage of humans have the ability to see faeries, commonly called the 'Sight', acquired naturally (for example, by being the seventh son of a seventh son or having red hair) or artificially (by looking through a holed stone or possessing a four-leafed clover). In the series, the Grace children receive the Sight when the hobgoblin Hogsqueal spits in their eyes, and the Vargas kids receive it when they are held under the water that a nixie had been soaking in.\\r\\nThey are portrayed as living many years, so many of the faeries encountered by the main characters also met Arthur Spiderwick and other long-dead humans in the past, without having aged. The species of fairies in the series are mainly taken from European mythology and folklore and Medieval bestiaries, including brownies, goblins, dragons, sprites, and elves, among many others.\\r\\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles:\\r\\nBeyond the Spiderwick Chronicles:\\r\\nDiTerlizzi stated that, due to the collaborative effort he and Black put into the books, there is no individual credit as to who did the writing and who did the illustrations.[2]\\r\\nA feature film adaptation of the series was released by Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies on February 14, 2008. Directed by Mark Waters, it starred Freddie Highmore, Sarah Bolger, Martin Short, Nick Nolte, and Seth Rogen. It followed the basic overall plot of the five novels in the Spiderwick Chronicles series, but left out the majority of the plot from the fourth book and contained several major differences.","input":"Who is the author of the spiderwick chronicles?"},{"output":"1.6 litre","context":"Since its inception in 1947, Formula One has used a variety of engine regulations. \\"Formulas\\" limiting engine capacity had been used in Grand Prix racing on a regular basis since after World War I. The engine formulae are divided according to era.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFormula One currently uses 1.6 litre four-stroke turbocharged 90 degree V6 reciprocating engines.[1]\\r\\nThe power a Formula One engine produces is generated by operating at a very high rotational speed, up to 15,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).[2] This contrasts with road car engines of a similar size which typically operate at less than 6,000 rpm. The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Cosworth DFV and the mean effective pressure had stayed at around 14 bar MEP.[3] Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal valve springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves to the point where the loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault,[4][5] which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have extremely high spring rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers used pneumatic valve springs with the pressurised air allowing engines to reach speeds of over 20,000?rpm.[5][6][7]\\r\\nFormula One cars use short stroke engines. These engines are common in racing motorcycles and streetbikes.[8] The bore is the diameter of the cylinder in the engine block, and the stroke is the distance the piston travels from top dead-centre (TDC) to bottom dead-centre (BDC) inside the cylinder. To operate at high engine speeds the stroke must be relatively short to prevent catastrophic failure; this is usually connecting rod failure as the rod is under very large stresses at these speeds. Having a short stroke means that a relatively large bore is required to make the 1.6 litre engine displacement. This results in a less efficient combustion stroke, especially at lower rpm.[citation needed] The stroke of a Formula One engine is approximately 39.7?mm (1.56?in), less than half the bore diameter 98.0?mm (3.86?in), what is known as an over-square configuration.\\r\\nIn addition to the use of pneumatic valve springs a Formula One engine's high rpm output has been made possible due to advances in metallurgy and design allowing lighter pistons and connecting rods to withstand the accelerations necessary to attain such high speeds, also by narrowing the connecting rod ends allowing for narrower main bearings. This allows for higher rpm with less bearing-damaging heat build-up. For each stroke, the piston goes from a null speed, to almost two times the mean speed, (approximately 40?m/s) then back to zero. This occurs once for each of the four strokes in the cycle: one Intake (down), one Compression (up), one Power (ignition-down), one Exhaust (up). Maximum piston acceleration occurs at top dead center and is in the region of 95,000?m/s2, about 10,000 times standard gravity or 10,000?g.\\r\\nFormula One engines have come through a variety of regulations, manufacturers and configurations through the years.[9]\\r\\nThis era used pre-war voiturette engine regulations, with 4.5?L atmospheric and 1.5?L supercharged engines. The Indianapolis 500 (which was a round of the World Drivers' Championship from 1950 onwards) used pre-war Grand Prix regulations, with 4.5?L atmospheric and 3.0?L supercharged engines. The power range was up to 425?hp (317?kW), though the BRM Type 15 of 1953 reportedly achieved 600?hp (447?kW) with a 1.5?L supercharged engine.\\r\\nIn 1952 and 1953, the World Drivers' Championship was run to Formula 2 regulations, but the existing Formula One regulations remained in force and a number of Formula One races were still held in those years.\\r\\nEngine size was reduced to 2.5?L. for naturally-aspirated and 750?cc supercharged cars were allowed but no constructor built one for the World Championship. The Indianapolis 500 continued to use old pre-war regulations. The power range was up to 290?hp (216?kW).\\r\\nIntroduced in 1961 amidst some criticism, the new reduced engine 1.5?L formula took control of F1 just as every team and manufacturer switched from front to mid-engined cars. Although these were initially underpowered, five years later average power had increased by nearly 50% and lap times were better than in 1960. The old 2.5?L formula had been retained for International Formula racing, but this didn't achieve much success until the introduction of the Tasman Series in Australia and New Zealand during the winter season, leaving the 1.5?L cars as the fastest single seaters in Europe during this time. The power range was between 150?hp (112?kW) and 225?hp (168?kW).\\r\\nIn 1966, with sports cars capable of outrunning Formula 1 cars thanks to much larger and more powerful engines, the FIA increased engine capacity to 3.0?L atmospheric and 1.5 L compressed engines. Although a few manufacturers had been clamouring for bigger engines, the transition wasn't smooth and 1966 was a transitional year, with 2.0 L versions of the BRM and Coventry-Climax V8 engines being used by several entrants. The appearance of the standard-produced Cosworth DFV in 1967 made it possible for small manufacturers to join the series with a chassis designed in-house. Compression devices were allowed for the first time since 1960, but it wasn't until 1977 that a company actually had the finance and interest of building one, when Renault debuted their new Gordini V6 Turbo at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone that year. In 1980 Renault proved that turbocharging was the way to go in order to stay competitive in Formula One (particularly at high-altitude circuits like Kyalami in South Africa and Interlagos in Brazil); this engine had a considerable power advantage against the Ford-Cosworth DFV, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo naturally aspirated engines. Following this, Ferrari introduced their all-new turbocharged engine in 1981. Following these developments, Brabham owner Bernie Ecclestone managed to get BMW to make the team turbocharged inline-4 engines from 1982 onwards. And in 1983, Alfa Romeo made a turbocharged V8 engine, and in the same year and following years, Honda, Porsche (badged as TAG), Ford-Cosworth and other smaller companies made turbo-charged engines, mostly twin-turbocharged V6's. By the midpoint of 1985, every competing team had a turbocharged engine in their car. By 1986, power figures were reaching unprecedented levels, with all engines reaching over 1,000?hp during qualifying with unrestricted turbo boost pressures; This was especially seen with the BMW engines of Benetton's cars, reaching around 1,350?hp at a 5.5 bar boost pressure during qualifying. However, these engines & gearboxes were very unreliable because of the engine's immense power, and would only last about four laps. For the race, the turbocharger's boost was restricted to ensure engine reliability; But, the engines still produced 850 - 1000?hp during the race. The power range from 1966 to 1986 was between 285?hp (210?kW) to 500?hp (370?kW), turbos 500?hp (370?kW) to 900?hp (670?kW) in race, in qualifying up to 1,350?hp (1,010?kW). Following their experiences at Indianapolis, in 1971 Lotus made a few unsuccessful experiments with a Pratt & Whitney turbine fitted to chassis which had also 4WD.\\r\\nFollowing the turbo domination, forced induction was allowed for two seasons before its eventual ban. The FIA regulations limited boost pressure, to 4 bar in qualifying in 1987 for 1.5?L turbo; and allowed a bigger 3.5?L formula. These seasons were still dominated by turbocharged engines, the Honda RA167E V6 supplying Nelson Piquet winning the 1987 Formula One season on a Williams also winning the constructors championship, followed by TAG-Porsche P01 V6 in McLaren then Honda again with the previous RA166E for Lotus then Ferrari's own 033D V6.\\r\\nThe rest of the grid was powered by the Ford GBA V6 turbo with Benetton, then the only naturally aspirated engine, the DFV-derived Ford Cosworth DFZ 3.5?L V8 outputting 575?hp (429?kW) in Tyrrell, Lola, AGS, March and Coloni.[10] The BMW M12/13 inline four was found in Brabhams BT55 tilted almost horizontally, and in upright position under the Megatron brand in Arrows and Ligier, producing 900?bhp (670?kW) at 3.8 bar in race.[11] Zakspeed was building its own turbo inline four, Alfa Romeo was to power the Ligiers with an inline four but the deal fell through after initial testing had been carried out. Alfa was still represented by its old 890T V8 used by Osella, and Minardi was powered by a Motori Moderni V6.\\r\\nThe 1988 Formula One season was again dominated by turbocharged engines limited to 2.5 bar and Honda with its RA168E turbo V6 producing 640?hp (477?kW) at 12500 rpm in qualifying, this time with McLaren drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost winning all the grands prix except one won by Ferrari with its 033E V6 with about 650?hp (485?kW) at 12800 rpm in qualifying. Just behind, Ford introduced its DFR 3.5?L V8 producing 620?hp (462?kW) at 11000 rpm for Benetton, and the 640?hp (477?kW) Megatron BMW M12/13 was still powering Arrows ahead of the Lotus-Honda. Judd introduced its 600?hp (447?kW) CV 3.5?L V8 for March, Williams and Ligier, and the rest of the grid was mainly using previous year's Ford 590?hp (440?kW) Cosworth DFZ except Zakspeed with their own 640?hp (477?kW) engine and the 700?hp (522?kW) Alfa-Romeo V8 turbo for Osella.\\r\\nTurbochargers were banned from the 1989 Formula One season, leaving only a naturally aspirated 3.5?L formula. Honda was still dominant with their RA109E 72 V10 giving 675?hp (503?kW) at 13000 rpm on McLaren cars, enabling Prost to win the championship in front of his teammate Senna. Behind were the Renault RS01 powered Williams, a 67 V10 giving 650?hp (485?kW) at 14300 rpm. Ferrari with its 035/5 65 V12 giving 660?hp (492?kW) at 13,000 rpm. Behind, the grid was powered mainly by Ford Cosworth DFR V8 giving 620?hp (462?kW) at 10,750 rpm except for a few Judd CV V8 in Lotus, Brabham and EuroBrun cars, and two oddballs: the 620?hp (460?kW) Lamborghini 3512 80 V12 powering Lola, and the 560?hp (420?kW) Yamaha OX88 75 V8 in Zakspeed cars. Ford started to try its new design, the 75 V8 HBA 1 with Benetton.\\r\\nThe 1990 Formula One season was again dominated by Honda in McLarens with the 690?hp (515?kW) at 13000 rpm RA100E powering Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger ahead of the 680?hp (507?kW) at 12750 rpm Ferrari Tipo 036 of Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell. Behind them the Ford HBA4 for Benetton and Renault RS2 for Williams with 660?hp (492?kW) at 12,800 rpm were leading the pack powered by Ford DFR and Judd CV engines. The exceptions were the better Lamborghini 3512 in Lola and Lotus, and the new Judd EV 76 V8 giving 640?hp (477?kW) at 12,500 rpm in Leyton House and Brabham cars. The two new contenders were the Life which built for themselves an F35 W12 with three four cylinders banks at 60, and Subaru giving Coloni a 1235 flat 12 from Motori Moderni\\r\\nHonda was still leading the 1991 Formula One season in Senna's McLaren with a 710?hp (529?kW) at 13,000 rpm 60 V12 RA121E, just ahead of the Renault RS3 powered Williams benefiting from 700?hp (520?kW) at 12,500 rpm. Ferrari was behind with its Tipo 037, a new 65 V12 giving 710?hp (529?kW) at 13,800 rpm also powering Minardi, just ahead the Ford HBA4/5/6 in Benetton and Jordan cars. Behind, Tyrrell was using the previous Honda RA109E, Judd introduced its new GV with Dallara leaving the previous EV to Lotus, Yamaha were giving its 660?hp (492?kW) OX99 70 V12 to Brabham, Lamborghini engines were used by Modena and Ligier. Ilmor introduced its LH10, a 680?hp (507?kW) at 13000 rpm V10 which eventually became the Mercedes with Leyton House and Porsche sourced a little successful 3512 V12 to Footwork Arrows; the rest of the field was Ford DFR powered.\\r\\nBy the end of the 1994 season, Ferrari's 043 was putting out 820?hp (611?kW) at 15,800 rpm.[12]\\r\\nThis era used a 3.0?L formula, with a power range between 650?hp (485?kW) and 950?hp (708?kW). Renault was the dominant engine supplier between 1991 and 1997, winning five world championships with Williams and Benetton. From 1998 to 2000 it was Mercedes power that ruled giving Mika H?kkinen two world championships. Ferrari gradually got better with their engine. For 1996, they changed from their traditional V12 engine to a smaller and lighter V10 engine. They preferred reliability to power, losing out to Mercedes in terms of outright power initially. At the 1998 Japanese GP, Ferrari's 047D engine spec was said to produce over 800?bhp (600?kW). From 2000 they were never short of power or reliability.\\r\\nBMW started supplying their engines to Williams from 2000. In the first season, the engine was very reliable though slightly short of power compared to Ferrari and Mercedes units. BMW went straight forward with its engine development. The P81, used during the 2001 season, was able to hit 17,810 rpm. Unfortunately reliability was a big issue with several blowups during the season.\\r\\nThe BMW P82, the engine used by the BMW WilliamsF1 Team in 2002, had hit a peak speed of 19,050 revolutions a minute in its final evolutionary stage. It was also the first engine in the 3.0 litre V10-era to break through the 19,000 rpm-wall, during the 2002 Italian Grand Prix's qualifying.[13] BMW's P83 engine used in 2003 season managed an impressive 19,200 rpm and cleared the 900?bhp (670?kW) mark and weighs less than 200?lb (91?kg).[14]\\r\\nIn 2005, the 3.0?L V10 engine was permitted no more than 5 valves per cylinder.[15] Also, the FIA introduced new regulations limiting each car to one engine per two Grand Prix weekends, putting the emphasis on increased reliability and decreased power output. BMW and Mercedes engines had about 930?bhp (690?kW) in this season. Renault, Honda, Toyota and Ferrari had about 900?bhp (670?kW).\\r\\nFor 2006, the engines had to be 90 V8 of 2.4 litres maximum capacity with a 98?mm (3.9?in) maximum circular bore,[clarification needed] which implies a 39.8?mm (1.57?in) stroke at maximum bore. They had to have two circular inlet and exhaust valves per cylinder,[clarification needed] be normally aspirated and have a 95?kg (209?lb) minimum weight. The previous year's engines with a rev-limiter were permitted for 2006 and 2007 for teams who were unable to acquire a V8 engine, with Scuderia Toro Rosso using a Cosworth V10, after Red Bull's takeover of the former Minardi team did not include the new engines.[16]\\r\\nPre-cooling air before it enters the cylinders, injection of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, variable-geometry intake and exhaust systems, and variable valve timing were forbidden. Each cylinder could have only one fuel injector and a single plug spark ignition. Separate starting devices were used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. The crankcase and cylinder block had to be made of cast or wrought aluminium alloys. The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.[17]\\r\\nThe reduction in capacity was designed to give a power reduction of around 20% from the three litre engines, to reduce the increasing speeds of Formula One cars. Despite this, in many cases, performance of the car improved. In 2006 Toyota F1 announced an approximate 740?hp (552?kW) output at 18000 rpm for its new RVX-06 engine,[18] but real figures are of course difficult to obtain.\\r\\nThe engine specification was frozen in 2007 to keep development costs down. The engines which were used in the 2006 Japanese Grand Prix were used for the 2007 and 2008 seasons and they were limited to 19,000 rpm. In 2009 the limit was reduced to 18,000 rpm with each driver allowed to use a maximum of 8 engines over the season. Any driver needing an additional engine is penalised 10 places on the starting grid for the first race the engine is used. This increases the importance of reliability, although the effect is only seen towards the end of the season. Certain design changes intended to improve engine reliability may be carried out with permission from the FIA. This has led to some engine manufacturers, notably Ferrari and Mercedes, exploiting this ability by making design changes which not only improve reliability, but also boost engine power output as a side effect. As the Mercedes engine was proven to be the strongest, re-equalisations of engines were allowed by the FIA to allow other manufacturers to match the power.[19]\\r\\n2009 saw the exit of Honda from Formula 1. The team was acquired by Ross Brawn, creating Brawn GP and the BGP 001. With the absence of the Honda engine, Brawn GP retrofitted the Mercedes engine to the BGP 001 chassis. The newly branded team won both the Constructors' Championship and the Drivers' Championship from better-known and better-established contenders Ferrari, McLaren-Mercedes, and Renault.\\r\\nCosworth, absent since the 2006 season, returned in 2010. New teams Lotus Racing, HRT, and Virgin Racing, along with the established Williams, used this engine. The season also saw the withdrawal of the BMW and Toyota engines, as the car companies withdrew from Formula One due to the recession.[20]\\r\\nIn 2009, constructors were allowed to use kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS), also called regenerative brakes. Energy can either be stored as mechanical energy (as in a flywheel) or as electrical energy (as in a battery or supercapacitor), with a maximum power of 81?hp (60?kW; 82 PS). Four teams used it at some point in the season: Ferrari, Renault, BMW, and McLaren.\\r\\nAlthough KERS was still legal in F1 in the 2010 season, all the teams agreed not to use it. KERS returned for the 2011 season, when only three teams elected not to use it. For the 2012 season, only Marussia and HRT raced without KERS, and in 2013 all teams on the grid had KERS. From 2010 to 2013 cars have a regular power of 700-800?hp.\\r\\nThe FIA announced the intention to change the 2.4-litre V8 engines to 1.6 litre V6 turbo engines for the 2014 season. The new regulations include multiple energy recovery systems [21] and fuel flow restrictions, to attract more commercial partners.\\r\\nThe new formula reintroduced turbocharged engines, which last appeared in 1988. These have their efficiency improved by turbo-compounding and introduce more energy recovery systems ÿ with power to be harvested from the brakes and exhaust gases.[22] The original proposal for four-cylinder turbocharged engines was not welcomed by the racing teams, in particular Ferrari. Adrian Newey stated during the 2011 European Grand Prix that the change to a V6 enables teams to carry the engine as a stressed member, whereas an inline 4 would have required a space frame. A compromise was reached to adopt V6 turbocharged engines instead.[22] The internal combustion engines are limited to 15,000 rpm, but rarely exceed 12,000 rpm during Grand Prix due to the new reliability and fuel flow restrictions.[23]\\r\\nEnergy recovery systems were allowed to have a maximum power of 120?kW (160?bhp) and 2 megajoules per lap.

In addition, he was the first European to find Kilimanjaro.[1] News of Rebmann's discovery was published in the Church Missionary Intelligencer in May 1849, but disregarded as mere fantasy for the next twelve years. The Geographical Society of London held that snow could not possibly occur let alone persist in such latitudes and considered the report to be the hallucination of a malaria-stricken missionary.[2] It was only in 1861 that researchers began their efforts to measure Kilimanjaro. Expeditions to Tanzania between 1861 and 1865, led by the German Baron Karl Klaus von der Decken, confirmed Rebmanns report. Together with his colleague Johann Ludwig Krapf he also discovered Mt. Kenya.[3] Their work there is also thought to have had effects on future African expeditions by Europeans, including the exploits of Sir Richard Burton, John Hanning Speke, and David Livingstone.[4] After losing most of his eyesight and entering into a brief marriage, he died of pneumonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nRebmann was born to a Swabian farmer and winegrower on January 16, 1820 in Gerlingen, Wrttemberg. The village he lived in was very small, with about 1,500 inhabitants. Even at an early age, he aspired to be a \\"preacher and canvasser of the gospel\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, when Rebmann became a young man, he chose to devote himself to being a missionary, and was trained in Basel.[6][7] In 1844 he attended the Church Missionary Society College, Islington. The following year he was ordained as a priest by the Bishop of London and he became a member of the Church Missionary Society.[5][8] Together with fellow missionary Johann Ludwig Krapf, Rebmann traveled in 1846 by a ship called \\"Arrow\\" to East Africa, where he worked in what is now Kenya, as well as at various other locations.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir work was hard, and they had much trouble convincing tribal chiefs to let them speak to the people. Krapf noted (what he called) the \\"surge of Islam\\" that was going through Africa, and wanted to make some sort of Christian standing against its religious influence on the people of the continent. As the radius of the two missionaries' work expanded, plans for Christian missionary outposts in the area began to develop.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his time in Africa, Rebmann kept a diary from 1848 until the end of his life. In the diary, Rebmann writes of the way his trust in his Christianity kept him stable in the continent of Africa, where only very few Europeans had ventured before him. An extract from the diary, which Rebmann in turn took from the Bible (Psalm: 51, 12) reflects Rebmann's belief in his faith: \\"Restore to me joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1848, Rebmann was the first European to see Mount Kilimanjaro. The following year, he saw Mount Kenya together with his colleague Krapf.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the October 16, 1847, the two men set out for the interior of Kenya. With them came eight tribesmen and a local caravan leader named Bwana Kheri. This expedition was designed with the goal of establishing some of the first mission posts in the region. The journey was successful, and the group of tribesmen and the missionaries returned to Mombasa on October 27.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSometime during their journey or their stay in the region, Rebmann and Krapf learned of a great mountain referred to as 'Kilimansharo', which reached the clouds and which was 'capped in silver'. The two men, like most Europeans at the time, were under the impression that snow and ice could not exist so close to the equator, and failed to realize the significance of the mountain being 'topped with silver'.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the two missionaries, who had become just as much explorers as they were missionaries, became quite interested in Kilimanjaro, and Krapf sought permission of the Mombasa governor for an expedition to the land of the Jagga, a people now known as the Chaga, who lived and live on the actual slopes of Kilimanjaro. Krapf told the governor that this journey would be work-based. Despite this, Krapf actually did not accompany Rebmann on the journey, so only Bwana Kheri and Rebmann left for Kilimanjaro on April 27, 1848.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin two weeks, Rebmann and his guide were within sight of the mountain. He noted in his journal the strange white on the summit of Kilimanjaro, and he questioned his guide on what he thought it was. According to Rebmann's log, the guide 'did not know what it was, but supposed it was coldness'. It was then that Rebmann realised that Kilimanjaro was in fact capped in snow.[11] In 1849, these observations were published, but the findings were not truly accepted by most of the scientific community at the time.[11] On November 10, 1848, Rebmann recorded an entry in his log about the mountain:[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis morning we discerned the Mountains of Jagga more distinctly than ever; and about ten o'clock I fancied I saw a dazzlingly white cloud. My Guide called the white which I saw merely 'Baridi,' cold; it was perfectly clear to me, however, that it could be nothing else but snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nMt. Kenya was discovered by Krapf in the next year, on December 3, 1849. The finding of this mountain was also met with disbelief in Europe, but the effect of these discoveries was enough to trigger further investigation into other areas of Africa, thereby stimulating a growth of scientific (among other fields) knowledge of the regions, people, history, and geography of the African continent.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nRebmann stayed in Africa for almost thirty consecutive years. He kept to a policy that, in order to truly affect the African people, and to complete his task as a missionary, much patience was needed. It appears that this policy was the driving force behind his many years of work on the continent.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as visiting Kilimanjaro, Rebmann and Krapf visited other areas of Africa, including the African Great Lakes and Mount Meru.[11] He even became married to a fellow missionary, Anna Maria, ne Maisch, with whom he spent fifteen years doing missionary work in Africa before her death in 1866, and with whom he had a child (who died only days after his birth).[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso during his time in Africa, after his expeditions to Kilimanjaro and around the Great lakes, he learned to speak several native languages, and completed a dictionary (started by his colleague Ludwig Krapf) of the Nika (Mijikenda) language,[13] and a dictionary of Swahili (now lost, but of which some material may have been incorporated into Krapf's Dictionary of the Suaheli Language (1882)).[14] He also translated the Gospel of Luke into Swahili.[15] In addition, after meeting a Swahili-speaking slave known as Salimini, originally from Malawi, in 1853, he compiled the first ever Chichewa language dictionary, which was eventually published in 1877.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring their time in Africa, Krapf and Rebmann worked their way into the interior of the continent. They traveled to several areas in the regions of Central and Eastern Africa, including to what is now known as the African Great Lakes. The finding of one especially large lake (Uniamsi) is depicted in a map known as the 'Slug' map. It was known by this name because the layout of the water body suggested a shape similar to that of a slug.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basis for the map was prepared by the missionary Jakob Erhardt from the reports of his companions Krapf and Rebmann, and from verbal information that he had acquired from local people. Erhardt was struck by the fact that travelers who had gone inland from different points on the coast had all come to an inland sea. In November 1854, while talking about the problem to Rebmann, \\"at one and the same moment, the problem flashed on both of us solved by the simple supposition that where geographical hypothesis had hitherto supposed an enormous mountain-land, we must now look for an enormous valley and an inland sea.\\"[17]\\r\\nOn the map that he and Rebmann drew, the three lakes of Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa are shown as one very large L-shaped lake.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the map, several subtle but interesting things can be discovered, including, in the northeast section of the cartograph, a reference to a stream flowing into Lake Victoria, then known by the missionaries as \\"the Ukerewa\\". A note describes how the waters of the stream were very sweet, but stained the teeth a sickly yellow. This note is probably the first known text referring to the drinking water, found primarily around Mount Meru, which has a high content of fluorine and causes a yellow-brown stain to the incisors which cannot be removed.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother piece of writing on the Slug Map ÿ \\"From where the Magad [soda] is bought\\" ÿ provides evidence that the trade in soda originating in Lake Natron (obviously not known by that name then) was already active at that time.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1855 Erhardt was repatriated due to poor health, and took his map with him. It was first published in the Calwer Missionsblatt in 1855, and then in the Church Missionary intelligencer in 1856.[19]\\r\\nThe map is now in the care of the Royal Geographical Society in London. It is described by the Society as:[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSketch of a Map from 1N. to 15S. Latitude and from 23 to 43E. Longitude delineating the probably position and extent of the Sea of Uniamesi as being the continuation of the Lake Niasa and exhibiting the numerous heathen-tribes situated to the East and West of that great Inland-sea together with the Caravan routes leading to it and into the interior in general.

Society in East Africa Kisaludini March 14, 1855.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving almost lost his eyesight for unknown reasons, Rebmann went back to Europe in September 1875.[20][21] He returned to Germany for the first time in 29 years after being persuaded to do so by a fellow missionary who was working in the area. He then proceeded to take up residence in Korntal near Stuttgart, where he was close to his old friend Krapf. In spring 1876, upon the advice of Krapf, he married  the widow of another missionary from India, Louise Rebmann ne D?uble.[10][20] The marriage did not last long, as on October 4, 1876, Rebmann died of pneumonia.[4][20] Engraved on Rebmann's tombstone in the cemetery of Korntal are the words (in English) \\"Saved in the arms of Jesus\\" (a photo can be seen here).[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legacy that he left behind him is preserved by the Johannes Rebmann Foundation, a religious society devoted to Rebmann and his memory. Rebmann's work in Africa, both as a missionary and as an explorer, allowed other Europeans to follow in his footsteps.[6][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral:\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecific:","input":"Who was the first european to see mount kilimanjaro?"},{"output":"Rob Cantor","context":"Shia LaBeouf is a comedy song by Rob Cantor about Shia LaBeouf.

The 264-square-kilometre (102-square-mile) territory comprises the three islands of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman located south of Cuba, northeast of Costa Rica, north of Panama, east of Mexico and northwest of Jamaica. Its population is approximately 60,765,[7] and its capital is George Town.\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands is considered to be part of the geographic Western Caribbean Zone as well as the Greater Antilles. The territory is often considered a major world offshore financial haven for international businesses and many wealthy individuals.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands remained largely uninhabited until the 17th century. While there is no archaeological evidence for an indigenous people on the islands, a variety of settlers from various backgrounds made their home on the islands, including pirates, shipwrecked sailors, and deserters from Oliver Cromwell's army in Jamaica.[9]\\r\\nThe first recorded permanent inhabitant of the Cayman Islands, Isaac Bodden, was born on Grand Cayman around 1661. He was the grandson of the original settler named Bodden who was probably one of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers at the taking of Jamaica in 1655.[10]\\r\\nEngland took formal control of the Cayman Islands, along with Jamaica, as a result of the Treaty of Madrid of 1670. Following several unsuccessful attempts at settlement, a permanent English-speaking population in the islands dates from the 1730s. With settlement, after the first royal land grant by the Governor of Jamaica in 1734, came the perceived need for slaves.[11] Many were brought to the islands from Africa; this is evident today with the majority of native Caymanians being of African and English descent. The results of the first census taken in the islands in 1802 showed the population on Grand Cayman to be 933 with 545 of those inhabitants being enslaved. Slavery was abolished in the Cayman Islands in 1833. At the time of abolition, there were over 950 Blacks of African ancestry enslaved by 116 white families of English ancestry.[12]\\r\\nThe islands continued to be governed as part of the Colony of Jamaica until 1962, when they became a separate Crown colony while Jamaica became an independent Commonwealth realm.[13]\\r\\nOn 8 February 1794, the Caymanians rescued the crews of a group of ten merchant ships, including HMS Convert, an incident that has since become known as the Wreck of the Ten Sail. The ships had struck a reef and run aground during rough seas.[14] Legend has it that King George III rewarded the island with a promise never to introduce taxes as compensation for their generosity, as one of the ships carried a member of the King's own family. While this remains a popular legend, the story is not true.[15]\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands historically has been a tax-exempt destination. The government of the Cayman Islands has always relied on indirect and not direct taxes. The territory has never levied income tax, capital gains tax, or any wealth tax, making them a popular tax haven.[16]\\r\\nOn 11 September 2004 the island of Grand Cayman, which lies largely unprotected at sea level, was hit by Hurricane Ivan, creating an 8-ft (2.4?m) storm surge which flooded many areas of Grand Cayman. An estimated 83% of the dwellings on the island were damaged including 4% requiring complete reconstruction. A reported 70% of all dwellings suffered severe damage from flooding or wind. Another 26% sustained minor damage from partial roof removal, low levels of flooding, or impact with floating or wind driven hurricane debris.[17] Power, water and communications were disrupted for months in some areas as Ivan was the worst hurricane to hit the islands in 86 years.[18] Grand Cayman began a major rebuilding process and within two years its infrastructure was nearly returned to pre-hurricane status. Due to the tropical location of the islands, more hurricanes or tropical systems have affected the Cayman Islands than any other region in the Atlantic basin; it has been brushed or directly hit, on average, every 2.23 years.[19]\\r\\nThe islands are in the western Caribbean Sea and are the peaks of a massive underwater ridge, known as the Cayman Ridge (or Cayman Rise). This ridge flanks the Cayman Trough, 6,000?m (20,000?ft) deep[20] which lies 6?km (3.7?mi) to the south.[21] The islands lie in the northwest of the Caribbean Sea, east of Quintana Roo, Mexico and Yucatn State, Mexico, northeast of Costa Rica, north of Panama, south of Cuba and west of Jamaica. They are situated about 700?km (430?mi) south of Miami,[22] 750?km (470?mi) east of Mexico,[23] 366?km (227?mi) south of Cuba,[24] and about 500?km (310?mi) northwest of Jamaica.[25] Grand Cayman is by far the largest, with an area of 197?km2 (76?sq?mi).[26] Grand Cayman's two \\"sister islands\\", Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, are about 120?km (75?mi) east north-east of Grand Cayman and have areas of 38 and 28.5?km2 (14.7 and 11.0?sq?mi)[27] respectively.\\r\\nAll three islands were formed by large coral heads covering submerged ice age peaks of western extensions of the Cuban Sierra Maestra range and are mostly flat. One notable exception to this is The Bluff on Cayman Brac's eastern part, which rises to 43?m (141?ft) above sea level, the highest point on the islands.[28]\\r\\nTerrain is mostly a low-lying limestone base surrounded by coral reefs.\\r\\nThe mammalian species in the Cayman Islands include the introduced Central American agouti[29] and eight species of bats. At least three now extinct native rodent species were present up until the discovery of the islands by Europeans. A number of cetaceans are found in offshore waters. Among these species are the Goose-beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris) and Sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus).\\r\\nCayman avian fauna includes two endemic subspecies of Amazona parrots: Amazona leucocephala hesterna or Cuban amazon, presently restricted to the island of Cayman Brac, but formerly also on Little Cayman, and Amazona leucocephala caymanensis or Grand Cayman parrot, which is native to the Cayman Islands, forested areas of Cuba, and the Isla de la Juventud. Little Cayman and Cayman Brac are also home to red-footed and brown boobies.[30][31] There are five endemic subspecies of butterflies on the islands.[32] These butterfly breeds can be viewed at the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on the Grand Cayman.\\r\\nAmong other notable fauna at the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park is the critically endangered blue iguana which is also known as the Grand Cayman iguana (Cyclura lewisi). The blue iguana is endemic to the Grand Cayman[33] particularly because of rocky, sunlit, open areas near the island's shores that are advantageous for the laying of eggs.\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands has a tropical wet and dry climate, with a wet season from May to October, and a dry season that runs from November to April. Seasonally, there is little temperature change.[34]\\r\\nA major natural hazard is the tropical cyclones that form during the Atlantic hurricane season from June to November.\\r\\nOn 11 and 12 September 2004, Hurricane Ivan struck the Cayman Islands. The storm resulted in two deaths and caused great damage to the infrastructure on the islands. The total economic impact of the storms was estimated to be $3.4 billion.[35]\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands have more registered businesses than people.[36] In 2016 the Cayman Islands had an estimated population of about 60,765,[7] representing a mix of more than 100 nationalities. Out of that number, about half are of Caymanian descent. About 60% of the population is of mixed race (mostly mixed African-Caucasian). The islands are almost exclusively Christian, with large numbers of Baptists, Presbyterians and Catholics, but also hosts Jewish,[37] Muslim and Hindu communities. The vast majority of the population resides on Grand Cayman, followed by Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, respectively.[4] The capital of the Cayman Islands is George Town, on the southwest coast of Grand Cayman.\\r\\nAccording to the Cayman Islands 2016 Compendium of Statistics released by the Economics and Statistics Office (ESO) the estimated resident population is above 61,000 people,[38] broken down as follows:\\r\\nSir Vassel Johnson, who became the only Caymanian ever knighted, was a pioneer of Caymans financial services industry. Cayman Islands Past Governor Stuart Jack said As one of the architects of modern Cayman, especially the financial industry, Sir Vassel guided the steady growth of these Islands as the first financial secretary. His remarkable vision set the foundation for the prosperity and economic stability of these islands. Without his input, Cayman might well have remained the islands that time forgot.[39]\\r\\nWith an average income of around KYD$47,000, Caymanians have the highest standard of living in the Caribbean. According to the CIA World Factbook, the Cayman Islands GDP per capita is the 38th highest in the world, but the CIA's data for Cayman dates to 2004 and is likely to be lower than present-day values.[40] The territory prints its own currency, the Cayman Islands dollar (KYD), which is pegged to the US dollar 1.227 USD to 1 KYD. However, in many retail stores throughout the islands, the KYD is typically traded at 1.25 USD.[41] The government has established a Needs Assessment Unit to relieve poverty in the islands.[42]\\r\\nThe government's primary source of income is indirect taxation: there is no income tax, capital gains tax, or corporation tax.[16] An import duty of 5% to 22% (automobiles 29.5% to 100%) is levied against goods imported into the islands. Few goods are exempt; notable exemptions include books, cameras, and infant formula.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn 15 July 2012 one of the Cayman Islands' former Premiers McKeeva Bush announced the intended introduction of a \\"community enhancement fee\\" in the form of a payroll tax to be paid solely by expatriate workers. Caymanians themselves were to remain exempt from this tax. This would have been the first direct tax on income in the Cayman Islands' history.[43] Bush also announced a five percent fee on \\"certain categories of employment\\" to be payable by businesses. However, the payroll tax was scrapped before it had been implemented.[44]\\r\\nOne of Grand Cayman's main attractions is Seven Mile Beach, site of a number of the island's hotels and resorts. Named one of the Ultimate Beaches by Caribbean Travel and Life, Seven Mile Beach is on the western shore of Grand Cayman Island. It is a public property and possible to walk the full length of the beach, past all the hotels, resorts, and public beach bars.[45] Historical sites in Grand Cayman, such as Pedro St James Castle in Savannah, also attract visitors.[46] Tourists also visit the \\"sister islands\\", Little Cayman[47] and Cayman Brac.[48]\\r\\nAll three islands offer scuba diving, and the Cayman Islands is home to several snorkelling locations where tourists can swim with stingrays. The most popular area to do this is Stingray City, Grand Cayman. Stingray City is a top attraction in Grand Cayman and originally started in the 1980s, when divers started feeding squid to stingrays. The stingrays started to associate the sound of the boat motors with food, and thus visit this area year round.[49]\\r\\nThere are two shipwrecks off the shores of Cayman Brac, including the MV Captain Keith Tibbetts;[50] Grand Cayman also has several shipwrecks off its shores, including one deliberate one. On 30 September 1994 the USS?Kittiwake was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register. In November 2008 her ownership was transferred for an undisclosed amount to the government of the Cayman Islands, which had decided to sink the Kittiwake in June 2009 to form a new artificial reef off Seven Mile Beach, Grand Cayman. Following several delays, the ship was finally scuttled according to plan on 5 January 2011. The Kittiwake has become a dynamic environment for marine life. While visitors are not allowed to take anything, there are endless sights. Each of the five decks of the ship offers squirrelfish, rare sponges, Goliath groupers, urchins, and more. Experienced and beginner divers are invited to swim around the Kittiwake.[51]  Pirates Week, an annual 11-day November festival, was started in 1977 by Jim Bodden, then Minister of Tourism, to boost tourism during the country's tourism slow season.[52]\\r\\nOther Grand Cayman tourist attractions include the Ironshore landscape of Hell, the 23-acre (93,000?m2) marine theme park Boatswain's Beach, also home of the Cayman Turtle Farm, the production of gourmet sea salt, and the Mastic Trail, a hiking trail through the forests in the centre of the island. The National Trust for the Cayman Islands provides guided tours weekly on the Mastic Trail and other locations.[53]\\r\\nAnother attraction to visit on Grand Cayman is the Observation Tower, located in Camana Bay. The Observation Tower is 75 feet tall and provides 360-degree views across Seven Mile Beach, George Town, the North Sound, and beyond. It is free to the public and climbing the tower has become a popular thing to do in the Cayman Islands.[54]\\r\\nPoints of interest include the East End Light (sometimes called Gorling Bluff Light), a lighthouse at the east end of Grand Cayman island. The lighthouse is the centrepiece of East End Lighthouse Park, managed by the National Trust for the Cayman Islands; the first navigational aid on the site was the first lighthouse in the Cayman Islands.\\r\\nThe merchant marine total is 123 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totalling 2,402,058 GRT/3,792,094 metric tons deadweight (DWT). The fleet includes 22 bulk carriers, 5 cargo ships, 31 chemical tankers, 2 container ships, 1 liquefied gas transport, 21 petroleum tankers, 35 refrigerated cargo ships, 5 roll-on/roll-off vessels and 1 specialised tanker. (Note: some foreign ships register in the Cayman Islands as a flag of convenience. In 2002 ships from eleven countries took advantage of this option, including 15 from Greece, 5 from the United States, 5 from the United Kingdom, 2 from Cyprus, 2 from Denmark and 3 from Norway.)\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands is a major international financial centre. The largest sectors are \\"banking, hedge fund formation and investment, structured finance and securitisation, captive insurance, and general corporate activities\\".[55] Regulation and supervision of the financial services industry is the responsibility of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA). Sir Vassel Johnson was a pioneer of Caymans financial services industry.\\r\\nSir Vassel, who became the only Caymanian ever knighted in 1994, served as the Cayman Islands financial secretary from 1965 through 1982 and then as an Executive Council member from 1984 through 1988. In his government roles, Sir Vassel was a driving force in shaping the Cayman Islands financial services industry.[56]\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands is the fifth-largest banking centre in the world,[57] with $1.5 trillion in banking liabilities as of June 2007[update].[55] In March 2017 there were 158 banks, 11 of which were licensed to conduct banking activities with domestic (Cayman-based) and international clients, and the remaining 147 were licensed to operate on an international basis with only limited domestic activity.[58] Financial services generated KYD$1.2 billion of GDP in 2007 (55% of the total economy), 36% of all employment and 40% of all government revenue. In 2010, the country ranked fifth internationally in terms of value of liabilities booked and sixth in terms of assets booked. It has branches of 40 of the world's 50 largest banks. The Cayman Islands is the second largest captive domicile (Bermuda is largest) in the world with more than 700 captives, writing more than US$7.7 billion of premiums and with US$36.8 billion of assets under management.[59]\\r\\nThere are a number of service providers. These include global financial institutions including HSBC, Deutsche Bank, UBS, and Goldman Sachs; over 80 administrators, leading accountancy practices (incl. the Big Four auditors), and offshore law practices including Maples & Calder.[60] They also include wealth management such as Rothschilds private banking and financial advice.[61]\\r\\nSince the introduction of the Mutual Funds Law in 1993, which has been copied by jurisdictions around the world, the Cayman Islands has grown to be the world's leading offshore hedge fund jurisdiction.[60] In June 2008, it passed 10,000 hedge fund registrations, and over the year ending June 2008 CIMA reported a net growth rate of 12% for hedge funds.[62]\\r\\nStarting in the mid-late 1990s, offshore financial centres, such as the Cayman Islands, came under increasing pressure from the OECD for their allegedly harmful tax regimes, where the OECD wished to prevent low-tax regimes from having an advantage in the global marketplace. The OECD threatened to place the Cayman Islands and other financial centres on a \\"black list\\" and impose sanctions against them.[63] However, the Cayman Islands successfully avoided being placed on the OECD black list in 2000 by committing to regulatory reform to improve transparency and begin information exchange with OECD member countries about their citizens.[63]\\r\\nIn 2004, under pressure from the UK, the Cayman Islands agreed in principle to implement the European Union Savings Directive (EUSD), but only after securing some important benefits for the financial services industry in the Cayman Islands. As the Cayman Islands is not subject to EU laws, the implementation of the EUSD is by way of bilateral agreements between each EU member state and the Cayman Islands. The government of the Cayman Islands agreed on a model agreement, which set out how the EUSD would be implemented with the Cayman Islands.[64]\\r\\nA report published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in March 2005, assessing supervision and regulation in the Cayman Islands' banking, insurance and securities industries, as well as its money laundering regime, recognised the jurisdiction's comprehensive regulatory and compliance frameworks. \\"An extensive program of legislative, rule and guideline development has introduced an increasingly effective system of regulation, both formalizing earlier practices and introducing enhanced procedures\\", noted IMF assessors. The report further stated that \\"the supervisory system benefits from a well-developed banking infrastructure with an internationally experienced and qualified workforce as well as experienced lawyers, accountants and auditors\\", adding that, \\"the overall compliance culture within Cayman is very strong, including the compliance culture related to AML (anti-money laundering) obligations\\".[65][66]\\r\\nOn 4 May 2009, the United States President, Barack Obama, declared his intentions to curb the use of financial centres by multinational corporations. In his speech, he singled out the Cayman Islands as a tax shelter.[67] The next day, the Cayman Island Financial Services Association submitted an open letter to the president detailing the Cayman Islands' role in international finance and its value to the US financial system.[68]\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands was ranked as the world's second most significant tax haven on the Tax Justice Network's \\"Financial Secrecy Index\\" from 2011, scoring slightly higher than Luxembourg and falling behind only Switzerland.[69] In 2013, the Cayman Islands was ranked by the Financial Secrecy Index as the fourth safest tax haven in the world, behind Hong Kong but ahead of Singapore. In the first conviction of a non-Swiss financial institution for US tax evasion conspiracy, two Cayman Islands financial institutions pleaded guilty in Manhattan Federal Court in 2016 to conspiring to hide more than $130 million in Cayman Islands bank accounts. The companies admitted to helping US clients hide assets in offshore accounts, and agreed to produce account files of non-compliant US taxpayers.[70]\\r\\nOn 30 June 2014, the tax jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands was deemed to have an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) with the United States of America with respect to the \\"Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act\\" of the United States of America.[71]\\r\\nThe Model 1 Agreement recognizes:[71]\\r\\nOn 26 March 2017, the US Treasury site disclosed that the Model 1 agreement and related agreement were \\"In Force\\" on 1 July 2014.\\r\\nUnder the UK Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2018, beneficial ownership of companies in British overseas territories such as the Cayman Islands must be publicly registered for disclosure by 31 December 2020.[72] The Government of the Cayman Islands plans to challenge this law, arguing that it violates the Constitutional sovereignty granted to the islands.[72]\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands has a small population of 60,765 (as of 2016) and therefore a limited workforce. Work permits may, therefore, be granted to foreigners. On average, there have been more than 21,000 foreigners holding valid work permits.[73]\\r\\nTo work in the Cayman Islands as a non-citizen, a work permit is required. This involves passing a police background check and a health check. A prospective immigrant worker will not be granted a permit unless certain medical conditions are present which include testing negative for syphilis and HIV. A permit may be granted to individuals on special work.\\r\\nA foreigner must first have a job to move to the Cayman Islands. The employer applies and pays for the work permit.[74] Work permits are not granted to foreigners who are in the Cayman Islands (unless it is a renewal). The Cayman Islands Immigration Department requires foreigners to remain out of the country until their work permit has been approved.[75]\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands presently imposes a controversial \\"rollover\\" in relation to expatriate workers who require a work permit. Non-Caymanians are only permitted to reside and work within the territory for a maximum of nine years unless they satisfy the criteria of key employees. Non-Caymanians who are \\"rolled over\\" may return to work additional nine-year periods, subject to a one-year gap between their periods of work. The policy has been the subject of some controversy within the press. Law firms have been particularly upset by the recruitment difficulties that it has caused.[76] Other less well-remunerated employment sectors have been affected as well. Concerns about safety have been expressed by diving instructors, and realtors have also expressed concerns. Others support the rollover as necessary to protect Caymanian identity in the face of immigration of large numbers of expatriate workers.[77]\\r\\nConcerns have been expressed that in the long term, the policy may damage the preeminence of the Cayman Islands as an offshore financial centre by making it difficult to recruit and retain experienced staff from onshore financial centres. Government employees are no longer exempt from this \\"rollover\\" policy, according to this report in a local newspaper.[78] The governor has used his constitutional powers, which give him absolute control over the disposition of civil service employees, to determine which expatriate civil servants are dismissed after seven years service and which are not.[citation needed]\\r\\nThis policy is incorporated in the Immigration Law (2003 revision), written by the United Democratic Party government, and subsequently enforced by the People's Progressive Movement Party government. Both governments agree to the term limits on foreign workers, and the majority of Caymanians also agree it is necessary to protect local culture and heritage from being eroded by a large number of foreigners gaining residency and citizenship.[79]\\r\\nIn recognition of the CARICOM (Free Movement) Skilled Persons Act which came into effect in July 1997 in some of the CARICOM countries such as Jamaica and which has been adopted in other CARICOM countries, such as Trinidad and Tobago[80] it is possible that CARICOM nationals who hold the \\"A Certificate of Recognition of Caribbean Community Skilled Person\\" may be allowed to work in the Cayman Islands[81] under normal working conditions.\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands is a British overseas territory, listed by the UN Special Committee of 24 as one of the 16 non-self-governing territories. The current Constitution, incorporating a Bill of Rights, was ordained by a statutory instrument of the United Kingdom in 2009.[82] A 19-seat (not including two non-voting members appointed by the Governor which brings the total to 21 members) Legislative Assembly is elected by the people every four years to handle domestic affairs.[83] Of the elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), seven are chosen to serve as government Ministers in a Cabinet headed by the Governor. The Premier is appointed by the Governor.[84]\\r\\nA Governor is appointed by the Queen of the United Kingdom on the advice of the British Government to represent the monarch.[85] Governors can exercise complete legislative and executive authority if they wish through blanket powers reserved to them in the constitution.[86] Bills which have passed the Legislative Assembly require royal assent before becoming effective. The Constitution empowers the Governor to withhold royal assent in cases where the legislation appears to him or her to be repugnant to or inconsistent with the Constitution or affects the rights and privileges of the Legislative Assembly or the Royal Prerogative, or matters reserved to the Governor by article 55.[87] The executive authority of the Cayman Islands is vested in the Queen and is exercised by the Government, consisting of the Governor and the Cabinet.[88] There is an office of the Deputy Governor, who must be a Caymanian and have served in a senior public office. The Deputy Governor is the acting Governor when the office of Governor is vacant, or the Governor is not able to discharge his or her duties or is absent from the Cayman Islands.[89] The current Governor of the Cayman Islands is Anwar Choudhury[90][91].\\r\\nThe Cabinet is composed of two official members and seven elected members, called Ministers; one of whom is designated Premier. The Premier can serve for two consecutive terms after which he is barred from attaining the office again. Although an MLA can only be Premier twice any person who meets the qualifications and requirements for a seat in the Legislative Assembly can be elected to the Legislative Assembly indefinitely.[92]\\r\\nThere are two official members of the Legislative Assembly, the Deputy Governor and the Attorney General. They are appointed by the Governor in accordance with Her Majesty's instructions, and although they have seats in the Legislative Assembly, under the 2009 Constitution, they do not vote. They serve in a professional and advisory role to the MLAs, the Deputy Governor represents the Governor who is a representative of the Queen and the British Government. While the Attorney General serves to advise on legal matters and has special responsibilities in the LA, he is generally responsible for changes to the Penal code among other things.\\r\\nThe seven Ministers are voted into office by the 19 elected members of the Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands. One of the Ministers, the leader of the majority political party, is appointed Premier by the Governor.\\r\\nAfter consulting the Premier, the Governor allocates a portfolio of responsibilities to each Cabinet Minister. Under the principle of collective responsibility, all Ministers are obliged to support in the Assembly any measures approved by Cabinet.\\r\\nAlmost 80 departments, sections and units carry out the business of government, joined by a number of statutory boards and authorities set up for specific purposes, such as the Port Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Immigration Board, the Water Authority, the University College Board of Governors, the National Pensions Board and the Health Insurance Commission.\\r\\nSince 2000, there have been two official major political parties: The Cayman Democratic Party (CDP) and the People's Progressive Movement (PPM). While there has been a shift to political parties, many contending for office still run as independents. The two parties are notably similar, though they consider each other rivals in most cases, their differences are generally in personality and implementation rather than actual policy. The Cayman Islands currently lacks any real liberal or progressive representation in the Legislative Assembly or in the form of organized political parties.\\r\\nThe defence of the Cayman Islands is the responsibility of the United Kingdom. Law enforcement in the country is provided chiefly by the Royal Cayman Islands Police Service and the Cayman Islands Customs Department. These two agencies co-operate in aspects of law enforcement, including their joint marine unit. The Cayman Islands Cadet Corps was formed in March 2001 and carries out military-type training with teenage citizens of the country. As of 2017 the PPM led Coalition government have pledged to form a Coast Guard to protect the interests of the Islands, especially in terms of illegal immigration and illegal drug importation.\\r\\nNo direct taxation is imposed on residents and Cayman Islands companies. The government receives the majority of its income from indirect taxation. Duty is levied against most imported goods, which is typically in the range of 22% to 25%. Some items are exempted, such as baby formula, books, cameras and certain items are taxed at 5%. Duty on automobiles depends on their value. The duty can amount to 29.5% up to $20,000.00 KYD CIF (cost, insurance and freight) and up to 42% over $30,000.00 KYD CIF for expensive models. The government charges flat licensing fees on financial institutions that operate in the islands and there are work permit fees on foreign labour. A 13% government tax is placed on all tourist accommodations in addition to US$37.50 airport departure tax which is built into the cost of an airline ticket. There are no taxes on corporate profits, capital gains, or personal income. There are no estate or death inheritance taxes payable on Cayman Islands real estate or other assets held in the Cayman Islands.[93]\\r\\nForeign policy is controlled by the United Kingdom, as the islands remain an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. Although in its early days, the Cayman Islands' most important relationships were with Britain and Jamaica, in recent years, as a result of economic dependence, a relationship with the United States has developed.\\r\\nThough the Cayman Islands is involved in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due to the use of their territory for narcotics trafficking and money laundering. In an attempt to address this, the government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty of 1986 with the United States, to reduce the use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have stepped up the fight against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to co-operate with foreign investigators.\\r\\nDue to their status as an overseas territory of the UK, the Cayman Islands has no representation either in the United Nations or in most other international organisations. However, the Cayman Islands still participates in some international organisations, being an associate member of Caricom and UNESCO, and a member of a sub-bureau of Interpol.[94]\\r\\nGeorge Town is the port capital of Grand Cayman. There are no berthing facilities for cruise ships, but up to 4 cruise ships can anchor in designated anchorages. There are three cruise terminals in George Town, the North, South, and Royal Watler Terminals. The ride from the ship to the terminal is about 5 minutes.[95]\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands Education Department operates state schools. Caymanian children are entitled to free primary and secondary education. There are two public high schools on Grand Cayman, John Gray High School and Clifton Hunter High School, and one on Cayman Brac, Layman E. Scott High School. Various churches and private foundations operate several private schools.\\r\\nThe University College of the Cayman Islands has campuses on Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac and is the only government-run university on the Cayman Islands.[96] A hall at the University College of the Cayman Islands is named after Sir Vassel Johnson, who The Cayman Islands Financial Services Association credited as one of the founding fathers of the financial services sector in the Cayman Islands. Sir Vassel is also the only person to ever be knighted in any British Dependent Territory. http://www.gov.ky/portal/page/portal/cighome/pressroom/archive/200811/governorstributetosirvassel\\r\\nThe International College of the Cayman Islands is a private college in Grand Cayman. The college was established in 1970 and offers associate's, bachelor's and master's degree programmes.[97] Grand Cayman is also home to St. Matthew's University, which includes a medical school and a school of veterinary medicine.[98] The Cayman Islands Law School, a branch of the University of Liverpool, is based on Grand Cayman.[99]\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands Civil Service College, a unit of Cayman Islands government organised under the Portfolio of the Civil Service, is in Grand Cayman. Co-situated with University College of the Cayman Islands, it offers both degree programs and continuing education units of various sorts. The college opened in 2007 and is also used as a government research centre.\\r\\nThere is a University of the West Indies Open campus in the territory.[100]\\r\\nThere are four hospitals in the Cayman Islands. Grand Cayman is home to the private Health City Cayman Islands as well as the Chrissie Tomlinson Memorial Hospital. The public hospitals include the Cayman Islands Hospital (commonly known as the George Town Hospital); and Faith Hospital on Cayman Brac.[101]\\r\\nIn 2007, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unit was installed at the Chrissie Tomlinson Memorial Hospital, replacing the one destroyed by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. In 2009, a stand-alone open MRI facility was opened. This centre provides MRI, CT, X-ray and DEXA (bone density) scanning. Also housed in this building is the Heart Health Centre, which provides ultrasound, nuclear medicine, echocardiography and cardiac stress testing.[102]\\r\\nFor divers and others in need of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, there is a two-person recompression chamber at the Cayman Islands Hospital on Grand Cayman, run by Cayman Hyperbaric Services. Hyperbaric Services has also built a hyperbaric unit at Faith Hospital in Cayman Brac.[103][104]\\r\\nIn 2003, the Cayman Islands became the first country in the world to mandate health insurance for all residents.[105]\\r\\nThe Royal Cayman Islands Police Service (RCIPS) provides law enforcement for the three islands. Regular off-shore marine and air patrols are conducted by the RCIP using a small fleet of vessels and a helicopter. Grand Cayman is a port of call for Britain's Royal Navy and the United States Coast Guard who often assist with sea rescues when their resources are in the Cayman Islands area. The Cayman Islands Fire Service provides fire prevention, fire fighting and rescue.[106] Its headquarters are in George Town and has substations in Frank Sound, West Bay, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman.[107] Emergency Medical Services are provided by paramedics and Emergency Medical Technicians using ambulances based in George Town, West Bay and North Side in Grand Cayman and in Cayman Brac. EMS is managed by the Government's Health Services Authority.\\r\\nAccess to Emergency Services is available using 9-1-1, the Emergency telephone number, the same number as is used in Canada and the United States. The Cayman Islands Department of Public Safety's Communications Centre processes 9-1-1 and non-emergency law enforcement, EMS, fire, and Search and Rescue calls for all three islands. The Communications Centre dispatches RCIP and EMS units directly, however, the Cayman Islands Fire Service maintains their own dispatch room at the airport fire station.[citation needed]\\r\\nTruman Bodden Sports Complex is a multi-use complex in George Town. The complex is separated into an outdoor, six-lane 25-metre (82?ft) swimming pool, full purpose track and field and basketball/netball courts. The field surrounded by the track is used for association football matches as well as other field sports. The track stadium holds 3,000 people.\\r\\nAssociation football is the national and most popular sport, with the Cayman Islands national football team representing the Cayman Islands in FIFA.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands Basketball Federation joined the international basketball governing body FIBA in 1976.[108] The country's national team attended the official 2011 Caribbean Basketball Championship for the first time.\\r\\nRugby union is a developing sport, and has its own national men's team, women's team, and Sevens team.

The Cayman Islands national cricket team represents the islands in international cricket. The team has previously played the sport at first-class, List A and Twenty20 level. It competes in Division Five of the World Cricket League.[110]\\r\\nSquash is popular in the Cayman Islands with a vibrant community of mostly ex-pats playing out of the 7 court South Sound Squash Club. In addition, the women's professional squash association hosts one of their major events each year in an all glass court being set up in Camana Bay. In December 2012, the former Cayman Open will be replaced by the Women's World Championships, the largest tournament in the world. The top Cayman men's player, Cameron Stafford is No. 2 in the Caribbean and ranked top 200 on the men's professional circuit.\\r\\nFlag football (CIFFA) has men's, women's and co-ed leagues.\\r\\nOther organised sports leagues include softball, beach volleyball, Gaelic football and ultimate frisbee.\\r\\nThe Cayman Islands Olympic Committee was founded in 1973 and was recognised by the IOC (International Olympic Committee) in 1976.\\r\\nIn the 21st century, skateboarding has become popular among the youth.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn February 2010, the first purpose built track for kart racing in the Cayman Islands was opened.[111] Corporate karting Leagues at the track have involved widespread participation with 20 local companies and 227 drivers taking part in the 2010 Summer Corporate Karting League.[112]\\r\\nThe Cayman National Cultural Foundation manages the F.J.

Because he was not tall enough to reach the pool table, he played while standing on Coca-Cola cases that he moved around. At night, while he was dreaming of playing pool, the pool table was his bed.[4]\\r\\nReyes is often referred to as \\"Bata,\\" which is Tagalog for \\"Kid\\", because there was another older pool player named Efren when he was young. To distinguish between the two, he was referred to as Efren Bata. He was also called Efrey by his colleagues (Ef from Efren and rey from Reyes).\\r\\nGambling from a young age, Reyes played three cushion billiards in the 1960s and 1970s. After establishing himself as a winner, he was discovered by promoters. This gave him the opportunity to compete in big-time tournaments. However has for instance Three-Cushion Billiards player Torbj?rn Blomdahl defeated him in his new game [5]\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, when Reyes was considered a top-class player in his homeland but not yet internationally recognized, he went to the U.S. to hustle. Popular legend claims that Reyes earned US$80,000 in a week; this feat made him a folk hero back home.[6]\\r\\nReyes began winning a number of tournaments in the U.S., Europe and parts of Asia. Thus, he started to gain attention and recognition worldwide. At the start of his career, he used aliases to hide his identity so he would be allowed to compete. By the mid-1990s, he had become one of the elite players of the Philippines, alongside Jose Parica and Francisco Bustamante.\\r\\nReyes' fame began when he won the US Open Nine Ball Championship in 1994 by defeating Nick Varner in the finals. He was the first non-American to win the event.\\r\\nTwo years later, Efren Reyes and Earl Strickland were chosen to face each other in an event called the Color of Money, named after the movie. The event was a three-day race-to-120 challenge match of 9-ball. It was held in Hong Kong, with a winner-take-all prize of US$100,000. Reyes won the match 120-117. This was the largest single-winning purse in a pool event.[1]\\r\\nAlthough Strickland was the first to win the WPA World Nine-ball Championship, Reyes, in 1999, became the first to win while it was broadcast on television. This tournament was not recognized at the time by the WPA, but Reyes was later retrospectively acknowledged as the winner of one of two world championships held in 1999. Nick Varner won the \\"official\\" world title. The two tournaments were merged for the following year, with both men listed as the champion for 1999. At the time, the Matchroom Sport-organised event in Cardiff, Wales, was called the World Professional Pool Championship (despite the entry of many non-professional players).\\r\\nIn 2001, Reyes won the International Billiard Tournament. The event was held in Tokyo, with over 700 players and a total purse of 100M ($850K). Reyes dominated the event and beat Niels Feijen in the finals 15-7 and earned the 20M[7] ($170K) first prize. At the time, this was the biggest first prize in a pool tournament.\\r\\nIn 2002 he won the $50K winner-take-all International Challenge of Champions, defeating Mika Immonen in a deciding rack after both players split sets.[8]\\r\\nNear the end of 2004, Reyes beat Marlon Manalo to become the first-ever WPA World Eight Ball Champion. With the win, he became the first player in WPA history to win world championships in two different disciplines.\\r\\nIn December 2005, Reyes won the IPT King of the Hill 8-Ball Shootout. Reyes won a record-breaking $200K for first place by beating fellow Hall of Fame member Mike \\"the Mouth\\" Sigel two sets to none (8-0 and 8-5).\\r\\nIn 2006, Reyes and Francisco Bustamante represented their country as Team Philippines in the inaugural World Cup of Pool. They defeated Team USA, Earl Strickland and Rodney Morris, to capture the title.\\r\\nThat same year, Reyes won the IPT World Open Eight-ball Championship over Rodney Morris 8-6. He earned $500K which was the largest prize money tournament in the history of pocket billiards. Unfortunately, due to IPT's financial problems, he has not been able to claim much of this money as of 2007.[9]\\r\\nIn 2009, the Filipino tandem of Efren Reyes and Francisco Bustamante beat the German pair of Ralf Souquet and Thorsten Hohmann by a grueling 11-9 score to take their second championship title. This, together with the semifinal finish of the other Filipino team of Ronato Alcano and Dennis Orcollo, was the best performance by a host nation in the tournament's history.\\r\\nIn 2010, Reyes clinched his fifth title in the 12th annual Derby City Classic as the overall champion, making him the most successful player in the tournament's history.\\r\\nHe has topped the AZ Billiards Money List five times: in 2001,[10] 2002,[11] 2004,[12] 2005[13] and 2006.[14] In 2006, he set a record by earning $646K in a single year.[14]\\r\\nHe is married to Susan Reyes. They have three children. His son, Frennie Reyes, once competed in the Asian Nine-ball Tour.\\r\\nNumerous fellow professional players have credited Reyes with being the greatest living player in the world.[15] During ESPN television commentary on a semi-finals match between Reyes and Mika Immonen at the 2000 Billiard Congress of America Open 9-Ball Championship, veteran professional Billy Incardona stated that Reyes was \\"indisputably the best player in the worldespecially when you consider all gameshe can play any game as well as anyone, maybe better than anyone.... In my opinion we're watching probably the greatest player in my lifetime and I've been watching pool for the better part of forty years.\\"[15]\\r\\nIn 1995 Billiards Digest Magazine named Reyes the Player of the Year.[16] The following year, when Reyes was ranked number one on the U.S.'s Pro Billiards Tour, the June 1996 issue of the magazine featured a poll of \\"billiard cognoscenti\\"pro players, billiards writers, industry insiders and the liketo pick the best in billiards in various categories.[16] Billiards' own elite named Reyes the best one-pocket player of all time.[16] The magazine wrote, \\"While a bevy of one-pocket geniuses abound, Efren Reyes, whose prowess in one-pocket is sometimes obscured by his 9-ball stardom, was the popular pick. Is there anything Bata can't do?\\"[16]\\r\\nIn 2003, he became the first Asian to be inducted into the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame.[17]\\r\\nReyes was appointed Philippine Sports Ambassador of the 2005 South East Asian Games alongside some of the Philippines' greatest athletes (Allan Caidic, Rafael Nepomuceno) to promote the event throughout the country.\\r\\nFor 2007, he was ranked #2 in Pool & Billiard Magazine's \\"Fans' Top 20 Favorite Players\\" poll.[18]\\r\\nOther awards and honors include:\\r\\nIn 2003, Reyes was featured in the Filipino movie Pakners with the late actor Fernando Poe, Jr., which was his last film before his run for President in 2004 and then death in latter part of 2004. Reyes also appeared in the 2007 short film Nineball.[20]\\r\\nIn one episode of the TV series Magpakailanman, the story follows a young Efren Reyes (portrayed by actor Anjo Yllana) in his early pool-playing days as he progresses from a money player to a tournament contender.\\r\\nReyes is often called by his nickname \\"Bata\\" (Filipino for \\"Kid\\"), given to him by friends at his regular pool hall to distinguish him from an older Efren.\\r\\nReyes, along with the other \\"Filipino invasion\\" players revolutionized the way pool is played by their introduction to the sport of pinpoint precision kicking (going into a rail with the cue ball and then hitting an object ball). Reyes' ability to \\"kick safe\\" and to kick balls into intended pockets is legendary. This ability, coupled with his superb skill at other aspects of the game, led U.S. professionals to give him the appellation \\"The Magician.\\" Before Reyes and his compatriots came over to the U.S., no one there had seen anything like their kicking skill set.[21]\\r\\n\\"[The] first time I came over to the states, I used an alias of Cesar Morales. Pool players in the US already knew Efren Reyes as a great shooter from the Philippines, but they [hadn't]...seen...[me]...in person.\\"  Efren Reyes[22]","input":"Who is the greatest pool player of all time?"},{"output":"February 22, 2011","context":"Windows 7 (codenamed Vienna, formerly Blackcomb[7]) is a personal computer operating system developed by Microsoft. It is a part of the Windows NT family of operating systems. Windows 7 was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and became generally available on October 22, 2009,[8] less than three years after the release of its predecessor, Windows Vista. Windows 7's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 R2, was released at the same time.\\r\\nWindows 7 was primarily intended to be an incremental upgrade to the operating system intending to address Windows Vista's poor critical reception while maintaining hardware and software compatibility. Windows 7 continued improvements on Windows Aero (the user interface introduced in Windows Vista) with the addition of a redesigned taskbar that allows applications to be \\"pinned\\" to it, and new window management features. Other new features were added to the operating system, including libraries, the new file sharing system HomeGroup, and support for multitouch input. A new \\"Action Center\\" interface was also added to provide an overview of system security and maintenance information, and tweaks were made to the User Account Control system to make it less intrusive. Windows 7 also shipped with updated versions of several stock applications, including Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player, and Windows Media Center.\\r\\nIn contrast to Windows Vista, Windows 7 was generally praised by critics, who considered the operating system to be a major improvement over its predecessor due to its increased performance, its more intuitive interface (with particular praise devoted to the new taskbar), fewer User Account Control popups, and other improvements made across the platform. Windows 7 was a major success for Microsoft; even prior to its official release, pre-order sales for 7 on the online retailer Amazon.com had surpassed previous records. In just six months, over 100?million copies had been sold worldwide, increasing to over 630?million licenses by July 2012, and a market share of 47.21% of \\"desktop operating systems\\" as of September 2017[9] according to Net Applications, making it the most widely used version of Windows (while Windows 10 is now more popular in Europe and North America).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, a version of Windows codenamed Blackcomb was planned as the successor to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 in 2000. Major features were planned for Blackcomb, including an emphasis on searching and querying data and an advanced storage system named WinFS to enable such scenarios. However, an interim, minor release, codenamed \\"Longhorn,\\" was announced for 2003, delaying the development of Blackcomb.[10] By the middle of 2003, however, Longhorn had acquired some of the features originally intended for Blackcomb. After three major viruses: the Blaster, Nachi, and Sobig worms, exploited flaws in Windows operating systems within a short time period in August 2003,[11] Microsoft changed its development priorities, putting some of Longhorn's major development work on hold while developing new service packs for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Development of Longhorn (Windows Vista) was also restarted, and thus delayed, in August 2004. A number of features were cut from Longhorn.[12] Blackcomb was renamed Vienna in early 2006.[13]\\r\\nWhen released, Windows Vista was criticized for its long development time, performance issues, its spotty compatibility with existing hardware and software on launch, changes affecting the compatibility of certain PC games, and unclear assurances by Microsoft that certain computers shipping with XP prior to launch would be \\"Vista Capable\\" (which led to a class action lawsuit), among other critiques. As such, adoption of Vista in comparison to XP remained somewhat low.[14][15][16] In July 2007, six months following the public release of Vista, it was reported that the next version of Windows would then be codenamed Windows 7, with plans for a final release within three years.[17][18] Bill Gates, in an interview with Newsweek, suggested that Windows 7 would be more \\"user-centric\\".[19] Gates later said that Windows 7 would also focus on performance improvements.[20] Steven Sinofsky later expanded on this point, explaining in the Engineering Windows 7 blog that the company was using a variety of new tracing tools to measure the performance of many areas of the operating system on an ongoing basis, to help locate inefficient code paths and to help prevent performance regressions.[21] Senior Vice President Bill Veghte stated that Windows Vista users migrating to Windows 7 would not find the kind of device compatibility issues they encountered migrating from Windows XP.[22] An estimated 1,000 developers worked on Windows 7. These were broadly divided into \\"core operating system\\" and \\"Windows client experience\\", in turn organized into 25 teams of around 40 developers on average.[23]\\r\\nIn October 2008, it was announced that Windows 7 would also be the official name of the operating system.[24][25] There has been some confusion over naming the product Windows 7,[26] while versioning it as 6.1 to indicate its similar build to Vista and increase compatibility with applications that only check major version numbers, similar to Windows 2000 and Windows XP both having 5.x version numbers.[27] The first external release to select Microsoft partners came in January 2008 with Milestone 1, build 6519.[28] Speaking about Windows 7 on October 16, 2008, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer confirmed compatibility between Windows Vista and Windows 7, indicating that Windows 7 would be a refined version of Windows Vista.[29]\\r\\nAt PDC 2008, Microsoft demonstrated Windows 7 with its reworked taskbar.[30] On December 27, 2008, the Windows 7 Beta was leaked onto the Internet via BitTorrent.[31] According to a performance test by ZDNet,[32] Windows 7 Beta beat both Windows XP and Vista in several key areas, including boot and shutdown time and working with files, such as loading documents. Other areas did not beat XP, including PC Pro benchmarks for typical office activities and video editing, which remain identical to Vista and slower than XP.[33] On January 7, 2009, the x64 version of the Windows 7 Beta (build 7000) was leaked onto the web, with some torrents being infected with a trojan.[34][35] At CES 2009, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced the Windows 7 Beta, build 7000, had been made available for download to MSDN and TechNet subscribers in the format of an ISO image.[36] The Beta was to be publicly released January 9, 2009, and Microsoft initially planned for the download to be made available to 2.5?million people on this date. However, access to the downloads was delayed because of high traffic.[37] The download limit was also extended, initially until January 24, then again to February 10. People who did not complete downloading the beta had two extra days to complete the download, and, after February 12, unfinished downloads became unable to complete. Users could still obtain product keys from Microsoft to activate their copies of Windows 7 Beta, which expired on August 1, 2009.\\r\\nThe release candidate, build 7100, became available for MSDN and TechNet subscribers and Connect Program participants on April 30, 2009. On May 5, 2009, it became available to the general public, although it had also been leaked onto the Internet via BitTorrent.[38] The release candidate was available in five languages and expired on June 1, 2010, with shutdowns every two hours starting March 1, 2010.[39] Microsoft stated that Windows 7 would be released to the general public on October 22, 2009. Microsoft released Windows 7 to MSDN and Technet subscribers on August 6, 2009, at 10:00?am PDT.[40] Microsoft announced that Windows 7, along with Windows Server 2008 R2, was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009. Windows 7 RTM is build 7600.16385.090713-1255, which was compiled on July 13, 2009, and was declared the final RTM build after passing all Microsoft's tests internally.[41]\\r\\nAmong Windows 7's new features are advances in touch and handwriting recognition,[42] support for virtual hard disks,[43] improved performance on multi-core processors,[44][45][46][47] improved boot performance, DirectAccess, and kernel improvements. Windows 7 adds support for systems using multiple heterogeneous graphics cards from different vendors (Heterogeneous Multi-adapter),[48] a new version of Windows Media Center,[49] a Gadget for Windows Media Center, improved media features, XPS Essentials Pack[50] and Windows PowerShell[51] being included, and a redesigned Calculator with multiline capabilities including Programmer and Statistics modes along with unit conversion for length, weight, temperature, and several others.[52] Many new items have been added to the Control Panel, including ClearType Text Tuner[53] Display Color Calibration Wizard,[54] Gadgets, Recovery, Troubleshooting, Workspaces Center, Location and Other Sensors, Credential Manager, Biometric Devices, System Icons, and Display.[55] Windows Security Center has been renamed to Windows Action Center (Windows Health Center and Windows Solution Center in earlier builds), which encompasses both security and maintenance of the computer. ReadyBoost on 32-bit editions now supports up to 256?gigabytes of extra allocation. Windows 7 also supports images in RAW image format through the addition of Windows Imaging Component-enabled image decoders, which enables raw image thumbnails, previewing and metadata display in Windows Explorer, plus full-size viewing and slideshows in Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Center.[56] Windows 7 also has a native TFTP client with the ability to transfer files to or from a TFTP server.[57]\\r\\nThe taskbar has seen the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick Launch toolbar has been replaced with the ability to pin applications to taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to common tasks.[58] The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the Show desktop icon. By default, hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for a quick look at the desktop.[59] In touch-enabled displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly (8 pixels) wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger.[60] Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them.\\r\\nWindow management in Windows 7 has several new features: Snap maximizes a window when it is dragged to the top of the screen.[61] Dragging windows to the left or right edges of the screen allows users to snap software windows to either side of the screen, such that the windows take up half the screen. When a user moves windows that were snapped or maximized using Snap, the system restores their previous state. Snap functions can also be triggered with keyboard shortcuts. Shake hides all inactive windows when the active window's title bar is dragged back and forth rapidly (metaphorically shaken).\\r\\nWindows 7 includes 13 additional sound schemes, titled Afternoon, Calligraphy, Characters, Cityscape, Delta, Festival, Garden, Heritage, Landscape, Quirky, Raga, Savanna, and Sonata.[62] Internet Spades, Internet Backgammon and Internet Checkers, which were removed from Windows Vista, were restored in Windows 7. Users are able to disable or customize many more Windows components than was possible in Windows Vista. New additions to this list of components include Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player 12, Windows Media Center, Windows Search, and Windows Gadget Platform.[63] A new version of Microsoft Virtual PC, newly renamed as Windows Virtual PC was made available for Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions.[64] It allows multiple Windows environments, including Windows XP Mode, to run on the same machine. Windows XP Mode runs Windows XP in a virtual machine, and displays applications within separate windows on the Windows 7 desktop.[65] Furthermore, Windows 7 supports the mounting of a virtual hard disk (VHD) as a normal data storage, and the bootloader delivered with Windows 7 can boot the Windows system from a VHD; however, this ability is only available in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions.[66] The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) of Windows 7 is also enhanced to support real-time multimedia application including video playback and 3D games, thus allowing use of DirectX 10 in remote desktop environments.[67] The three application limit, previously present in the Windows Vista and Windows XP Starter Editions, has been removed from Windows 7.[68] All editions include some new and improved features, such as Windows Search, Security features, and some features new to Windows 7, that originated within Vista. Optional BitLocker Drive Encryption is included with Windows 7 Ultimate and Enterprise. Windows Defender is included; Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus software is a free download. All editions include Shadow Copy, whichevery day or soSystem Restore uses to take an automatic \\"previous version\\" snapshot of user files that have changed.[69] Backup and restore have also been improved,[70][71] and the Windows Recovery Environmentinstalled by defaultreplaces the optional Recovery Console of Windows XP.[72]\\r\\nA new system known as \\"Libraries\\" was added for file management; users can aggregate files from multiple folders into a \\"Library\\". By default, libraries for categories such as Documents, Pictures, Music, and Video are created, consisting of the user's personal folder and the Public folder for each. The system is also used as part of a new home networking system known as HomeGroup; devices are added to the network with a password, and files and folders can be shared with all other devices in the HomeGroup, or with specific users. The default libraries, along with printers, are shared by default, but the personal folder is set to read-only access by other users, and the Public folder can be accessed by anyone.[73][74]\\r\\nWindows 7 includes improved globalization support through a new Extended Linguistic Services API[75] to provide multilingual support (particularly in Ultimate and Enterprise editions). Microsoft has also implemented better support for solid-state drives,[76] including the new TRIM command, and Windows 7 is able to identify a solid-state drive uniquely. Native support for USB 3.0 is not included due to delays in the finalization of the standard.[77] At WinHEC 2008?Microsoft announced that color depths of 30-bit and 48-bit would be supported in Windows 7 along with the wide color gamut scRGB (which for HDMI 1.3 can be converted and output as xvYCC). The video modes supported in Windows 7 are 16-bit sRGB, 24-bit sRGB, 30-bit sRGB, 30-bit with extended color gamut sRGB, and 48-bit scRGB.[78][79]\\r\\nFor developers, Windows 7 includes a new networking API with support for building SOAP-based web services in native code (as opposed to .NET-based WCF web services),[80] new features to simplify development of installation packages and shorten application install times.[81] Windows 7, by default, generates fewer User Account Control (UAC) prompts because it allows digitally signed Windows components to gain elevated privileges without a prompt. Additionally, users can now adjust the level at which UAC operates using a sliding scale.[82]\\r\\nCertain capabilities and programs that were a part of Windows Vista are no longer present or have been changed, resulting in the removal of certain functionalities; these include the classic Start Menu user interface, some taskbar features, Windows Explorer features, Windows Media Player features, Windows Ultimate Extras, Search button, and InkBall. Four applications bundled with Windows Vista  Windows Photo Gallery, Windows Movie Maker, Windows Calendar and Windows Mail  are not included with Windows 7 and were replaced by Windows Live-branded versions as part of the Windows Live Essentials suite.[83][84]\\r\\nWindows 7 is available in six different editions, of which the Home Premium, Professional, and Ultimate were available at retail in most countries, and as pre-loaded software on new computers. Home Premium and Professional were aimed at home users and small businesses respectively, while Ultimate was aimed at enthusiasts. Each edition of Windows 7 includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition below it, and adds additional features oriented towards their market segments; for example, Professional adds additional networking and security features such as Encrypting File System and the ability to join a domain. Ultimate contained a superset of the features from Home Premium and Professional, along with other advanced features oriented towards power users, such as BitLocker drive encryption; unlike Windows Vista, there were no \\"Ultimate Extras\\" add-ons created for Windows 7 Ultimate.[85][86][87] Retail copies were available in \\"upgrade\\" and higher-cost \\"full\\" version licenses; \\"upgrade\\" licenses require an existing version of Windows to install, while \\"full\\" licenses can be installed on computers with no existing operating system.[88]\\r\\nThe remaining three editions were not available at retail, of which two were available exclusively through OEM channels as pre-loaded software. The Starter edition is a stripped-down version of Windows 7 meant for low-cost devices such as netbooks. In comparison to Home Premium, Starter has reduced multimedia functionality, does not allow users to change their desktop wallpaper or theme, disables the \\"Aero Glass\\" theme, does not have support for multiple monitors, and can only address 2GB of RAM.[87][89] Home Basic was sold only in emerging markets, and was positioned in between Home Premium and Starter.[85][86] The highest edition, Enterprise, is functionally similar to Ultimate, but is only sold through volume licensing via Microsoft's Software Assurance program.[90][91][92]\\r\\nAll editions aside from Starter support both IA-32 and x86-64 architectures; Starter only supports 32-bit systems.[87] Retail copies of Windows 7 are distributed on two DVDs: one for the IA-32 version and the other for x86-64. OEM copies include one DVD, depending on the processor architecture licensed. The installation media for consumer versions of Windows 7 are identical; the product key and corresponding license determines the edition that is installed. The Windows Anytime Upgrade service can be used to purchase an upgrade that unlocks the functionality of a higher edition, such as going from Starter to Home Premium, and Home Premium to Ultimate.[85] Most copies of Windows 7 only contained one license; in certain markets, a \\"Family Pack\\" version of Windows 7 Home Premium was also released for a limited time, which allowed upgrades on up to three computers.[93] In certain regions, copies of Windows 7 were only sold in, and could only be activated in a designated region.[94]\\r\\nSupport for Windows 7 without Service Pack 1 ended on April 9, 2013, requiring users to update in order to continue receiving updates and support.[95] Microsoft ended the sale of new retail copies of Windows 7 in October 2014, and the sale of new OEM licenses for Windows 7 Home Basic, Home Premium, and Ultimate ended on October 31, 2014. Professional currently remains available to OEMs, primarily as part of downgrade rights for Windows 8 and 10 licenses. OEM sales of PCs with Windows 7 Professional preinstalled ended on October 31, 2016.[96] The sale of non-Professional OEM licences was stopped on October 31, 2014.[97] Mainstream support for 7 ended on January 13, 2015. Extended support will end on January 14, 2020.[98]\\r\\nAdditional requirements to use certain features:[99]\\r\\nThe maximum amount of RAM that Windows 7 supports varies depending on the product edition and on the processor architecture, as shown in the following table.[102]\\r\\nWindows 7 Professional and up support up to 2 physical processors (CPU sockets),[103] whereas Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, and Home Premium editions support only 1.[104] Physical processors with either multiple cores, or hyper-threading, or both, implement more than one logical processor per physical processor. The x86 editions of Windows 7 support up to 32 logical processors; x64 editions support up to 256 (4 x 64).[105]\\r\\nIn January 2016, Microsoft announced that it would no longer support Windows platforms older than Windows 10 on any future Intel-compatible processor lines, citing difficulties in reliably allowing the operating system to operate on newer hardware. Microsoft stated that effective July 17, 2017, devices with Intel Skylake CPUs were only to receive the \\"most critical\\" updates for Windows 7 and 8.1, and only if they have been judged not to affect the reliability of Windows 7 on older hardware.[98][106] For enterprise customers, Microsoft issued a list of Skylake-based devices \\"certified\\" for Windows 7 and 8.1 in addition to Windows 10, to assist them in migrating to newer hardware that can eventually be upgraded to 10 once they are ready to transition. Microsoft and their hardware partners provide special testing and support for these devices on 7 and 8.1 until the July 2017 date.[107]\\r\\nOn March 18, 2016, in response to criticism from enterprise customers, Microsoft delayed the end of support and non-critical updates for Skylake systems to July 17, 2018, but stated that they would also continue to receive security updates through the end of extended support.[108][109] In August 2016, citing a \\"strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel\\", Microsoft retracted the decision and stated that it would continue to support Windows 7 and 8.1 on Skylake hardware through the end of their extended support lifecycle. However, the restrictions on newer CPU microarchitectures remain in force.[110][111]\\r\\nIn March 2017, a Microsoft knowledge base article was discovered which implies that devices using Intel Kaby Lake, AMD Bristol Ridge, or AMD Ryzen, would be blocked from using Windows Update entirely.[112][113] In addition, official Windows 7 device drivers are not available for the Kaby Lake and Ryzen platforms.[114][115]\\r\\nWindows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) was announced on March 18, 2010. A beta was released on July 12, 2010.[116][117][118] The final version was released to the public on February 22, 2011.[119] At the time of release, it was not made mandatory. It was available via Windows Update, direct download, or by ordering the Windows 7 SP1 DVD.[120] The service pack is on a much smaller scale than those released for previous versions of Windows, particularly Windows Vista.[121]\\r\\nWindows 7 Service Pack 1 adds support for Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX), a 256-bit instruction set extension for processors, and improves IKEv2 by adding additional identification fields such as E-mail ID to it. In addition, it adds support for Advanced Format 512e as well as additional Identity Federation Services.[122][123] Windows 7 Service Pack 1 also resolves a bug related to HDMI audio and another related to printing XPS documents.[122]\\r\\nIn Europe, the automatic nature of the BrowserChoice.eu feature was dropped in Windows 7 Service Pack 1 in February 2011 and remained absent for 14?months despite Microsoft reporting that it was still present, subsequently described by Microsoft as a \\"technical error\\". As a result, in March 2013 the European Commission fined Microsoft ?561?million to deter companies from reneging on settlement promises.[124]\\r\\nWindows Management Framework 5.0 includes updates to Windows PowerShell, Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC), Windows Remote Management (WinRM), Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

PC Magazine rated it a 4 out of 5 saying that Windows 7 is a \\"big improvement\\" over Windows Vista, with fewer compatibility problems, a retooled taskbar, simpler home networking and faster start-up.[134] Maximum PC gave Windows 7 a rating of 9 out of 10 and called Windows 7 a \\"massive leap forward\\" in usability and security, and praised the new Taskbar as \\"worth the price of admission alone\\".[135] PC World called Windows 7 a \\"worthy successor\\" to Windows XP and said that speed benchmarks showed Windows 7 to be slightly faster than Windows Vista.[136] PC World also named Windows 7 one of the best products of the year.[137] In its review of Windows 7, Engadget said that Microsoft had taken a \\"strong step forward\\" with Windows 7 and reported that speed is one of Windows 7's major selling points ÿ particularly for the netbook sets.[138] Laptop Magazine gave Windows 7 a rating of 4 out of 5 stars and said that Windows 7 makes computing more intuitive, offered better overall performance including a \\"modest to dramatic\\" increase in battery life on laptop computers.[139] TechRadar gave Windows 7 a rating of 5 out of 5 stars, concluding that \\"it combines the security and architectural improvements of Windows Vista with better performance than XP can deliver on today's hardware. No version of Windows is ever perfect, but Windows 7 really is the best release of Windows yet.\\"[140] The New York Times,[141] USA Today,[142] The Wall Street Journal,[143] and The Telegraph[144] also gave Windows 7 favorable reviews.\\r\\nSome Windows Vista Ultimate users have expressed concerns over Windows 7 pricing and upgrade options.[145][146] Windows Vista Ultimate users wanting to upgrade from Windows Vista to Windows 7 must either pay $219.99[147] to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate or perform a clean install, which requires them to reinstall all of their programs.[148]\\r\\nThe changes to User Account Control on Windows 7 were criticized for being potentially insecure, as an exploit was discovered allowing untrusted software to be launched with elevated privileges by exploiting a trusted component. Peter Bright of Ars Technica argued that \\"the way that the Windows 7 UAC 'improvements' have been made completely exempts Microsoft's developers from having to do that work themselves.

Fresh water includes water in ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, and even underground water called groundwater. Fresh water is generally characterized by having low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total dissolved solids. Though the term specifically excludes seawater and brackish water, it does include mineral-rich waters such as chalybeate springs. \\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water is not the same as potable water (or drinking water). Much of the earth's fresh water (on the surface and groundwater) is unsuitable for drinking without some treatment. Fresh water can easily become polluted by human activities or due to naturally occurring processes, such as erosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater is critical to the survival of all living organisms. Some organisms can thrive on salt water, but the great majority of higher plants and most mammals need fresh water to live. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"sweet water\\" is used to describe fresh water in contrast to salt water.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water can be defined as water with less than 500 parts per million (ppm) of dissolved salts.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther sources give higher upper salinity limits for fresh water, e.g. 1000 ppm[2]\\r\\nor 3000 ppm.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water habitats are divided into lentic systems, which are the stillwaters including ponds, lakes, swamps and mires; lotic, or running-water systems; and groundwater which flows in rocks and aquifers. There is, in addition, a zone which bridges between groundwater and lotic systems, which is the hyporheic zone, which underlies many larger rivers and can contain substantially more water than is seen in the open channel. It may also be in direct contact with the underlying underground water. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of fresh water on Earth is in ice caps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled.  In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn coastal areas fresh water may contain significant concentrations of salts derived from the sea if windy conditions have lifted drops of seawater into the rain-bearing clouds. This can give rise to elevated concentrations of sodium, chloride, magnesium and sulfate as well as many other compounds in smaller concentrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn desert areas, or areas with impoverished or dusty soils, rain-bearing winds can pick up sand and dust and this can be deposited elsewhere in precipitation and causing the freshwater flow to be measurably contaminated both by insoluble solids but also by the soluble components of those soils. Significant quantities of iron may be transported in this way including the well-documented transfer of iron-rich rainfall falling in Brazil derived from sand-storms in the Sahara in north Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of all the water on Earth, saline water in oceans, seas and saline groundwater make up about 97% of it. Only 2.5ÿ2.75% is fresh water, including 1.75ÿ2% frozen in glaciers, ice and snow, 0.5ÿ0.75% as fresh groundwater and soil moisture, and less than 0.01% of it as surface water in lakes, swamps and rivers.[5][6] Freshwater lakes contain about 87% of this fresh surface water, including 29% in the African Great Lakes, 22% in Lake Baikal in Russia, 21% in the North American Great Lakes, and 14% in other lakes. Swamps have most of the balance with only a small amount in rivers, most notably the Amazon River. The atmosphere contains 0.04% water.[7] In areas with no fresh water on the ground surface, fresh water derived from precipitation may, because of its lower density, overlie saline ground water in lenses or layers. Most of the world's fresh water is frozen in ice sheets. Many areas suffer from lack of distribution of fresh water, such as deserts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater is a critical issue for the survival of all living organisms. Some can use salt water but many organisms including the great majority of higher plants and most mammals must have access to fresh water to live. Some terrestrial mammals, especially desert rodents appear to survive without drinking but they do generate water through the metabolism of cereal seeds and they also have mechanisms to conserve water to the maximum degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water creates a hypotonic environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for some organisms with pervious skins or with gill membranes, whose cell membranes may burst if excess water is not excreted. Some protists accomplish this using contractile vacuoles, while freshwater fish excrete excess water via the kidney.[8] Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, diadromous fish have the ability to migrate between fresh water and saline water bodies. During these migrations they undergo changes to adapt to the surroundings of the changed salinities; these processes are hormonally controlled. The eel (Anguilla anguilla) uses the hormone prolactin,[9] while in salmon (Salmo salar) the hormone cortisol plays a key role during this process.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany sea birds have special glands at the base of the bill through which excess salt is excreted. Similarly the marine iguanas on the Galpagos Islands excrete excess salt through a nasal gland and they sneeze out a very salty excretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreshwater molluscs include freshwater snails and freshwater bivalves. Freshwater crustaceans include freshwater crabs and crayfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water is a renewable and variable, but finite natural resource.  Fresh water can only be replenished through the process of the water cycle, in which water from seas, lakes, forests, land, rivers, and reservoirs evaporates, forms clouds, and returns as precipitation. Locally however, if more fresh water is consumed through human activities than is naturally restored, this may result in reduced fresh water availability from surface and underground sources and can cause serious damage to surrounding and associated environments.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh and unpolluted water accounts for 0.003% of total water available globally.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe increase in the world population and the increase in per capita water use puts increasing strains on the finite resources availability of clean fresh water. The World Bank adds that the response by freshwater ecosystems to a changing climate can be described in terms of three interrelated components: water quality, water quantity or volume, and water timing. A change in one often leads to shifts in the others as well.[12] Water pollution and subsequent eutrophication  also reduces the availability of fresh water.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany areas of the world are already experiencing stress on water availability (or water scarcity). Due to the accelerated pace of population growth and an increase in the amount of water a single person uses, it is expected that this situation will continue to get worse. A shortage of water in the future would be detrimental to the human population as it would affect everything from sanitation, to overall health and the production of grain.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important concern for hydrological ecosystems is securing minimum streamflow, especially preserving and restoring instream water allocations.[15] Fresh water is an important natural resource necessary for the survival of all ecosystems.  The use of water by humans for activities such as irrigation and industrial applications can have adverse impacts on down-stream ecosystems.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water withdrawal is the quantity of water removed from available sources for use in any purpose, excluding evaporation losses.\\r\\nWater drawn off is not necessarily entirely consumed and some portion may be returned for further use downstream.\\r\\n\\r\\nPollution from human activity, including oil spills and also presents a problem for freshwater resources.  The largest petroleum spill that has ever occurred in fresh water was caused by a Royal Dutch Shell tank ship in Magdalena, Argentina, on 15 January 1999, polluting the environment, drinkable water, plants and animals.[16] Chemical contamination of fresh water can also seriously damage eco-systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanging landscape for the use of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of fresh water. Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and soils changes the flow of fresh water in the local environment and also affects the cycle of fresh water. As a result, more fresh water is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture. However, since agriculture is the human activity that consumes the most fresh water,[17] this can put a severe strain on local freshwater resources resulting in the destruction of local ecosystems. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia,  over-abstraction of fresh water for intensive irrigation activities has caused 33% of the land area to be at risk of salination.[17] With regards to agriculture, the World Bank targets food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that will foster debate.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne in eight people in the world do not having access to safe water[19] Innapropriate use of water may contribute to this problem.

The park is managed by the National Park Service.\\r\\nThe Badlands Wilderness protects 64,144 acres (100.225?sq?mi; 25,958?ha) of the park as a designated wilderness area[4] and is the site of the reintroduction of the black-footed ferret, the most endangered land mammal in North America.[5]\\r\\nThe South Unit, or Stronghold Unit, is co-managed with the Oglala Lakota tribe[6] and includes sites of 1890s Ghost Dances,[7] a former United States Air Force bomb and gunnery range,[8] and Red Shirt Table, the park's highest point at 3,340 feet (1,020?m).[9]\\r\\nAuthorized as Badlands National Monument on March 4, 1929, it was not established until January 25, 1939. It was redesignated a national park on November 10, 1978.[10]\\r\\nUnder the Mission 66 plan, the Ben Reifel Visitor Center was constructed for the monument in 1957ÿ58. The park also administers the nearby Minuteman Missile National Historic Site.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals that inhabit this park include:[6]\\r\\nPrairie dog\\r\\nBighorn sheep\\r\\nBison bull\\r\\nFor 11,000 years, Native Americans have used this area for their hunting grounds. Long before the Lakota were the little-studied paleo-Indians, followed by the Arikara people. Their descendants live today in North Dakota as a part of the Three Affiliated Tribes. Archaeological records combined with oral traditions indicate that these people camped in secluded valleys where fresh water and game were available year round. Eroding out of the stream banks today are the rocks and charcoal of their campfires, as well as the arrowheads and tools they used to butcher bison, rabbits, and other game. From the top of the Badlands Wall, they could scan the area for enemies and wandering herds. If hunting was good, they might hang on into winter, before retracing their way to their villages along the Missouri River. By one hundred and fifty years ago, the Great Sioux Nation consisting of seven bands including the Oglala Lakota, had displaced the other tribes from the northern prairie.\\r\\nThe next great change came toward the end of the 19th century as homesteaders moved into South Dakota. The U.S. government stripped Native Americans of much of their territory and forced them to live on reservations. In the fall and early winter of 1890, thousands of Native American followers, including many Oglala Sioux, became followers of the Indian prophet Wovoka. His vision called for the native people to dance the Ghost Dance and wear Ghost shirts, which would be impervious to bullets. Wovoka had predicted that the white man would vanish and their hunting grounds would be restored. One of the last known Ghost Dances was conducted on Stronghold Table in the South Unit of Badlands National Park. As winter closed in, the ghost dancers returned to Pine Ridge Agency. The climax of the struggle came in late December, 1890. Headed south from the Cheyenne River, a band of Minneconjou Sioux crossed a pass in the Badlands Wall. Pursued by units of the U.S. Army, they were seeking refuge in the Pine Ridge Reservation. The band, led by Chief Spotted Elk,[11] was finally overtaken by the soldiers near Wounded Knee Creek in the Reservation and ordered to camp there overnight. The troops attempted to disarm Big Foot's band the next morning. Gunfire erupted. Before it was over, nearly three hundred Indians and thirty soldiers lay dead. The Wounded Knee Massacre was the last major clash between Plains Indians and the U.S. military until the advent of the American Indian Movement in the 1970s, most notably in the 1973 standoff at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.\\r\\nWounded Knee is not within the boundaries of Badlands National Park. It is located approximately 45 miles (72?km) south of the park on Pine Ridge Reservation. The U.S. government and the Oglala Lakota Nation have agreed that this is a story to be told by the Oglala of Pine Ridge and Minneconjou of Standing Rock Reservation. The interpretation of the site and its tragic events are held as the primary responsibility of these survivors.\\r\\nThe history of the White River Badlands as a significant paleontological resource goes back to the traditional Native American knowledge of the area. The Lakota found large fossilized bones, fossilized seashells and turtle shells. They correctly assumed that the area had once been under water, and that the bones belonged to creatures which no longer existed.[citation needed] Paleontological interest in this area began in the 1840s. Trappers and traders regularly traveled the 300 miles (480?km) from Fort Pierre to Fort Laramie along a path which skirted the edge of what is now Badlands National Park. Fossils were occasionally collected, and in 1843 a fossilized jaw fragment collected by Alexander Culbertson of the American Fur Company found its way to a physician in St. Louis by the name of Dr. Hiram A. Prout.\\r\\nIn 1846, Prout published a paper about the jaw in the American Journal of Science in which he stated that it had come from a creature he called a Paleotherium. Shortly after the publication, the White River Badlands became popular fossil hunting grounds and, within a couple of decades, numerous new fossil species had been discovered in the White River Badlands. In 1849, Dr. Joseph Leidy published a paper on an Oligocene camel and renamed Prout's Paleotherium, Titanotherium prouti. By 1854 when he published a series of papers about North American fossils, 84 distinct species had been discovered in North America?ÿ 77 of which were found in the White River Badlands. In 1870 a Yale professor, O. C. Marsh, visited the region and developed more refined methods of extracting and reassembling fossils into nearly complete skeletons. From 1899 to today, the South Dakota School of Mines has sent people almost every year and remains one of the most active research institutions working in the White River Badlands. Throughout the late 19th century and continuing today, scientists and institutions from all over the world have benefited from the fossil resources of the White River Badlands. The White River Badlands have developed an international reputation as a fossil-rich area. They contain the richest deposits of Oligocene mammals known, providing a brief glimpse of life in this area 33 million years ago.\\r\\nAspects of American homesteading began before the end of the American Civil War; however, it did not affect the Badlands until the 20th century. Then, many hopeful farmers traveled to South Dakota from Europe or the eastern United States to try to seek out a living in the area. The standard size for a homestead was 160 acres (65?ha). Being in a semi-arid, wind-swept environment, this proved far too small of a holding to support a family. In 1916, in the western Dakotas, the size of a homestead was increased to 640 acres (260?ha). Cattle grazed the land, and crops such as winter wheat and hay were cut annually. However, the Great Dust Bowl events of the 1930s, combined with waves of grasshoppers, proved too much for most of the settlers of the Badlands. Houses, which had been built out of sod blocks and heated by buffalo chips, were abandoned. Those who remained today ranch and raise wheat.\\r\\nAs part of the World War II effort, the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) took possession of 341,726 acres (138,292?ha) of land on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home of the Oglala Sioux people, for a gunnery range. Included in this range was 337 acres (136?ha) from the Badlands National Monument. This land was used extensively from 1942 through 1945 as an air-to-air and air-to-ground gunnery range including both precision and demolition bombing exercises. After the war, portions of the bombing range were used as an artillery range by the South Dakota National Guard. In 1968, most of the range was declared excess property by the USAF though 2,500 acres (1,000?ha) are retained by the USAF but no longer used, the majority of the land was turned over to the National Park Service.\\r\\nFiring took place within most of the present day Stronghold District. Land was bought or leased from individual landowners and the Tribe in order to clear the area of human occupation. Old car bodies and 55 gallon drums painted bright yellow were used as targets. Bulls-eyes 250 feet (76?m) across were plowed into the ground and used as targets by bombardiers. Small automatic aircraft called \\"target drones\\" and 60-by-8-foot (18 by 2?m) screens dragged behind planes served as mobile targets. Today, the ground is littered with discarded bullet cases and unexploded ordnance.\\r\\nIn the 1940s, 125 families were forcibly relocated from their farms and ranches, including Dewey Beard, a survivor of the Wounded Knee Massacre. Those that remained nearby recall times when they had to dive under tractors while out cutting hay to avoid bombs dropped by planes miles outside of the boundary. In the town of Interior, both a church and the building housing the current post office were struck by six inch (152?mm) shells through the roof. Pilots operating out of Ellsworth Air Force Base near Rapid City found it a real challenge to determine the exact boundaries of the range. Fortunately, there were no civilian casualties. However, at least a dozen flight crew personnel lost their lives in plane crashes.\\r\\nThe Stronghold District of Badlands National Park offers more than scenic badlands with spectacular views. Co-managed by the National Park Service and the Oglala Lakota Tribe, this 133,300-acre (53,900?ha) area is steeped in history. Deep draws, high tables and rolling prairie hold the stories of the earliest plains hunters, the paleo-Indians, as well as the present day Lakota Nation.\\r\\nBadlands National Park has two campgrounds for overnight visits.[12] The Ben Reifel Visitor Center within the park offers a bookstore, special programs, and exhibits.\\r\\nPinnacles and spires\\r\\nSunset\\r\\nCliff Shelf Nature Trail Boardwalk through the Cedar (Juniper) Forest.\\r\\nDoor Trail boardwalk 'Brule Formation' is the surface (30-34 MYA) Eocene\\r\\nThe ladder on the Notch trail\\r\\nBoardwalk to the Windows\\r\\nBig Badlands overlook peaks above the upper grasslands.\\r\\nChanging Scenes Overlook\\r\\nPrairie Wind Overlook in the Badlands of South Dakota.

Rather, these ideas and concepts are models for the organization of space and form within a building or collection of buildings, based on their functions in relation to each other, their usage and to the overall fabric of the Vastu.[10] Ancient Vastu Shastra principles include those for the design of Mandir (Hindu temples),[11] and the principles for the design and layout of houses, towns, cities, gardens, roads, water works, shops and other public areas.[6][12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sanskrit word vastu means a dwelling or house with a corresponding plot of land.[14] The vrddhi, vstu, takes the meaning of \\"the site or foundation of a house, site, ground, building or dwelling-place, habitation, homestead, house\\". The underlying root is vas \\"to dwell, live, stay, reside\\".[15] The term shastra may loosely be translated as \\"doctrine, teaching\\".\\r\\nVastu-Sastras (literally, science of dwelling) are ancient Sanskrit manuals of architecture. These contain Vastu-Vidya (literally, knowledge of dwelling).[16]\\r\\nHistorians such as James Fergusson, Alexander Cunningham and Dr. Havell have suggested that Vastu Shastra developed between 6000 BCE and 3000 BCE, adding that the archaeological sites of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro stand on the principles of Vastu Shashtra.[17][verification needed]\\r\\nThere exist many Vastu-Sastras on the art of building houses, temples, towns and cities. One such Vastu Sastra is by Thakkura Pheru, describing where and how temples should be built.[8][19] By 6th century AD, Sanskrit manuals for constructing palatial temples were in circulation in India.[20] Vastu-Sastra manuals included chapters on home construction, town planning,[16] and how efficient villages, towns and kingdoms integrated temples, water bodies and gardens within them to achieve harmony with nature.[12][13] While it is unclear, states Barnett,[21] as to whether these temple and town planning texts were theoretical studies and if or when they were properly implemented in practice, the manuals suggest that town planning and Hindu temples were conceived as ideals of art and integral part of Hindu social and spiritual life.[16]\\r\\nThe Silpa Prakasa of Odisha, authored by Ramacandra Bhattaraka Kaulacara sometime in ninth or tenth century CE, is another Vastu Sastra.[22] Silpa Prakasa describes the geometric principles in every aspect of the temple and symbolism such as 16 emotions of human beings carved as 16 types of female figures. These styles were perfected in Hindu temples prevalent in eastern states of India. Other ancient texts found expand these architectural principles, suggesting that different parts of India developed, invented and added their own interpretations. For example, in Saurastra tradition of temple building found in western states of India, the feminine form, expressions and emotions are depicted in 32 types of Nataka-stri compared to 16 types described in Silpa Prakasa.[22] Silpa Prakasa provides brief introduction to 12 types of Hindu temples. Other texts, such as Pancaratra Prasada Prasadhana compiled by Daniel Smith[23] and Silpa Ratnakara compiled by Narmada Sankara[24] provide a more extensive list of Hindu temple types.\\r\\nAncient Sanskrit manuals for temple construction discovered in Rajasthan, in northwestern region of India, include Sutradhara Mandanas Prasadamandana (literally, manual for planning and building a temple) with chapters on town building.[25] Manasara shilpa and Mayamata, texts of South Indian origin, estimated to be in circulation by 5th to 7th century AD, is a guidebook on South Indian Vastu design and construction.[8][26] Isanasivagurudeva paddhati is another Sanskrit text from the 9th century describing the art of building in India in south and central India.[8][27] In north India, Brihat-samhita by Varhamihira is the widely cited ancient Sanskrit manual from 6th century describing the design and construction of Nagara style of Hindu temples.[18][28][29]\\r\\nThese ancient Vastu Sastras, often discuss and describe the principles of Hindu temple design, but do not limit themselves to the design of a Hindu temple.[30] They describe the temple as a holistic part of its community, and lay out various principles and a diversity of alternate designs for home, village and city layout along with the temple, gardens, water bodies and nature.[13][31]\\r\\nThe central area in all mandala is the Brahmasthana. Mandala \\"circle-circumference\\" or \\"completion\\", is a concentric diagram having spiritual and ritual significance in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The space occupied by it varies in different mandala ÿ in Pitha (9) and Upapitha (25) it occupies one square module, in Mahaapitha (16), Ugrapitha (36) and Manduka (64), four square modules and in Sthandila (49) and Paramasaayika (81), nine square modules.[32] The Pitha is an amplified Prithvimandala in which, according to some texts, the central space is occupied by earth. The Sthandila mandala is used in a concentric manner.[32]\\r\\nThe most important mandala is the Manduka/ Chandita Mandala of 64 squares and the Paramasaayika Mandala of 81 squares. The normal position of the Vastu Purusha (head in the northeast, legs in the southwest) is as depicted in the Paramasaayika Mandala. However, in the Manduka Mandala the Vastu Purusha is depicted with the head facing east and the feet facing west.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is believed that every piece of a land or a building has a soul of its own and that soul is known as Vastu Purusha.[33]\\r\\nA site of any shape can be divided using the Pada Vinyasa. Sites are known by the number of squares. They range from 1x1 to 32x32 (1024) square sites. Examples of mandalas with the corresponding names of sites include:[8]\\r\\nVastu sastra represents a body of ancient concepts and knowledge to many modern architects, a guideline but not a rigid code.[9][35] The square-grid mandala is viewed as a model of organization, not as a ground plan. The ancient Vastu sastra texts describe functional relations and adaptable alternate layouts for various rooms or buildings and utilities, but do not mandate a set compulsory architecture. Sachdev and Tillotson state that the mandala is a guideline, and employing the mandala concept of Vastu sastra does not mean every room or building has to be square.[9] The basic theme is around core elements of central space, peripheral zones, direction with respect to sunlight, and relative functions of the spaces.[9][35]\\r\\nThe pink city Jaipur in Rajasthan was master planned by Rajput king Jai Singh and built by 1727 CE, in part around Vastu Shilpa Sastra principles.[9][36][36] Similarly, modern era projects such as the architect Charles Correa's designed Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya in Ahmedabad, Vidhan Bhavan in Bhopal,[37] and Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur, adapt and apply concepts from the Vastu Shastra Vidya.[9][35] In the design of Chandigarh city, Le Corbusier incorporated modern architecture theories with those of Vastu Shastra.[38][39][40]\\r\\nDuring the colonial rule period of India, town planning officials of the British Raj did not consider Vastu Vidya, but largely grafted Islamic Mughal era motifs and designs such as domes and arches onto Victorian-era style buildings without overall relationship layout.[41][42] This movement, later known as the Indo-Saracenic style, is found in chaotically laid out, but externally grand structures in the form of currently used major railway stations, harbors, tax collection buildings, and other colonial offices in South Asia.[41]\\r\\nVastu sastra vidya was ignored, during colonial era construction, for several reasons. These texts were viewed by 19th and early 20th century architects as archaic, the literature was inaccessible being in an ancient language not spoken or read by the architects, and the ancient texts assumed space to be readily available.[35][41] In contrast, public projects in the colonial era were forced into crowded spaces and local layout constraints, and the ancient Vastu sastra were viewed with prejudice as superstitious and rigid about a square grid or traditional materials of construction.[41] Sachdev and Tillotson state that these prejudices were flawed, as a scholarly and complete reading of the Vastu sastra literature amply suggests the architect is free to adapt the ideas to new materials of construction, local layout constraints and into a non-square space.[41][43] The design and completion of a new city of Jaipur in early 1700s based on Vastu sastra texts, well before any colonial era public projects, was one of many proofs.[41][43] Other examples include modern public projects designed by Charles Correa such as Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur, and Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad.[9][34] Vastu Shastra remedies have also been applied by Khushdeep Bansal in 1997 to the Parliament complex of India, when he contented that the library being built next to the building is responsible for political instability in the country.[44]\\r\\nKlaus-Peter Gast states that the principles of Vastu Shastras is witnessing a major revival and wide usage in the planning and design of individual homes, residential complexes, commercial and industrial campuses, and major public projects in India, along with the use of ancient iconography and mythological art work incorporated into the Vastu vidya architectures.[34][45]\\r\\nThe use of Vastu shastra and Vastu consultants in modern home and public projects is controversial.[43] Some architects, particularly during India's colonial era, considered it arcane and superstitious.[35][41] Other architects state that critics have not read the texts and that most of the text is about flexible design guidelines for space, sunlight, flow and function.[35][45]\\r\\nVastu Shastra is considered as pseudoscience by rationalists like Narendra Nayak of Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations.[46] Scientist and astronomer Jayant Narlikar considers Vastu Shastra as pseudoscience and writes that Vastu does not have any \\"logical connection\\" to the environment.[4] One of the examples cited by Narlikar arguing the absence of logical connection is the Vastu rule, \\"sites shaped like a triangle ... will lead to government harassment, ... parallelogram can lead to quarrels in the family.\\" Narlikar notes that sometimes the building plans are changed and what has already been built is demolished to accommodate for Vastu rules.[4] Regarding superstitious beliefs in Vastu, Science writer Meera Nanda cites the case of N.T.Rama Rao, the ex-chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, who sought the help of Vastu consultants for his political problems. Rama Rao was advised that his problems would be solved if he entered his office from an east facing gate. Accordingly, a slum on the east facing side of his office was ordered to be demolished, to make way for his car's entrance.[47][48] The knowledge of Vastu consultants is questioned by Pramod Kumar, \\"Ask the Vaastu folks if they know civil engineering or architecture or the local government rules on construction or minimum standards of construction to advise people on buildings. They will get into a barrage of \\"ancient\\" texts and \\"science\\" that smack of the pseudo-science of astrology. Ask them where they were before the construction boom and if they will go to slum tenements to advise people or advise on low-cost community-housingyou draw a blank.\\"[49]\\r\\nOf the numerous Sanskrit treatises mentioned in ancient Indian literature, some have been translated in English. Many Agamas, Puranas and Hindu scriptures include chapters on architecture of temples, homes, villages, towns, fortifications, streets, shop layout, public wells, public bathing, public halls, gardens, river fronts among other things.[6] In some cases, the manuscripts are partially lost, some are available only in Tibetan, Nepalese or South Indian languages, while in others original Sanskrit manuscripts are available in different parts of India.

He can only be stopped by force, and we and France are today, in fulfilment of our obligations, going to the aid of Poland, who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people.

Seventy delegates from 27 nations participated in the negotiations. The opposing nations of the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were excluded from the negotiations. At first a \\"Council of Ten\\" comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Japan met officially to decide the peace terms. It became the \\"Big Four\\" when Japan dropped out and the top person from each of the other four nations met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions to be ratified by the entire assembly. In June 1919, the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves. The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position, and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty. Gustav Bauer, the head of the new government, sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn, including articles 227, 230 and 231. In response, the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within 24 hours. On 23 June 1919, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty.\\r\\nOn 28 June 1919, Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, a peace treaty which ended the formal state of war and imposed various punitive measures upon Germany, including military restriction, loss of territory and colonies, war debt, and effective acceptance of blame for the initiation of hostilities in World War I. At the time of the armistice, an attempted Communist revolution transpired (October 1918-August 1919), resulting in the abdication of the Emperor of Germany in November 1918, and what became known as the Weimar Republic was subsequently established in the wake of the uprising. The transition from monarchy to republic was difficult, and many in the new government were not supportive of the democratic system of government. The officer class gave little support to the Republic, and Germany was forced to borrow money from the United States and others to pay its war debt, imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. In the early 1920s a period of hyperinflation made the Reichsmark almost worthless. In January 1922, one US dollar was worth 191 Marks, but by November of the same year it was equal to 4,200,000,000 Marks.[2]\\r\\nIn 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of the Reich following a contentious election. Under Hitler's leadership, the Reichstag turned the government into an effective dictatorship under Hitler's oversight on 21 March 1933 with the passage of the Enabling Act of 1933, and the economic hardships were significantly diminished via implementation of new economic and social policies. After five years in power, Hitler annexed Austria, former component of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (allies of the former German Empire), into Germany, despite such an act (specifically, \\"prohibition on the merging of Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations\\") being banned by both the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Treaty of Versailles. In early November 1938, the First Vienna Award was signed, allowing Germany to seize the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia which had been a part of the German Empire-allied Austro-Hungarian Empire. Soon after, Germany invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia and also gained Memelland (part of the former German Empire from 1871-1920) through the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania.\\r\\nWhile some sources claim Hitler still wanted more, to create Lebensraum, or \\"living space\\", for Germany, other sources claim evidence of hostility on behalf of Polish partisans toward ethnic Germans in the Danzig Corridor (territory lost to Germany as a result of the Treaty of Versailles) which may have served as a motivating factor for the German invasion (often portrayed as propaganda to justify German expansionism).\\r\\nTwo Western powers, the United Kingdom and France, gave guarantees to Poland that they would declare war if Polish independence came under threat, as presented in a statement to the House of Commons by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 31 March 1939 (formalized by the British 6 April 1939; not ratified until 4 September 1939 by the French):\\r\\n... in the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence, and which the Polish Government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty's Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Polish Government all support in their power. They have given the Polish Government an assurance to this effect.\\r\\nI may add that the French Government have authorised me to make it plain that they stand in the same position in this matter as do His Majesty's Government.[3]\\r\\nAlthough they honoured these guarantees by declaring war soon after Germany's Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939,[4] and although the dominions of the British Empire quickly followed suit, so little practical assistance was given to Poland, which was soon defeated, that in its early stages the war declared by Britain and France was described as a \\"Phoney War\\".\\r\\nFurther, neither the British Empire, nor the French, ever declared war upon the Soviet Union, which invaded Poland on 17 September 1939 (17 days after Nazi Germany invaded from the West) and held sway over the former-Polish territory at the war's conclusion, having become a part of the Allied front in the course of World War II. At the insistence of Joseph Stalin, the post-war Yalta Conference in 1945 sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the Polish government-in-exile based in London.\\r\\nThe following excerpts of the speech were sampled by the drum and bass artist S.P.Y. in his remix of Black Sun Empire's track \\"Potemkin\\":[5]\\r\\n- \\"that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us\\"\\r\\n- \\"I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany\\",","input":"When did france and great britain declare war on germany?"},{"output":"the state of New York","context":"","input":"What's the state of new york city?"},{"output":"Brian Dunkleman","context":"Brian Dunkleman (born September 25, 1971) is an American comedian, actor and television personality.

A cell is the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently, and cells are often called the \\"building blocks of life\\". The study of cells is called cell biology.\\r\\nCells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.[2] Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell; including bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals).[3] While the number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species, humans contain more than 10 trillion (1013) cells.[4] Most plant and animal cells are visible only under a microscope, with dimensions between 1 and 100?micrometres.[5]\\r\\nThe cell was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, who named the biological units for their resemblance to cells inhabited by Christian monks in a monastery.[6][7] Cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms, that all cells come from preexisting cells, and that all cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells.[8] Cells emerged on Earth at least 3.5 billion years ago.[9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCells are of two types, eukaryotic, which contain a nucleus, and prokaryotic, which do not. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms, while eukaryotes can be either single-celled or multicellular.\\r\\nProkaryotic cells were the first form of life on Earth, characterised by having vital biological processes including cell signaling and being self-sustaining. They are simpler and smaller than eukaryotic cells, and lack membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus. Prokaryotes include two of the domains of life, bacteria and archaea. The DNA of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single chromosome that is in direct contact with the cytoplasm. The nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes are the smallest of all organisms ranging from 0.5 to 2.0?m in diameter.[13]\\r\\nA prokaryotic cell has three architectural regions:\\r\\nPlants, animals, fungi, slime moulds, protozoa, and algae are all eukaryotic. These cells are about fifteen times wider than a typical prokaryote and can be as much as a thousand times greater in volume. The main distinguishing feature of eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes is compartmentalization: the presence of membrane-bound organelles (compartments) in which specific metabolic activities take place. Most important among these is a cell nucleus,[3] an organelle that houses the cell's DNA. This nucleus gives the eukaryote its name, which means \\"true kernel (nucleus)\\". Other differences include:\\r\\nAll cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a membrane that envelops the cell, regulates what moves in and out (selectively permeable), and maintains the electric potential of the cell. Inside the membrane, the cytoplasm takes up most of the cell's volume. All cells (except red blood cells which lack a cell nucleus and most organelles to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin) possess DNA, the hereditary material of genes, and RNA, containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells. This article lists these primary components of the cell, then briefly describes their function.\\r\\nThe cell membrane, or plasma membrane, is a biological membrane that surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell. In animals, the plasma membrane is the outer boundary of the cell, while in plants and prokaryotes it is usually covered by a cell wall. This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a double layer of phospholipids, which are amphiphilic (partly hydrophobic and partly hydrophilic). Hence, the layer is called a phospholipid bilayer, or sometimes a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a variety of protein molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell.[3] The membrane is said to be 'semi-permeable', in that it can either let a substance (molecule or ion) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain receptor proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as hormones.\\r\\nThe cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during endocytosis, the uptake of external materials by a cell, and cytokinesis, the separation of daughter cells after cell division; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules. There are a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments.[3] The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, polarity and cytokinesis.[18] The subunit protein of microfilaments is a small, monomeric protein called actin. The subunit of microtubules is a dimeric molecule called tubulin. Intermediate filaments are heteropolymers whose subunits vary among the cell types in different tissues. But some of the subunit protein of intermediate filaments include vimentin, desmin, lamin (lamins A, B and C), keratin (multiple acidic and basic keratins), neurofilament proteins (NFÿL, NFÿM).\\r\\nTwo different kinds of genetic material exist: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA sequence.[3] RNA is used for information transport (e.g., mRNA) and enzymatic functions (e.g., ribosomal RNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein translation.\\r\\nProkaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple circular DNA molecule (the bacterial chromosome) in the nucleoid region of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different,[3] linear molecules called chromosomes inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts (see endosymbiotic theory).\\r\\nA human cell has genetic material contained in the cell nucleus (the nuclear genome) and in the mitochondria (the mitochondrial genome). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called chromosomes, including 22 homologous chromosome pairs and a pair of sex chromosomes. The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from the nuclear DNA. Although the mitochondrial DNA is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes,[3] it codes for 13 proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production and specific tRNAs.\\r\\nForeign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called transfection. This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell's genome, or stable, if it is. Certain viruses also insert their genetic material into the genome.\\r\\nOrganelles are parts of the cell which are adapted and/or specialized for carrying out one or more vital functions, analogous to the organs of the human body (such as the heart, lung, and kidney, with each organ performing a different function).[3] Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have organelles, but prokaryotic organelles are generally simpler and are not membrane-bound.\\r\\nThere are several types of organelles in a cell. Some (such as the nucleus and golgi apparatus) are typically solitary, while others (such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, peroxisomes and lysosomes) can be numerous (hundreds to thousands). The cytosol is the gelatinous fluid that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles.\\r\\nMany cells also have structures which exist wholly or partially outside the cell membrane. These structures are notable because they are not protected from the external environment by the semipermeable cell membrane. In order to assemble these structures, their components must be carried across the cell membrane by export processes.\\r\\nMany types of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have a cell wall. The cell wall acts to protect the cell mechanically and chemically from its environment, and is an additional layer of protection to the cell membrane. Different types of cell have cell walls made up of different materials; plant cell walls are primarily made up of cellulose, fungi cell walls are made up of chitin and bacteria cell walls are made up of peptidoglycan.\\r\\nA gelatinous capsule is present in some bacteria outside the cell membrane and cell wall. The capsule may be polysaccharide as in pneumococci, meningococci or polypeptide as Bacillus anthracis or hyaluronic acid as in streptococci. Capsules are not marked by normal staining protocols and can be detected by India ink or methyl blue; which allows for higher contrast between the cells for observation.[20]:87\\r\\nFlagella are organelles for cellular mobility. The bacterial flagellum stretches from cytoplasm through the cell membrane(s) and extrudes through the cell wall. They are long and thick thread-like appendages, protein in nature. A different type of flagellum is found in archaea and a different type is found in eukaryotes.\\r\\nA fimbria also known as a pilus is a short, thin, hair-like filament found on the surface of bacteria. Fimbriae, or pili are formed of a protein called pilin (antigenic) and are responsible for attachment of bacteria to specific receptors of human cell (cell adhesion). There are special types of specific pili involved in bacterial conjugation.\\r\\nBetween successive cell divisions, cells grow through the functioning of cellular metabolism. Cell metabolism is the process by which individual cells process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: catabolism, in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and reducing power, and anabolism, in which the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions. Complex sugars consumed by the organism can be broken down into simpler sugar molecules called monosaccharides such as glucose. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP),[3] a molecule that possesses readily available energy, through two different pathways.\\r\\nCell division involves a single cell (called a mother cell) dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in multicellular organisms (the growth of tissue) and to procreation (vegetative reproduction) in unicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission, while eukaryotic cells usually undergo a process of nuclear division, called mitosis, followed by division of the cell, called cytokinesis. A diploid cell may also undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells, usually four. Haploid cells serve as gametes in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells.\\r\\nDNA replication, or the process of duplicating a cell's genome,[3] always happens when a cell divides through mitosis or binary fission. This occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle.\\r\\nIn meiosis, the DNA is replicated only once, while the cell divides twice. DNA replication only occurs before meiosis I. DNA replication does not occur when the cells divide the second time, in meiosis II.[21] Replication, like all cellular activities, requires specialized proteins for carrying out the job.[3]\\r\\nCells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.\\r\\nTranscription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give messenger RNA (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called ribosomes located in the cytosol, where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to transfer RNA (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule.\\r\\nUnicellular organisms can move in order to find food or escape predators. Common mechanisms of motion include flagella and cilia.\\r\\nIn multicellular organisms, cells can move during processes such as wound healing, the immune response and cancer metastasis. For example, in wound healing in animals, white blood cells move to the wound site to kill the microorganisms that cause infection. Cell motility involves many receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor and other proteins.[22] The process is divided into three steps ÿ protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, adhesion of the leading edge and de-adhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal contraction to pull the cell forward. Each step is driven by physical forces generated by unique segments of the cytoskeleton.[23][24]\\r\\nMulticellular organisms are organisms that consist of more than one cell, in contrast to single-celled organisms.[25]\\r\\nIn complex multicellular organisms, cells specialize into different cell types that are adapted to particular functions. In mammals, major cell types include skin cells, muscle cells, neurons, blood cells, fibroblasts, stem cells, and others. Cell types differ both in appearance and function, yet are genetically identical. Cells are able to be of the same genotype but of different cell type due to the differential expression of the genes they contain.\\r\\nMost distinct cell types arise from a single totipotent cell, called a zygote, that differentiates into hundreds of different cell types during the course of development. Differentiation of cells is driven by different environmental cues (such as cellÿcell interaction) and intrinsic differences (such as those caused by the uneven distribution of molecules during division).\\r\\nMulticellularity has evolved independently at least 25 times,[26] including in some prokaryotes, like cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, actinomycetes, Magnetoglobus multicellularis or Methanosarcina. However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, fungi, brown algae, red algae, green algae, and plants.[27] It evolved repeatedly for plants (Chloroplastida), once or twice for animals, once for brown algae, and perhaps several times for fungi, slime molds, and red algae.[28] Multicellularity may have evolved from colonies of interdependent organisms, from cellularization, or from organisms in symbiotic relationships.\\r\\nThe first evidence of multicellularity is from cyanobacteria-like organisms that lived between 3 and 3.5 billion years ago.[26] Other early fossils of multicellular organisms include the contested Grypania spiralis and the fossils of the black shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian Group Fossil B Formation in Gabon.[29]\\r\\nThe evolution of multicellularity from unicellular ancestors has been replicated in the laboratory, in evolution experiments using predation as the selective pressure.[26]\\r\\nThe origin of cells has to do with the origin of life, which began the history of life on Earth.\\r\\nThere are several theories about the origin of small molecules that led to life on the early Earth. They may have been carried to Earth on meteorites (see Murchison meteorite), created at deep-sea vents, or synthesized by lightning in a reducing atmosphere (see MillerÿUrey experiment). There is little experimental data defining what the first self-replicating forms were. RNA is thought to be the earliest self-replicating molecule, as it is capable of both storing genetic information and catalyzing chemical reactions (see RNA world hypothesis), but some other entity with the potential to self-replicate could have preceded RNA, such as clay or peptide nucleic acid.[30]\\r\\nCells emerged at least 3.5 billion years ago.[9][10][11] The current belief is that these cells were heterotrophs. The early cell membranes were probably more simple and permeable than modern ones, with only a single fatty acid chain per lipid. Lipids are known to spontaneously form bilayered vesicles in water, and could have preceded RNA, but the first cell membranes could also have been produced by catalytic RNA, or even have required structural proteins before they could form.[31]\\r\\nThe eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a symbiotic community of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like the mitochondria and the chloroplasts are descended from ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, respectively, which were endosymbiosed by an ancestral archaean prokaryote.\\r\\nThere is still considerable debate about whether organelles like the hydrogenosome predated the origin of mitochondria, or vice versa: see the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotic cells.","input":"What type of bacteria preceded the eukaryotic cell?"},{"output":"74 card sets released in America","context":"","input":"How many sets of pokemon cards are there?"},{"output":"August 21, 2017","context":"The solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, dubbed \\"The Great American Eclipse\\" by the media,[1][2][3][4][5] was a total solar eclipse visible within a band across the entire contiguous United States, passing from the Pacific to the Atlantic coasts. As a partial solar eclipse, it was visible on land from Nunavut in northern Canada to as far south as northern South America. In northwestern Europe and Africa, it was partially visible in the late evening. In Asia, it was visible only at the eastern extremity, the Chukchi Peninsula.\\r\\nPrior to this event, no solar eclipse had been visible across the entire contiguous United States since June 8, 1918; not since the February 1979 eclipse had a total eclipse been visible from anywhere in the mainland United States.[6] The path of totality touched 14 states, and the rest of the U.S. had a partial eclipse.[6] The area of the path of totality was about 16 percent of the area of the United States,[7] with most of this area over the ocean, not land. The event's shadow began to cover land on the Oregon coast as a partial eclipse at 4:05?p.m. UTC (9:05?a.m. PDT), with the total eclipse beginning there at 5:16?p.m. UTC (10:16?a.m. PDT); the total eclipse's land coverage ended along the South Carolina coast at about 6:44?p.m. UTC (2:44?p.m. EDT).[6] Visibility as a partial eclipse in Honolulu, Hawaii began with sunrise at 4:20?p.m. UTC (6:20?a.m. HST) and ended by 5:25?p.m. UTC (7:25?a.m. HST).[8]\\r\\nThis total solar eclipse marked the first such event in the smartphone and social media era in America. Information, personal communication, and photography were widely available as never before, capturing popular attention and enhancing the social experience.\\r\\nMarriage proposals took place coinciding with the eclipse, and at least one wedding was also planned and took place to coincide with the eclipse.[9][10] Logistical problems were expected with the influx of visitors, especially for smaller communities.[11] The sale of counterfeit eclipse glasses was also anticipated to be a hazard for eye injuries.[12]\\r\\nFuture total solar eclipses will cross the United States in April 2024 (12 states) and August 2045 (10 states), and annular solar eclipseswherein the Moon appears smaller than the Sunwill occur in October 2023 (9 states) and June 2048 (9 states).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total eclipse had a magnitude of 1.0306 and was visible within a narrow corridor 70 miles (110?km) wide, crossing fourteen of the contiguous United States: Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.[13][14] It was first seen from land in the U.S. shortly after 10:15?a.m. PDT (17:15?UTC) at Oregon's Pacific coast, and then it progressed eastward through Salem, Oregon; Idaho Falls, Idaho; Casper, Wyoming; Lincoln, Nebraska; Kansas City, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; Hopkinsville, Kentucky; Nashville, Tennessee; Columbia, South Carolina about 2:41?p.m.;[15] and finally Charleston, South Carolina. A partial eclipse was seen for a greater time period, beginning shortly after 9:00?a.m. PDT along the Pacific Coast of Oregon. Weather forecasts predicted clear skies in Western U.S. and some Eastern states, but clouds in the Midwest and East Coast.[16]\\r\\nThe longest ground duration of totality was 2 minutes 41.6 seconds at about 37350N 8970W? / ?37.58333N 89.11667W? / 37.58333; -89.11667 in Giant City State Park, just south of Carbondale, Illinois, and the greatest extent (width) was at 36580N 874018W? / ?36.96667N 87.67167W? / 36.96667; -87.67167 near the village of Cerulean, Kentucky, located in between Hopkinsville and Princeton.[17] This was the first total solar eclipse visible from the Southeastern United States since the solar eclipse of March 7, 1970. Two NASA WB-57F flew above the clouds, prolonging the observation time spent in the umbra.[18] A partial solar eclipse was seen from the much broader path of the Moon's penumbra, including all of North America, particularly areas just south of the totality pass, where the eclipse lasted about 3ÿ5 hours, northern South America, Western Europe, and some of Africa and north-east Asia.\\r\\nAt one location in Wyoming, a small group of astronomers used telescopic lenses to photograph the sun as it was in partial eclipse, while the ISS was also seen to briefly transit the sun.[19]\\r\\nDuring the eclipse for a long span of its path of totality, several bright stars and four planets were visible. The star-system Regulus was visible slightly to the west of the Sun. Mars was 8 degrees to the right, and Venus 34 degrees right. Mercury was 10 degrees left, and Jupiter 51 degrees left.[20]\\r\\nThis was the first total solar eclipse visible from the United States since that of July 11, 1991[21]which was seen only from part of Hawaii[22]and the first visible from the contiguous United States since 1979.[23] An eclipse of comparable length (up to 3 minutes, 8 seconds, with the longest eclipse being 6 minutes and 54 seconds) occurred over the contiguous United States on March 7, 1970 along the southern portions of the Eastern Seaboard, from Florida to Virginia.[24]\\r\\nThe path of totality of the solar eclipse of February 26, 1979 crossed only the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and North Dakota. Many enthusiasts traveled to the Pacific Northwest to view the eclipse, since it would be the last chance to view such an eclipse in the contiguous United States for almost four decades.[25][26]\\r\\nSome American scientists and interested amateurs who wanted to experience a total eclipse participated in a four-day Atlantic Ocean cruise to view the solar eclipse of July 10, 1972 as it passed near Nova Scotia. (This is referenced in the Carly Simon hit song \\"You're So Vain\\" in the lyric, \\"Then you flew your Lear Jet up to Nova Scotia to see the total eclipse of the Sun.\\") Organizers of the cruise advertised in astronomical journals and in planetarium announcements, emphasizing the rarity of the event.[27]\\r\\nThe August 2017 eclipse was the first with a path of totality crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the U.S. since 1918. Also, its path of totality made landfall exclusively within the United States, making it the first such eclipse since the country's declaration of independence in 1776. Prior to this, the path of totality of the eclipse of June 13, 1257, was the last to make landfall exclusively on lands currently part of the United States.[28]\\r\\nThe path of the 2017 eclipse crosses with the path of the upcoming total solar eclipse of April 8, 2024, with the intersection of the two paths being in southern Illinois in Makanda Township at Cedar Lake, just south of Carbondale. An area of about 9,000 square miles, including the cities of Makanda, Carbondale, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Paducah, Kentucky, will thus experience two total solar eclipses within a span of less than seven years.[citation needed] The cities of Benton, Carbondale, Chester, Harrisburg, Marion, and Metropolis in Illinois; Cape Girardeau, Farmington, and Perryville in Missouri, as well as Paducah, Kentucky, will also be in the path of the 2024 eclipse, thereby earning the distinction of witnessing two total solar eclipses in seven years.\\r\\nThe solar eclipse of August 12, 2045 will have a very similar path of totality over the U.S. to the 2017 eclipse: about 400?km (250?mi) to the southwest, also crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the country; however, totality will be more than twice as long.[29]\\r\\nA partial eclipse was visible across the width of Canada, ranging from 89 percent in Victoria, British Columbia to 11 percent in Resolute, Nunavut.[87] In Ottawa, viewing parties were held at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum.[88] In Toronto, viewing parties were held at the CNE and the Ontario Science Centre[89]\\r\\nA partial eclipse was visible from Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean islands, and ships and aircraft in and above the adjacent oceans,[90] as well as the northern countries of South America such as Colombia, Venezuela, and several others.[citation needed]\\r\\nA partial eclipse was visible only in the Chukchi Peninsula.[91] In Anadyr, the maximum obscuration was 27.82%.[92]\\r\\nIn northwestern Europe, a partial eclipse was visible in the evening or at sunset. Only those in Iceland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and the Portuguese Azores archipelago saw the eclipse from beginning to end; in the rest of the UK, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, and Portugal, sunset occurred before the end of the eclipse. In Germany, the beginning of the eclipse was visible just at sunset only in the extreme northwest of the country. In all regions east of the orange line on the map, the eclipse was not visible.[93]\\r\\nIn some locations in West Africa and western North Africa, a partial eclipse was seen just before and during sunset.[citation needed]\\r\\nA large number of media outlets broadcast coverage of the eclipse, including television and internet outlets. NASA announced plans to offer streaming coverage through its NASA TV and NASA Edge outlets, using cameras stationed on the ground along the path of totality, along with cameras on high-altitude balloons, jets, and coverage from the International Space Station; NASA stated that \\"never before will a celestial event be viewed by so many and explored from so many vantage pointsfrom space, from the air, and from the ground.\\"[94] ABC, CBS, and NBC announced that they would respectively broadcast live television specials to cover the eclipse with correspondents stationed across the path of totality, along with CNN, Fox News Channel, Science, and The Weather Channel. The PBS series Nova presented streaming coverage on Facebook hosted by Miles O'Brien, and aired a special episode chronicling the event\\"Eclipse Over America\\"later in the day (which marked the fastest production turnaround time in Nova history).[95][96]\\r\\nOther institutions and services also announced plans to stream their perspectives of the eclipse, including the Exploratorium in San Francisco, the Elephant Sanctuary of Hohenwald, Tennessee, the Slooh robotic telescope app, and The Virtual Telescope Project. The Eclipse Ballooning Project, a consortium of schools and colleges that sent 50 high-altitude balloons into the sky during the eclipse to conduct experiments, provided streams of footage and GPS tracking of its launches.[94][97] Contact with one balloon with $13,000 of scientific equipment, launched under the aegis of the LGF Museum of Natural History near Vale, Oregon, was lost at 20,000 feet (6,100?m). Given that the balloon was believed to have burst at 100,000 feet (30,000?m), it could have parachuted down anywhere from eastern Oregon to Caldwell, Idaho (most likely) to Sun Valley, Idaho; a $1,000 reward is offered for its recovery.[98]\\r\\nThe National Solar Observatory organized Citizen CATE volunteers to man 60 identical telescopes and instrumentation packages along the totality path to study changes in the corona over the duration of the eclipse.\\r\\nIn orbit, the satellites Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the International Space Station, the Solar Dynamics Observatory, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, and Hinode gathered data from the eclipse.[99]\\r\\nA viewing party was held at the White House, during which President Donald Trump appeared on the Truman Balcony with First Lady Melania Trump. With the sun partially eclipsed, President Trump looked briefly in the general direction of the sun before using solar viewing glasses.[100]\\r\\nThe rapper Joey Badass boasted of watching the solar eclipse without viewing glasses, considering that \\"our ancestors ain't have no fancy eyewear [and] they ain't all go blind\\". Unlike the US president, he did not wear viewing glasses during the entire eclipse. Later, he complained of vision problems and had to cancel his Cleveland, Chicago & Toronto shows on the Everybody Tour, due to \\"unforeseen circumstances\\".[101]\\r\\nThe eclipse generated reports of abnormal behavior in animal and plant life. Some farm animals including domestic chickens came out from under their coops and began grooming, usually an evening activity. Horses also displayed increased whinnying, running, and jumping after the event. Cicadas were reported to grow louder before going silent during totality. Various birds were also observed flying in unusually large formations. Flowers such as the Hibiscus closed their petals which typically happens at night, before opening again after the solar event.[102]\\r\\nNASA reported over 90 million page views of the eclipse on its websites, making it the agency's biggest online event ever, beating the previous web traffic record about seven times over.[103]\\r\\nIn the months leading up to the eclipse, many counterfeit glasses were put up for sale. Effective eclipse glasses must not only block most visible light, but most UV and infrared light as well. For visible light, the user should only be able to see the Sun, sunglint reflected off shiny metal, halogen bulbs, the filament in unfrosted incandescent bulbs, and similarly intense sources. Determining whether the glasses effectively block enough UV and infrared light requires the use of spectrophotometer, which is a rather expensive piece of lab equipment.[12][104]\\r\\nThe eye's retina lacks pain receptors, and thus damage can occur without one's awareness.[105][106]\\r\\nThe American Astronomical Society (AAS) said products meeting the ISO 12312-2 standard avoid risk to one's eyes, and issued a list of reputable vendors of eclipse glasses. The organization warned against products claiming ISO certification or even citing the same number, but not tested by an accredited laboratory. Another problem was counterfeits of reputable vendors' products, some even claiming the company's name such as with American Paper Optics which published information detailing the differences between its glasses and counterfeits.[107][105]\\r\\nAndrew Lund, the owner of a company which produces eclipse glasses, noted that not all counterfeit glasses were necessarily unsafe. He stated to Quartz that the counterfeits he tested blocked the majority of harmful light spectrum, concluding that \\"the IP is getting ripped off, but the good news is there are no long-term harmful effects.\\"[104] As one example, the Springdale Library in metropolitan Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, accidentally passed out dozens of pairs of counterfeit eclipse glasses, but as of August 23 had not received any reports of eye damage.[108]\\r\\nOn July 27, 2017, Amazon required all eclipse viewing products sold on its website have a submission of origin and safety information, and proof of an accredited ISO certification. In mid-August 2017, Amazon recalled and pulled listings for eclipse viewing glasses that \\"may not comply with industry standards\\", and gave refunds to customers who had purchased them.[109][12]\\r\\nShort-term damage includes solar keratitis, which is similar to sunburn of the cornea. Symptoms usually occur within twenty-four hours and include eye pain and light sensitivity.[110]\\r\\nLong-term or permanent damage includes solar retinopathy, which occurs when the sun burns a hole in the retina, usually at the fovea (the focus of the retina). Symptoms can occur as long as several weeks after the incident, and can include loss of central vision and/or other vision, as well as eye pain and light sensitivity, afterimages, and changes in color vision.[111]\\r\\nDepending on the severity of damage, vision problems can last for several months or be permanent.[110]\\r\\nDr. Avnish Deobhakta, an ophthalmologist in New York, states that, \\"If youre looking at the sun youre actually focusing, intentionally, the light of the sun onto the spot [fovea] where you want the most precise vision.[112]\\r\\nFollowing a total eclipse in the United Kingdom in 1999, at least 14 cases of permanent damage were confirmed.[113]\\r\\nOne story of solar eclipse danger was illustrated by the case of Mr. Tomososki, who damaged his eyesight when viewing a 1962 eclipse, leaving him with a pea-sized blind spot for the rest of his life.[114] During the 2017 eclipse he warned the country to not make the mistake he did.[114] While some can recover, the danger of an eclipse comes in part because the excitement can override the instinct to not look at the sun.[115]\\r\\nOfficials inside and near the path of totality planned?ÿ sometimes for years?ÿ for the sudden influx of people.[116] Smaller towns struggled to arrange viewing sites and logistics for what could have been a tourism boom or a disaster.[117]\\r\\nIn the American West, illegal camping was a major concern, including near cities like Jackson Hole, Wyoming.[11] Idaho's Office of Emergency Management said Idaho was a prime viewing state, and advised jurisdictions to prepare for service load increases; nearly every hotel and motel room, campground, and in some cases backyards for nearly 100 miles (160?km) north and south of the path of totality had been reserved several months, if not years, in advance.[118] The state anticipated up to 500,000 visitors to join its 1.6?million residents.[119]\\r\\nOregon deployed six National Guard aircraft and 150 soldiers because the influx of visitors coincided with the state's fire season.[120] Hospital staffing, and supplies of blood and antiÿsnake bite antidote, were augmented along the totality line.[121]\\r\\nIn Oregon, there were reports of hoteliers canceling existing reservations made at the regular market rate and increasing their rate, sometimes threefold or more, for guests staying to view the eclipse.[122] The Oregon Department of Justice (DOJ) investigated various complaints and reached settlements with affected customers of at least 10 hotels in the state.[123] These settlements included refunds to the customers and fines paid to the DOJ.[124]\\r\\nAlthough traffic to areas within the path of totality was somewhat spread out over the days prior to the eclipse,[125] there were widespread traffic problems across the United States after the event ended. Michael Zeiler, an eclipse cartographer, had estimated that between 1.85?million and 7.4?million people would travel to the path of the eclipse.[126]\\r\\nIn Oregon, an estimated one million people were expected to arrive that the Oregon National Guard was called in to help manage traffic in Madras along US 26 and US 97.[127] Madras Municipal Airport received more than 400 mostly personal planes that queued for hours while waiting to leave after the eclipse.[128]\\r\\nOfficials in Idaho, where the totality path crossed the center of the state, began planning for the eclipse a year in advance. The state Transportation Department suspended construction projects along Interstate 15, which traverses Eastern Idaho, from August 18ÿ22 in order to have all lanes open;[129] their counterparts in neighboring Utah, where many were expected to travel the 220 miles (350?km) north via the highway from the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, did the same. On the morning of the eclipse, many drivers left before dawn, creating traffic volume along I-15 normally not seen until morning rush hour; northbound traffic on the interstate in Box Elder County north of Salt Lake City slowed to 10ÿ15 miles per hour (16ÿ24?km/h).[130] The Idaho State Police (ISP) stationed a patrol car along I-15 every 15 miles (24?km) between Shelley and the Utah border.[131]\\r\\nAfter the eclipse, traffic more than doubled along I-15 southbound, with extensive traffic jams continuing for eight hours as viewers who had traveled north into the totality path from Utah returned there and to points south. The ISP tweeted a picture of bumper-to-bumper traffic stalled on the interstate just south of Idaho Falls. Motorists reported to local news outlets that it was taking them two hours to travel the 47 miles (76?km) from that city to Pocatello to the south, a journey that normally takes 45 minutes.[130] Others reported that it took three hours to travel from Idaho Falls to the closer city of Blackfoot, 30 miles (48?km) farther north of Pocatello.[132]\\r\\nIn the rest of the state the impact was less severe. Traffic nearly doubled on US 93, and was up 55 percent on US 20.[133]\\r\\nFor some northbound travelers on I-15, the Montana Department of Transportation had failed to make similar plans to those in Idaho, scheduling a road construction project to begin on August 21 that narrowed a section of the highway to a single northbound lane, near the exit to Clark Canyon Dam south of Dillon. Though that stretch of highway generally has a traffic count of less than 1,000 vehicles per day, on the day of the eclipse there were over a thousand vehicles per hour at peak times. As a result, traffic backed up as far as Lima, creating a delay of at least an hour for travelers heading northward. Further, as construction had not yet begun, drivers observed cones set up but no workers present on the road. While the state traditionally halts construction projects during high traffic periods, a state official admitted \\"we ... probably made a bad mistake here in this regard.\\"[125]\\r\\nIn Wyoming, estimates were that the population of the state, officially 585,000, may have doubled or even tripled, with traffic counts on August 21 showing 536,000 more cars than the five-year average for the third Monday in August; a 68 percent increase. One official offered an estimate of \\"two people in every car\\" to arrive at a one-million-visitor figure, and others noted that one million was a conservative estimate based on a one-day traffic count of limited portions of major highways. There were additional arrivals by aircraft, plus travelers who arrived early or stayed for additional days.[134] Two days before the eclipse, traffic increased 18 percent over a five-year average, with an additional 131,000 vehicles on the road.[135] Sunday saw an additional 217,000-vehicle increase.[134]\\r\\nFollowing the eclipse, more than 500,000 vehicles traveled Wyoming roads, creating large traffic jams, particularly on southbound and eastbound highways.[136] Drivers reported that it took up to 10 hours to travel 160 miles (260?km) into northern Colorado.[134] There was one traffic fatality,[137] and another fatality related to an off-highway ATV accident, but in general there were far fewer incidents and traffic citations than authorities had anticipated.[138]\\r\\nIn Tennessee, the Knoxville News Sentinel described the traffic problems created by the eclipse as the worst ever seen in that part of the state. One backup along Interstate 75 reached 34 miles (55?km) in length, between Niota and the Interstate 40 interchange at Farragut. A spokesman for the state's Department of Transportation allowed that the traffic jams were the worst he had seen in six and a half years on the job, noting that accidents had aggravated the already heavy traffic flows, attributed the I-75 congestion to Knoxville-area residents heading for the totality path at Sweetwater and returning during what was the city's normal afternoon rush hour.[139]\\r\\nBefore the eclipse, state officials had described their traffic expectations as equivalent to that generated by the Bonnaroo Music Festival, the twice-a-season NASCAR Monster Energy Cup races at Bristol or the formerly-held Boomsday fireworks festival. \\"Maybe they should have considered a tsunami of traffic combining all three of those heavily attended events\\", the News Sentinel commented. The Tennessee Highway Patrol made sure that \\"[e]very trooper not on sick leave or military leave or pre-approved leave [wa]s working\\" the day of the eclipse; the state DOT made sure its full complement of emergency-aid HELP trucks were available as well. Alert signs on the highways also warned motorists not to pull over onto the shoulders to watch the eclipse as it could increase the risk of dangerous accidents and block the path of emergency vehicles.[139]\\r\\nIn North Carolina, the Department of Transportation added cameras, message boards and safety patrols in the counties where the total eclipse would take place, as well as stopping road work. The department warned that due to \\"unprecedented\\" traffic ordinary activities requiring driving might prove difficult, and advised people to act as if there were snow.[140]\\r\\nIn Kentucky, particularly around the Hopkinsville area, which was dubbed \\"Eclipseville, USA\\",[141] post-eclipse traffic caused extensive delays. The en masse departure of tourists via Interstate 69 as well as the Western Kentucky Parkway resulted in commute times double or even triple of normal.[142][143] The Hopkinsville-to-Lexington commute under normal circumstances lasts three and a half hours.\\r\\nAn eclipse causes a reduction of solar power generation where the Moon shadow covers any solar panel, as do clouds.\\r\\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corporation predicted minor impacts,[144] and attempted to measure the impact of the 2017 eclipse.[145] In California, solar power was projected to decrease by 4ÿ6,000 megawatts[146] at 70 MW/minute, and then ramp up by 90 MW/minute as the shadow passes. CAISO's typical ramp rate is 29 megawatts per minute.[147] Around 4 GW mainly in North Carolina and Georgia were expected to be 90 percent obscured.[146]\\r\\nAfter the 2017 eclipse, grid operators in California reported having lost 3,000ÿ3,500 megawatts of utility-scale solar power, which was made up for by hydropower and gas reliably and as expected,[148][149] mimicking the usual duck curve. Energy demand management was also used to mitigate the solar drop.[150]\\r\\nNV Energy prepared for the solar eclipse months in advance and collaborated with 17 western states. When the eclipse began covering California with partial darkness, which reduced its usual amount of solar-generated electricity, NV Energy sent power there. Likewise, when Nevada received less sunlight, other west coast states supplied electricity to it. During the solar eclipse, the state of Nevada lost about 450 megawatts of electricity, the amount used by about a quarter million typical residences.[151]\\r\\nThe 2015 eclipse caused manageable solar power decreases in Europe;[152] in Germany, solar power dropped from 14 GW to 7 GW, of a 38 GW solar power capacity.[153]\\r\\nOn June 20, 2017,[154] the United States Postal Service released the first application of thermochromic ink to postage stamps in its Total Eclipse of the Sun Forever stamp[155] to commemorate the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. When pressed with a finger, body heat turns the black circle in the center of the stamp into an image of the full moon. The stamp image is a photo of the solar eclipse of March 29, 2006 seen in Jalu, Libya. The photo was taken by retired NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak.[155]\\r\\nAnimation showing shadow movement of event from space.\\r\\nIllustration showing umbra (black oval), penumbra (concentric shaded ovals), and path of totality (red).\\r\\nIllustration featuring several visualizations of the event.\\r\\nShort time-lapse showing umbra as it moves across the clouds.\\r\\nVideo of the moment totality occurred in Newberry, South Carolina\\r\\n(Images where the sun is completely eclipsed by the moon)\\r\\nSequence starting at 9:06am, totality at 10:19am, and ending at 10:21am PDT, as seen from Corvallis, Oregon\\r\\nTotality and prominences as seen from Glenrock, Wyoming\\r\\nTotality as seen from Columbia, Missouri\\r\\nTotality as seen from Sweetwater, Tennessee\\r\\nTotality as seen from Saint Paul, Clarendon County, South Carolina\\r\\nTotality as seen from Newberry, South Carolina\\r\\n(Images showing Baily's beads or a Diamond ring, which occur just as totality begins or ends)\\r\\nBeginning of Diamond ring as seen from Glenrock, Wyoming\\r\\nDiamond ring as seen from Jay Em, Wyoming\\r\\nBaily's beads before totality from far western Nebraska\\r\\nDiamond ring as seen from Corvallis, Oregon\\r\\nDiamond ring as seen from Saint Paul, South Carolina\\r\\nDiamond ring as seen from Newberry, South Carolina\\r\\nDiamond ring (with large flare) as seen from Cullowhee, NC\\r\\n(Images where the sun is partially eclipsed by the moon)\\r\\nSeattle, Washington\\r\\nNorth Cascades National Park, Washington\\r\\nSan Francisco, California\\r\\nMira Mesa in San Diego, California\\r\\nFar western Nebraska\\r\\nWhite House, Tennessee\\r\\nMaine at 2:41?p.m. EDT before maximum 68% coverage at 2:45?p.m.\\r\\nBrooklyn, New York\\r\\nEllicott City, Maryland shortly before maximum eclipse (~80%)\\r\\nVirginia Beach, Virginia\\r\\nSimpsonville, South Carolina\\r\\nNewberry, South Carolina\\r\\n(Images of the eclipse created by natural pinholes formed by tree leaves)\\r\\nNorth Cascade mountains (British Columbia and Washington).\\r\\nMoon, Pennsylvania\\r\\nTuxtla Gutirrez (Chiapas), Mexico at 12:36 GMT-6.\\r\\nChihuahua, Mexico at 11:40?a.m.\\r\\nSunset from Zarautz, Basque Country Spain\\r\\nSunset, viewed from Coimbra, Portugal\\r\\nAstronomers Without Borders began collecting eclipse glasses for redistribution to Latin America for the total solar eclipse occurring on July 2, 2019 and to Asia for the annular eclipse on December 26, 2019.[156]\\r\\nA partial lunar eclipse took place on August 7, 2017, in the same eclipse season.

Eighth-ranked in the preseason, the Trojans were narrowly voted #1 in the first AP poll, and stayed out front for the rest of the year.\\r\\nDuring the twentieth century, the NCAA had no playoff for the major college football teams in the University Division, which became Division I in 1973 (and Division I-A in 1978). The NCAA Football Guide, however, did note an \\"unofficial national champion\\" based on the top ranked teams in the \\"wire service\\" (AP and UPI) polls. The \\"writers' poll\\" by Associated Press (AP) was the most popular, followed by the \\"coaches' poll\\" by United Press International) (UPI). Through the 1973 season, the UPI issued its final poll in early December before the bowls, but since 1968 (and 1965) the AP Trophy was withheld until the postseason was completed. The AP poll in 1972 consisted of the votes of fifty sportswriters, though not all of them voted in every poll. Those who cast votes would give their opinion of the ten best teams. Under a point system of twenty points for first place, nineteen for second, etc., the \\"overall\\" ranking was determined.\\r\\nThis season was historically significant because it was the first in which freshmen were eligible to play varsity football in the University Division. The NCAA had historically prohibited freshmen from varsity competition, except during the United States involvement in World War II. In 1968, the NCAA allowed freshman eligibility in the University Division in all sports, except football and basketball, and extended the rule to those sports effective with the 1972ÿ73 academic year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the last season for the \\"University\\" and \\"College\\" divisions. For the 1973 season, the NCAA created the three-division structure that exists today with teams and conferences designated accordingly:\\r\\nFive years later in 1978, Division I was subdivided (for football only) into I-A and I-AA. In 2006, these were renamed Division I FBS and FCS, respectively. Many of the teams and conferences now in FCS (Big Sky, Ohio Valley, SWAC, Yankee) were initially in Division II and moved up to I-AA.\\r\\nIn 1972, only the Rose Bowl (Big Ten vs. Pac-8) and Cotton Bowl (SWC winner) had rigid conference tie-ins. Thus, Big 8 champion Oklahoma passed up an Orange Bowl invitation to play in the Sugar Bowl, while SEC champion Alabama passed the Sugar to meet Texas in the Cotton. For the first time, the Sugar Bowl was played at night on New Year's Eve, rather than New Year's Day afternoon. With two consecutive victories in the Orange Bowl, #9 Nebraska was invited to a third against #12 Notre Dame.\\r\\nSunday, December 31, 1972\\r\\nMonday, January 1, 1973\\r\\nThe final AP poll in January was: 1.

The most widely held view is that Sri Lankan composer Ananda Samarakoon wrote the music and lyrics to the song inspired/influenced by Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore.[1][2][3][4] A minority suggest that Tagore wrote the anthem in full.[5][6][7][8] Some have suggested that Tagore wrote the music whilst Samarakoon wrote the lyrics.[9][10] Samarakoon had been a pupil of Tagore at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan.[11][12] After returning to Ceylon Samarakoon taught music at Mahinda College, Galle.[13][14] The song, which was then known as Namo Namo Mata, was first sung by students at Mahinda College.[15][16] After it was sung by the choir from Musaeus College, Colombo at a public event it became hugely popular in Ceylon and was widely played on radio.[17]\\r\\nPrior to Ceylon's independence (1948) the Lanka Gandharva Sabha had organised a competition to find a national anthem.[18][19] Among the entries were Namo Namo Matha by Samarakoon and Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima by P. B. Illangasinghe and Lionel Edirisinghe.[18][19] The latter won the competition but this was controversial as Illangasinghe and Edirisinghe were members of the judging panel.[18][19] Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima was broadcast by Radio Ceylon on the morning of 4 February 1948, independence day, but it was not sung at the official Freedom Day celebrations.[18][19] Ceylon continued to use the British national anthem as its official national anthem after independence.[20] At the first independence day ceremony held on 4 February 1949 at the Independence Memorial Hall in Torrington Square both Namo Namo Matha and Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima were sung, in Sinhala and Tamil, as \\"national songs\\".[18][21]\\r\\nMore specifically, in 1950 Minister of Finance J. R. Jayewardene requested that the government recognise Samarakoon's Namo Namo Matha as the official national anthem.[17] The government appointed a committee headed by Edwin Wijeyeratne, Minister of Home Affairs and Rural Development, to pick a new national anthem.[20] The committee heard several songs but, after much deliberation, picked Namo Namo Matha.[7][17][20] The committee made a minor change to Samarakoon's song, with his approval, changing the tenth line from \\"Nawajeewana Damine\\" to \\"Nawa Jeewana Demine Nithina Apapupudu Karan Matha\\".[17] The committee's decision was endorsed by the government on 22 November 1951.[13][20] The anthem was translated into the Tamil language by M. Nallathamby.[17][22][23] Namo Namo Matha was first sung as Ceylon's official national anthem at the independence day ceremony in 1952.[17][24]\\r\\nIn the late 1950s controversy arose over first line of the anthem, \\"Namo Namo Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\".[16][17] It was deemed to be \\"unlucky\\" and blamed for the country's misfortunes including the deaths of two prime ministers.[16] In February 1961 the government changed the line to their present form, \\"Sri Lanka Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\", despite Samarakoon's strong opposition.[17][22] Samarakoon committed suicide in April 1962, leaving a note complaining that his anthem had been mutilated.[17]\\r\\nThe Second Republican Constitution of 1978 gave Sri Lanka Matha constitutional recognition.[25]\\r\\nThe Sri Lankan national anthem is available in an identical version in two languages, Sinhala and Tamil, both official languages of the country. It is just one of a number that are sung in more than one language: Belgium (French, Dutch and German), Canada (English, French and Inuktitut), New Zealand (English and Mori), South Africa (Xhosa, Zulu, Sesotho, Afrikaans and English), Suriname (Dutch and Sranan Tongo) and Switzerland (German, French, Italian and Romansh).[23]\\r\\nSri Lanka Thaaye, the Tamil version of the Sri Lankan national anthem, is an exact translation of Sri Lanka Matha, the Sinhala version, and has the same music.[26] Although it has existed since independence in 1948 it was generally only sung in the north and east of the country where the Tamil language predominates.[26]\\r\\nThe majority of Sri Lankans (around 75%) speak the Sinhala language. More specifically, \\"Tamil is the native language for the Tamil people, who constitute about 15% of Sri Lankans, and for Muslims who are nearly 10%\\", according to the BBC.[26] Until early 2016, the Sinhala version was the only one to be used during official government events and it was the only version used during international sports and other events.[23] Although the Sinhala version of the anthem was used at official/state events, the Tamil version was also sung at some events in spite of the unofficial ban which ended in early 2016.\\r\\nThe Sinhala version of Sri Lanka Matha was used in all parts of the country with the exception of the North and the East which have a large Tamil population.[22][27][28] Some reports indicate that the Tamil version was used at official events held in the Tamil speaking regions in the North and East of Sri Lanka.[22][23] The Tamil version was sung at Tamil medium schools throughout the country.[22][23] The Tamil version was even used during the period when Sinhala was the only official language of the country (1956ÿ87).[22][23]\\r\\nOn 12 December 2010 The Sunday Times reported that the Cabinet of Sri Lanka headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa had taken the decision to scrap the Tamil translation of Sri Lanka Matha at official and state functions, as \\"in no other country was the national anthem used in more than one language\\" - even though the national anthems of Canada, South Africa and those of several other countries have more than one language version.[27] The Cabinet's decision had followed a paper on the national flag and national anthem produced by Public Administration and Home Affairs Minister W. D. J. Senewiratne.[22][29] The paper had drawn on the Singaporean model where the national anthem is sung in the official lyrics and not any translation of the lyrics.[22] Based on this the paper recommended that the Sri Lankan national anthem only be sung in Sinhala and the Tamil translation be abolished.[22] The paper's authors had failed to realise that the official lyrics of the Singaporean national anthem are in Malay, a minority language (75% of Singaporeans are Chinese).[30]\\r\\nGovernment minister Wimal Weerawansa had labelled the Tamil version a \\"joke\\" on Derana TV, and had cited India as an analogy.[31][32][33] Some journalists, such as D. B. S. Jeyaraj,[22] claimed that it was wrong of Weerawansa to cite India as an analogy because according to them the Indian national anthem was not in Hindi, which is the most widely spoken language of India, but in Bengali, a minority language.[34][35][36][37] Although sources based on an official Government of India website state that the Indian National anthem was adopted in its Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly of India,[38][39] the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly of India on 24 January 1950 does not mention that the National Anthem was \\"adopted\\", nor does it mention that it was done so in its Hindi version.[40][41] In actual practice the unaltered Bengali version is the version sung as the National Anthem, with its words in original Bengali Tatsama, a highly Sanskritized form of Bengali that has Sanskrit words common to both Hindi and Bengali.[42]\\r\\nThe Cabinet's December 2010 decision to scrap the Tamil translation of the anthem[43] (which was not subsequently enacted) caused much furore in Sri Lanka. Later, the government denied allegations that the Tamil translation was to be abolished.[44] The Presidential Secretariat has stated that there was no basis to the media report and follow up reports which intimated the same.[45] Nevertheless, an unofficial ban[28] on the Tamil version came into being as fearful public officials in Tamil speaking areas stopped using the Tamil version or blocked attempts to use it.[23][46] The Sri Lankan Army forcefully stopped any use of the Tamil version and taught school children to sing only the Sinhala version.[46][47][48][49]\\r\\nIn March 2015 newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena announced that he would be issuing a circular which would state that there was no ban on singing the national anthem in Tamil.[50][51] Sirisena's announcement was attacked by Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists.[52][53][54][55]\\r\\nDuring Sri Lanka's 68th national independence day celebrations on 4 February 2016, the Tamil version of the anthem was sung for the first time since 1949 at an official government event, the independence day celebrations.[56] Lifting of the unofficial ban on the Tamil version had been approved by President Maithripala Sirisena (who had said he would unite the nation after the nearly 26-year civil war that ended in 2009) and by others in the government.[28] This step was viewed as part of the plan for \\"post-civil war ethnic reconciliation\\".[57]\\r\\nNaturally, Sri Lanka Matha was also sung in the majority Sinhalese. Some groups, and Sri Lanka's former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, were opposed to the government officially allowing the Tamil version to be sung.[26][58][26][59][60]\\r\\n????? ???? ????\\r\\n?? ?????....... ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n?????? ????????? ?????? ??? ?????? ????\\r\\n?????? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ?? ????? ??????\\r\\n?? ?? ??? ???? ??? ???? ?????? ????\\r\\n??????? ??? ?? ????? ????\\r\\n??? ??? ????\\r\\n?? ????? ...... ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n\\r\\n?? ?? ?? ???????\\r\\n?? ?? ?? ??????\\r\\n?? ?? ?? ?????\\r\\n?? ?? ??? ?????\\r\\n?? ?? ?????\\r\\n???? ??????????\\r\\n?? ?? ???? ??\\r\\n?? ??????? ?? ??\\r\\n\\r\\n?? ???? ?????? ????? ?? ?????? ???? ????\\r\\n??? ????? ?????? ????? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???\\r\\n?? ????? ??? ??? ??????\\r\\n??? ??? ?? ?????\\r\\n?????? ??? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n?? ?????........ ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n???? ????? ???? - ??? ???? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n????????? ???? ?????\\r\\n??????? ?????? ???? ??????? ?????\\r\\n????? ????? ?? ???? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n????????? ???? ?????\\r\\n?????? ???????? ?? ?????????\\r\\n?????? ??? ????\\r\\n????? ?????? ???? ????????\\r\\n???????? ???? - ??? ???? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n\\r\\n????????? ?????\\r\\n??? ????? ??????????\\r\\n?????? ?????????\\r\\n????? ?????????? ?????\\r\\n????????? ??????\\r\\n??? ??? ?????????\\r\\n????????? ????????\\r\\n???????? ?????????\\r\\n\\r\\n?????? ??? ????\\r\\n???? ???? ?? ??????? ????\\r\\n?????????? ??? ????? ????????\\r\\n????????? ??????? ????\\r\\n?????? ???????? ??? ????\\r\\n?????? ????????????\\r\\n?? ??????? ???????? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ???? - ??? ???? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\nSri Lanka Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\r\\nNamo Namo Namo Namo Matha\\r\\nSundara siri barini\\r\\nSurendi athi sobamana Lanka\\r\\nDhanya dhanaya neka\\r\\nMal palathuru piri, jaya bhoomiya ramya\\r\\nApa hata sapa siri setha sadana\\r\\nJeewanaye Matha!\\r\\nPiliganu mena apa bhakthi puja\\r\\nNamo Namo Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\r\\nNamo Namo Namo Namo Matha\\r\\n\\r\\nObawe apa widya\\r\\nObamaya apa sathya\\r\\nObawe apa shakti\\r\\nApa hada thula bhakthi\\r\\nOba apa aloke\\r\\nAapage anuprane\\r\\nOba apa jeewana we\\r\\nApa mukthiya obawe\\r\\n\\r\\nNawa jeewana demine\\r\\nNnithina apa pubudu karan Matha\\r\\nGnana weerya wadawamina ragena\\r\\nYanu mena jaya bhoomi kara\\r\\nEka mawekuge daru kala bawina\\r\\nYamu yamu wee nopama\\r\\nPrema wada sama bheda durara da\\r\\nNamo Namo Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\r\\nNamo Namo Namo Namo Matha\\r\\nSrؐ la?k ty ÿ nam Srؐ la?k\\r\\nNam nam nam nam ty\\r\\nNalle?il poli cؐra?i\\r\\nNala?ka? yvum ni?ai v?ma?i la?k\\r\\n?lam puka? va?a vayal nati malai malar\\r\\nNa?u?clai ko? la?k\\r\\nNamatu?u pukali?am e?a o?irvy\\r\\nNamatuti l ty\\r\\nNamatalai ni?ata?i ml vaittm\\r\\nNamatuyir ty ÿ nam Srؐ la?k\\r\\nNam nam nam nam ty\\r\\n\\r\\nNamatraru? ?y\\r\\nNavai tavir u?arv?y\\r\\nNamatere valiy?y\\r\\nNavil cutantiram ?y\\r\\nNamati?amaiyai n??\\r\\nNaku ma?i ta?aiy??\\r\\nAmaivu?um a?ivu?a?\\r\\nA?alce?i tu?ivaru?\\r\\n\\r\\nNamatr o?i va?am\\r\\nNa?iya malar e?a nilavum ty\\r\\nYmellm oru karu?ai a?aipayanta\\r\\nE?ilko? cyka? e?av\\r\\nIyalu?u pi?avuka? tamai a?av\\r\\nI?ive?a nؐkki?uvm\\r\\nؐ?a cirma?i v?vu?u pma?i\\r\\nNam nam ty ÿ nam Srؐ la?k\\r\\nNam nam nam nam ty\\r\\nThou Mother Lanka,\\r\\nOh Mother Lanka we salute, salute, salute, salute Thee!\\r\\nPlenteous in prosperity, Thou,\\r\\nBeauteous in grace and love,\\r\\nLaden with grain and luscious fruit,\\r\\nAnd fragrant flowers of radiant hue,\\r\\nGiver of life and all good things,\\r\\nOur land of joy and victory,\\r\\nReceive our grateful praise sublime, we worship, worship Thee.\\r\\nOh Mother Lanka!

Burton.[2]\\r\\nAlthough the Democratic party retained their majority (27D to 25R) in the state Senate after the 2003 general election, a party switch by former Democratic Senator, James Shannon Walley of Leakesville threw control of the chamber to the Republicans. Walley was elected as a Democrat in 2003 to represent District 43, which includes George, Greene, Stone, and Wayne counties, then announced he was switching parties and won re-election as a Republican. Because the Lieutenant Governor at that time, Amy Tuck, was a Republican (and also a previous party switcher), this gave Republicans control of the Senate for the first time since Reconstruction and a defacto majority only on a tie vote.\\r\\nUntil January 2008, the Senate contained 25 Democrats and 27 Republicans. Democrats enjoyed a net gain of three seats in the November 6, 2007 statewide elections and won back control of the chamber by a 28ÿ24 margin until Senator Nolan Mettetal announced his party switch in February, 2008. The Senate balance was 27ÿ25, with the Democrats holding the slim majority until Cindy Hyde-Smith switched parties, giving the GOP a 26ÿ26 de facto majority, with Lieutenant Governor Phil Bryant holding the tiebreaker vote. After the switch of Ezell Lee on February 17, 2011, the GOP expanded their majority to 27ÿ24, with one vacancy. The majority was expanded in the general election later that year to 31-21, including the party switch of Sen. Gray Tollison.\\r\\nCoordinates: 321814N 901056W? / ?32.30389N 90.18222W? / 32.30389; -90.18222","input":"Who is the leader of the ms state senate?"},{"output":"Anthem Wrestling Exhibitions, LLC","context":"Impact Wrestling is an American professional wrestling promotion currently based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The promotion operates as a subsidiary of Anthem Sports & Entertainment via it's parent company[10] Anthem Wrestling Exhibitions, LLC[11][12][10][11][12]\\r\\nFounded by Jeff and Jerry Jarrett in 2002,[13] in Nashville, Tennessee, the promotion was initially known as NWA: Total Nonstop Action (NWA-TNA) and was associated with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). It withdrew from the NWA in 2004 and became known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), but it continued to use the NWA World Heavyweight and the NWA World Tag Team championships as part of an agreement. After the agreement ended in 2007, the company created its own TNA World Heavyweight and TNA World Tag Team championships. The promotion was purchased by Anthem at the beginning of 2017, and it was renamed Impact Wrestling after its main television series.\\r\\nImpact Wrestling (under its former name, TNA) had been considered the second largest professional wrestling promotion in the United States behind WWE up to at least 2015.[14][15] However, from mid-2017, Impact has become increasingly viewed to have fallen behind longtime rival Ring of Honor.[16][17][18] Loss of their former television contract and personnel issues have been noted as contributing factors.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of TNA originated shortly after World Championship Wrestling (WCW) ended in 2001. Bob Ryder, Jeff Jarrett and Jerry Jarrett went on a fishing trip and contemplated their futures in the professional wrestling business.[20] Only one wrestling product remained on United States national television: the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE). Ryder felt that this situation led many television stations to regard professional wrestling as bad for business, so he suggested a company not reliant on television, but rather one going straight to pay-per-view.[20] In July 2002, Vince Russo joined Jeff and Jerry Jarrett's NWA-TNA promotion as a creative writer and would assist in the writing and production of the shows. Russo states that he coined the name \\"Total Nonstop Action\\", the initials of the company \\"TNA\\" being a play on \\"T&A\\", short for \\"Tits and Ass\\". The original intention, as they were exclusive to pay-per-view, was to be viewed as an edgier product than WWE.[21]\\r\\nThe Jarretts found the financial backing they needed and the company put on its first show on June 19, 2002. That night, however, in a dark match just before they went on the air, a 450 lb wrestler named Cheex hit the ropes with so much force that one of them broke. The estimated repair time was 30ÿ60 minutes, which they did not have because the schedule called for them to go live in a few minutes, whether the ring was ready or not. Backstage, the producers shuffled the schedule so that some non-wrestling segments went first to give the ring crew some more time, but they did not have many of them. The ring crew fixed the rope with the help of Ron and Don Harris, and everyone went live hoping for the best.[20]\\r\\nInitially, TNA's weekly pay-per-view show operated as the company's main source of revenue, in place of monthly pay-per-view events used by other promotions. These shows took place mostly at the Tennessee State Fairground Sports Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, nicknamed the \\"TNA Asylum\\". After 27 months and 111 pay-per-view events, TNA began holding a weekly television show and monthly three-hour pay-per-views.[22] The last weekly pay-per-view took place on September 8, 2004. Xplosion launched on November 27, 2002 as TNA's first regular cable show and featured exclusive matches from the TNA Asylum as well as exclusive interviews with TNA wrestlers. On November 18, 2004, the show became a recap show of the previous week's Impact! in light of alterations in the taping schedule. Xplosion resumed airing exclusive matches (billed as \\"Xplosion Xclusives\\") once more on October 7, 2005 in addition to recapping Impact!. The \\"Xplosion Xclusives\\" also aired on the now-ceased TNA Global Impact! internet show. Airing of Xplosion in the United States ceased at the end of 2006, although some of the exclusive matches can be seen on TNA Today.\\r\\nIn May 2004, TNA introduced a television program, Impact! (stylized as iMPACT!), produced at Soundstage 21 at Universal Studios Florida and broadcast on Fox Sports.[23] The transition included the use of a six-sided wrestling ring,[24][25] the implementation of the \\"Fox Box\\" displaying competitors and timekeeping for the match[26][unreliable source?] and a generally more sports-like style than the sports entertainment style exemplified by WWE.[26]\\r\\nWith the switch to cable television, TNA discontinued their weekly pay-per-view shows in favor of a monthly 3-hour pay-per-view format as previously used by WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and as currently used by WWE. In November 2004, TNA held the first of these pay-per-views, Victory Road, beginning the pattern of pay-per-view shows that continued until 2013.\\r\\nThe television contract with Fox Sports expired in May 2005 and was not renegotiated, leaving TNA without television exposure.[27] This prompted TNA to air Impact! via webcasts?ÿ originally made available via BitTorrent and eventually via RealPlayer?ÿ and on Urban America Television replacing Xplosion. During this time, TNA continued pursuing a profitable television deal for regular broadcasting.[28][29] TNA would later secure a deal with Spike TV and aired its first episode on October 1, 2005.[30]\\r\\nIn October 2006, TNA began holding select pay-per-views outside of its central filming location, the Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida, with Bound for Glory. In April 2006, TNA began a partnership with YouTube, under which TNA supplied YouTube with exclusive video-content in exchange for hosting, leading to the production of internet shows. In January 2007, TNA's mobile-content deal with New Motion, Inc. led to the introduction of TNA Mobile and mobile fan-voting.[31] TNA has also launched \\"TNA U TV\\"; podcasts aired through YouTube to help promote the company.[32] Impact! expanded to a two-hour format on October 4, 2007.[33] On June 21, 2009, TNA launched an online video-vault subscription-service where subscribers could watch past pay-per-views by choosing one of three payment options.[34]\\r\\nOn October 23, 2008, TNA made the transition to HD and since then, all programming has been broadcast in high-definition.[35] In addition, TNA introduced a new HD set that included new lighting and several large high-resolution screens.[36]\\r\\nIn 2010, TNA hired professional wrestling legend Hulk Hogan and former WCW President Eric Bischoff. Both obtained a position behind the screen (Bischoff was part of creative and Hogan a consultant) and made some changes. They also hired many high-profile former WWE wrestlers, including Ric Flair, Rob Van Dam, Mr. Anderson and Jeff Hardy, while returning to a four sided ring. On February 15, TNA made a new deal with Spike TV, which moved Impact! to Monday nights, directly opposite of Raw (although the network kept the Thursday night slot open for repeats of the Monday night shows). The first episode took place on March 8.[37]\\r\\nOn 3 May, TNA moved Impact! back to Thursday nights, re-branded as \\"TNA Thursdays\\".[38] At the same time, Spike also picked up TNA Reaction (stylized as TNA ReAction or, alternatively, as TNA ReACTION), which became a regular one-hour docu-series on June 24. ReAction focused on the stories and characters of TNA and previewed the upcoming episode of Impact!.[39][40] On February 24, 2011, TNA began holding Impact! tapings at the Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, North Carolina.[41] On 3 May, Impact! was re-branded Impact Wrestling.[42][43][44]\\r\\nOn November 7, TNA revealed that Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) would become TNA's official developmental territory.[45] In December 2011, TNA debuted their new India-based subsidiary promotion Ring Ka King.[46] On May 31, 2012, Impact Wrestling began airing live at a new start time of 8 p.m. EST on Thursday nights.[47] The live schedule would continue throughout 2012.[48] On July 11, DirecTV, the carrier of Spike, blocked all Viacom stations affecting TNA viewership from DirecTV subscribers.[49] After DirectTV and Viacom reached agreement, the removed channels were added back on July 20.[50] In March 2013, TNA began taping Impact from different venues around the United States and terminated its lease with Universal Studios.[51] On March 14, TNA introduced a new universal HD stage which would be used for all weekly programming.[52] On November 2, TNA ended its relationship with OVW.[53]\\r\\nTNA formed a relationship with Japanese promotion Wrestle-1 beginning in July 2013 with a meeting between TNA founder Jeff Jarrett and Wrestle-1 head Keiji Mutoh.[54] It was arranged for Jarrett to wrestle for W-1 in October 2013.[55] In November, A.J. Styles successfully defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at a Wrestle-1 show in Japan.[56]\\r\\nFrom the period of 2013 to 2014, many well-known names or veterans of the company left TNA. Hulk Hogan's contract with TNA expired in October 2013[57] and he returned to WWE in early 2014.[58] In December 2013, A.J. Styles left TNA after his contract expired.[59] Styles later said that he could not accept TNA's new contract offer which would see him take a 60% cut in pay.[60] Also in December 2013, TNA founder Jeff Jarrett \\"resigned\\" from the company.[61] TNA accepted his resignation but clarified that Jarrett was still an \\"investor\\" in TNA. In spite of his investor status, the following year Jarrett revealed plans to start a new professional wrestling promotion, Global Force Wrestling.[62] The departures did not stop in 2014, with TNA veterans Sting,[63] Chris Sabin,[64] Hernandez,[65] Christopher Daniels and Kazarian all leaving the company in that year,[66] and the contracts of TNA Hall of Famers Bully Ray and Devon reportedly expired in October 2014, with TNA moving them to the alumni section of their roster in January 2015.[67]\\r\\nIn late July, the TMZ website reported that Spike TV was not renewing Impact Wrestling beyond October.[68] In response, TNA refuted the report, stating that negotiations were still ongoing.[69] On August 14, TNA moved Impact Wrestling from its Thursday timeslot to Wednesday nights.[70] On August 20, TNA signed an extension with Spike TV until the end of 2014.[71]\\r\\nThe 2014 Bound for Glory pay-per-view was held in collaboration with Wrestle-1 in Tokyo, Japan on October 12; the TNA World Heavyweight and the TNA World Tag Team titles were not defended at the event, which featured TNA wrestlers James Storm and The Great Sanada against Wrestle-1's The Great Muta and Tajiri in the main event.[72] After Bound for Glory, TNA effectively went into hiatus due to Impact Wrestling ending their contract with Spike TV and its subsequent move to Destination America. The show ceased airing new televised events after November 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, with the final episodes of 2014 being dedicated to Best of TNA clip shows, before resuming events on January 7, 2015 with a live show from The Manhattan Center's Grand Ballroom in New York City.[73][74][75]\\r\\nAs revealed in November 2014, TNA ended its relationship with Spike and instead partnered with Discovery Communications to distribute its programming beginning in January 2015. In the United States, TNA programs, including Impact Wrestling, moved to Destination America. Discovery also held rights in selected international markets.[76] Spike's outreach at the time was estimated to be more than 97 million homes while Destination America was estimated to reach 59 million households.[77] However, Destination America was one of the fastest growing cable networks.[78][unreliable source]\\r\\nImpact Wrestling premiered on Destination America on Wednesday, January 7 at 9:00?p.m.[79] TNA also started two new shows: Impact Wrestling: Unlocked, hosted by Mike Tenay,[80] and TNA Wrestling's Greatest Matches, a series presenting the best matches in the company's history.[81] From December 2014 to March 2015, several employees re-signed with TNA, including Kurt Angle,[82] Jeff Hardy, Gail Kim, Mr. Anderson, Abyss and Matt Hardy.[83][83][84] Awesome Kong also re-joined the company following several years of absence.[84] During this period, veteran Samoa Joe and commentator Tazz left the company by mutual consent.[85][86]\\r\\nOn April 27, 2015, Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan joined TNA as senior producer of creative and talent development.[87]\\r\\nDestination America gained over 41.94 million viewers over the course of 2015's first quarter, making this the channel's best first quarter ever,[78][88] followed by their best May ever in prime time. In both cases, Discovery Communications touted Impact Wrestling as one of the reasons for the increase in viewers.[89] Despite this success, Discovery Communications dropped Unlocked and Greatest Matches from their programming in May 2015.[90][91]\\r\\nOn November 19, TNA signed a deal with Pop to air Impact Wrestling,[92] where it premiered on Tuesday, January 5, 2016, in a live special held at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. With this move to Pop, Impact Wrestling introduced a new HD set, graphics and theme music. This show saw the semi-finals and finals of the TNA World Title Series, which was won by Ethan Carter III. Husband and wife team Mike Bennett and Maria Kanellis would debut soon after. Subsequent shows would include episodes taped during a tour of England, which would be the last TNA appearances for Kurt Angle. TNA returned to taping Impact Wrestling at the Impact Zone at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, beginning with a live Impact Wrestling on March 15. On March 19, longtime TNA wrestlers Eric Young and Bobby Roode left the promotion after 12 years.[93] On April 22, Velvet Sky, another longtime TNA wrestler, left the company.[94]\\r\\nOn August 12, Billy Corgan became the promotion's new President, while Dixie Carter became Chairwoman and Chief Strategy Officer.[95] On October 13, Corgan sued TNA due to an unpaid debt which Corgan claimed TNA has defaulted on. The state of Tennessee has also put a lien on TNA for unpaid taxes.[96] Anthem Sports & Entertainment, parent company of Impact Wrestling Canadian broadcaster Fight Network, offered to help TNA and repay Corgan for the loans, while also offering additional financial assistance to TNA to help keep them from filing for bankruptcy.[97] On October 31, Corgan lost his injunction that kept TNA from selling the company, but TNA was required to pay Corgan back by November 1. It was possible that one of the other minority owners could pay Corgan, effectively making them the majority owner of TNA.[98][unreliable source] On November 3, the company revealed that Anthem Sports & Entertainment provided a credit facility to fund operations for TNA and that Corgan was no longer with the company as President.[99] However, Corgan himself stated that neither TNA nor Anthem Sports & Entertainment had yet repaid the $2.7 million debt that was owed to him by TNA[100] and, as such, he was considering suing, as well as converting the debt into a 36% stake.[101] As the result of a settlement between Corgan and TNA, Anthem Sports & Entertainment had acquired the loans Corgan made to Dixie.[102]\\r\\nIn January 2017, CBS Corporation, which owns the Pop cable channel, joined Hulu's new live stream service to broadcast TNA. Anthem Sports & Entertainment purchased a majority stake of TNA, re-organizing TNA's parent company. Dixie Carter retained a 5% minority stake in the company, but resigned as Chairwoman after fourteen years with the company and joined Fight Media Group's advisory board. The promotion's parent company, TNA Entertainment, was changed firstly to Impact Ventures and then to Anthem Wrestling Exhibitions, LLC., with Anthem's Executive Vice President Ed Nordholm becoming President of the new parent company.[6] On January 5, Jeff Jarrett was brought back by Anthem to serve as a consultant.[103] On March 2, all appearances of the name TNA were dropped at the TV tapings. At the same tapings, Bruce Prichard stated that the name was \\"dead\\", with Anthem re-branding the promotion as Impact Wrestling, the name of its primary television platform.[104] Wrestlers Drew Galloway, Matt Hardy, Jeff Hardy, Jade, Crazzy Steve, Mike Bennett and Maria Kanellis left the company during this period. On April 20, Impact announced a merger with the original Global Force Wrestling.[105] The company then announced they were rebranding again, taking the GFW name.[1] The following September, Anthem's press releases once again started referring to the company as Impact Wrestling.[106] On October 10, Anthem released the Global Wrestling Network as an alternative to the WWE Network. The Global Wrestling Network primarily features Impact/GFW's tape library but also includes content from other sources.[107] On October 23, Impact Wrestling announced the termination of its relationship with Jeff Jarrett and his company Global Force Entertainment Inc., officially ending the attempted rebranding into GFW.[108] In December 2017, Anthem announced they hired Don Callis and Scott D'Amore to take charge of Impact Wrestlings day-to-day operations. On January 10, on the first set of tapings under the new leadership, the company reverted to a four-sided ring. These tapings also saw the return of former World Champion Austin Aries.\\r\\nThe promotion was originally formed by the Jarretts under a parent company known as J Sports & Entertainment, LLC.[2]\\r\\nPanda Energy International purchased a controlling interest (71%) in the company in 2002 from Jerry Jarrett,[109] re-incorporating it as TNA Entertainment, LLC, in the process. In 2012, Panda Energy divested itself of its stake in TNA. Dixie Carter, the daughter of Panda Energy founder Robert Carter, who had been serving as TNA's president, acquired that stake, making her TNA's majority shareholder. Jeff Jarrett departed the company on December 22, 2013, but remained as minority shareholder until his temporary return on June 24, 2015, with the deal for his return including the transfer of his minority stake to Dixie Carter, making her sole shareholder.[110][111][112][113]\\r\\nAccording to a report on August 7, 2015, TNA filed a new business name of Impact Ventures, LLC.[3] It was reported near the beginning of 2016 that Aroluxe Marketing, a Brentwood, Tennessee-based marketing agency, had taken a stake in TNA at the start of 2016 in return for providing partial funding, as well as taking over TNA's production operations.[114] It was reported in June 2016 that Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan acquired a minority stake in TNA from Dixie Carter, but he had instead provided a loan to Carter.[115][116] Then on August 12, TNA appointed Corgan as the company's new President and the transition of Carter from President to the company's new Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer.[4] It was reported on September 16 by the New York Post that Canada's Fight Network, through its parent company, Anthem Sports & Entertainment Corporation, had taken a stake in TNA.[114] On November 4, Corgan was removed as President,[117] then on November 30 it also reported that Corgan had settled his lawsuit against TNA, with Anthem Sports & Entertainment Corp acquiring the loans Corgan made to Dixie in the process.[102]\\r\\nIn early 2017, TNA would go through a restructuring period that would see an ownership change, with Anthem taking 85%, Aroluxe 10% and Dixie Carter 5%.[9][9][118] On January 4, 2017, Anthem Sports & Entertainment purchased an 85% majority stake of the company, re-organizing TNA's parent company to Anthem Wrestling Exhibitions, LLC, and Carter resigned as Chairwoman after 14 years in charge, while joining the advisory board of Fight Media Group. Ed Nordholm, Anthem's Executive Vice President, then took over Anthem Wrestling Exhibitions as President.[6] Shortly after Anthem's acquisition of TNA, it was re-branded to Impact Wrestling. On January 5, Jeff Jarrett was brought back to the company by Anthem as an executive consultant.[103] Eventually, Jarrett was made the company's Executive Producer and Chief Creative Officer by Anthem. In June 2017, Anthem completed the acquisition of Jarrett's newer promotion, Global Force Wrestling, merging it with Impact Wrestling; the combined company took the GFW name. As a result of the merger, Jarrett gained a minority share in the new GFW, alongside Aroluxe and Dixie Carter.[105] In September 2017, Jarrett was suspended for behavior issues, and departed a month later. The promotion has since reverted to the Impact Wrestling name, as the acquisition of the \\"GFW\\" name from Jarrett had not actually been finalized.\\r\\nFrom 2002ÿ2004, the promotion's original weekly pay-per-view shows took place mostly at the Tennessee State Fairground Sports Arena in Nashville, Tennessee, nicknamed the \\"TNA Asylum\\".\\r\\nFrom June 2004 to March 2013, TNA taped its flagship show, Impact! as well as its secondary show Xplosion at Universal Studios Orlando's Soundstage 21, which the company dubbed the \\"Impact Zone\\". They also aired their monthly pay-per-views from that location until October 2006 when Bound for Glory was broadcast from the Compuware Arena in Detroit.\\r\\nInitially, TNA worked with Hermie Sadler's United Wrestling Federation in 2005 to create house shows. TNA permitted the usage of the ring and for championships to be defended at these events. TNA started running independent house shows on March 17, 2006.[119] They would continue to work with United Wrestling Federation and promote independent shows at the same time, until 2007. In 2007, TNA first toured Europe, hosting two shows at Porto and Lisbon in Portugal with APW Wrestling. In 2008, TNA wrestlers appeared at Wrestle Kingdom II in Japan. Later on in 2008, TNA conducted its first tour of England, with most shows selling out. The promotion first toured Germany, Scotland and Ireland in 2009, France, Wales and the United Arab Emirates in 2010 and Belgium in 2012.\\r\\nIn August 2007, live-events coordinator Craig Jenkins stated that TNA intended to stage eight pay-per-views and 96 house shows outside Orlando, Florida in 2008.[120]\\r\\nIn 2009 on TNA United Kingdom tour, a house show at Wembley Arena in London broke TNA's attendance records. On July 2, 2010, MCU Park hosted a live TNA house show, which also broke the TNA domestic attendance record at the time and is currently the most attended live TNA house show in the United States, with a capacity crowd of 5,550.[121]\\r\\nOn January 31, 2013, TNA announced that they would tape their weekly show Impact Wrestling in different venues around the United States, with the first live show being held on March 14, in the Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, Illinois (a Chicago suburb).[122]\\r\\nOn November 21, 2013, TNA returned to Universal Studios due to rising costs of taping Impact Wrestling from different venues.[123] Since the return to Universal Orlando, most episodes have been taped there, although some episodes have been taped from The Sands Casino Event Center in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,[124] the Manhattan Center's Grand Ballroom in New York City,[125][126] at The SSE Hydro in Glasgow, The Manchester Arena in Manchester, and Wembley Arena in London as part of a January 2015 tour, and, in June 2017, in India, becoming the first major promotion to tape in that country. After Bound for Glory 2017, Impact did a set of tapings in Ottawa.\\r\\nThroughout its history, Impact has worked with several international wrestling promotions, with championships from those promotions sometimes having been defended at Impact Wrestling events. Among the organizations Impact has worked with are Mexico's Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), Japan's Inoki Genome Federation (IGF), New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Wrestle-1 (W-1) and America's Evolve Wrestling.[127] TNA's relationship with NJPW lasted from 2008 to 2011, and included TNA sending wrestlers to participate in NJPW's annual Wrestle Kingdom event, as well as NJPW sending future IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada on a training excursion to TNA; however, the relationship soured in 2011, when IWGP Tag Team Champions Team 3D were held off of a New Japan tour in favor of appearing on Impact Wrestling and Okada was given a Green Hornet-inspired gimmick.[128]\\r\\nOn March 2, 2014, TNA collaborated with Wrestle-1 in producing the Kaisen: Outbreak supershow in Tokyo, Japan where three TNA championships were defended.[129][130] In May 2015, it was reported that the relationship between TNA and Wrestle-1 had ended.[131]\\r\\nImpact Wrestling also had a working agreement with Mexico's Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA).[132]\\r\\nIn February 2017, Impact established a new working agreement with Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling Noah.[133]\\r\\nImpact Wrestling formed a Partnership with Konnan's The Crash Lucha Libre promotion in March 2017.\\r\\nOn March 24, 2017, it was announced that Impact Wrestling has formed a partnership with television station ITV in the United Kingdom to bring World of Sport Wrestling back on the air in the UK, after a thirty-year hiatus.[134]\\r\\nImpact Wrestling has also worked with American independent promotions in various collaborative efforts, such as the original Global Force Wrestling (also founded by Jeff Jarrett) and OMEGA Championship Wrestling (owned by Matt Hardy, Jeff Hardy and Gregory Helms).\\r\\nSince its origin, Impact Wrestling has featured a high-flying, high risk style of wrestling known as its X Division. Rather than emphasizing the fact that most wrestlers who perform this style are under 220?lb (100?kg) by calling it a cruiserweight division, Impact Wrestling (then TNA) decided to emphasize the high risk nature of the moves that these wrestlers perform, removing all restraints on its wrestlers, allowing them to perform almost stunt like wrestling moves.[citation needed]\\r\\nOriginally, there was no weight limit on the X Division or its title, though in practice, most of the wrestlers in this division have been cruiserweights, with Samoa Joe, billed at 280?lb (130?kg), Kurt Angle, billed at 230?lb (100?kg), and Abyss, billed at 350?lb (160?kg), being notable exceptions.[citation needed] To further emphasize this point, the slogan \\"It's not about weight limits, it's about no limits\\" was used to describe the division.[135] Although it was de-emphasized throughout 2007, the X Division is generally regarded[who?] as one of the key attractions of Impact Wrestling. In August 2011, a 225?lb (102?kg) weight limit was introduced.[136] This was quietly repealed in March 2012. Changes introduced in March 2013, including a weight limit of 230?lbs. and making all matches triple threat matches,[137] were repealed in August.[138][139]\\r\\nFrom the promotion's first show in June 2002, TNA used a standard four-sided wrestling ring. In June 2004, with the premier of Impact!, TNA switched to a six-sided ring, as occasionally used in the Mexican promotion AAA.[140] TNA used the six-sided ring until January 2010.[141] A fan-voted poll to determine what type of ring the company would use was held in June 2014,[142] and the six-sided ring won.[143] In January 2018, Impact announced that they are returning to a four-sided wrestling ring.[144]\\r\\nImpact wrestlers are forbidden by contract from working for other companies with televised wrestling shows, but are free to perform non-televised work for any other independent wrestling promotions, domestic or international, as well as televised events held by foreign promotions that Impact Wrestling is linked to or has a working relationship with promotions such as AAA, NJPW and Ring Ka King.[145] Many Impact wrestlers perform regularly for various promotions on the independent circuit in addition to Impact Wrestling weekly shows. In 2012, Impact Wrestling (then TNA) changed policy, preventing its talent from appearing at any independent events that are later released on DVD.[146] However, this was later altered due to the lack of TNA shows in late 2014 and many TNA wrestlers appeared at independent events, but were not allowed to appear on any TV or pay-per-view tapings.[citation needed] The top Impact wrestlers have guaranteed contracts, but the majority of Impact wrestlers are paid on a per appearance basis.[145] Impact wrestlers are classified as independent contractors and are not offered health coverage through the promotion.[145] As of November 2017, Impact Wrestling contracts give the performers complete ownership over all intellectual property associated with their characters.[147]\\r\\nThe Impact Wrestling Hall of Fame was introduced on May 31, 2012, as the TNA Hall of Fame. As part of the yearly process, selected inductees will be chosen based on their overall contributions to Impact Wrestling' history.[148][149] On June 10 at Slammiversary 10, Sting was revealed as the first inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame and his formal induction took place at Bound for Glory in October 2012.[150] On June 2, 2013, former TNA President Dixie Carter revealed that the newest member of the TNA Hall of Fame was Kurt Angle, who was officially inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame on October 19, 2013.[151] At Slammiversary XII on June 15, 2014, Angle revealed Team 3D as the next inductees to the TNA Hall of Fame.[152] In 2015, Jeff Jarrett returned to TNA and was inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame. Impact referee Earl Hebner was also inducted. At Bound for Glory on October 2, 2016, Gail Kim was inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame.","input":"Who is the owner of tna impact wrestling?"},{"output":"A double-twelve set","context":"Mexican Train is a game played with dominoes.

However, the station piece is not strictly needed, and anything from coins to poker chips to even pieces of candy or slips of paper can be used as markers.\\r\\nThe object of all Trains games is to be the first player to place all of their dominoes. Dominoes may be placed onto the player's train, onto the Mexican train if available, or on the trains of other players under special circumstances.The middle tile counts as the start of your multiple tile train.\\r\\nAt the start of each round, the dominoes are placed face side down, shuffled, and drawn by players to form their hands. Using the double-nine set, players draw dominoes as follows:\\r\\nAny remaining dominoes are placed to one side, forming the \\"boneyard\\".\\r\\nWith a standard double-twelve set the double twelve is placed in the station. In each successive round the next lower double is used until all doubles are used. The double-blank is the final round.\\r\\nPlay continues to the left.[1][2] Each person lays one legally placed domino per turn, or two if the player's first domino is a double. If they are unable to, they must draw a domino from the boneyard. If they are able to lay that domino, they must do so immediately.[1] Otherwise, their turn is over and play continues to the left, each player trying to place all their dominoes by playing matching dominoes one at a time, end to end.[1][2]\\r\\nA train can be as long as the players can make it; it only ends when all dominoes that could match its endpoint have already been played. As a result, trains can become quite long, especially with an extended domino set. It is acceptable to \\"bend\\" the train 90 or 180 to keep the train on the playing surface, as long as it does not interfere with the endpoints of other trains.\\r\\nAll trains begin the game as \\"public\\", and all players may play on it. When a player plays a domino on their train it then becomes \\"private\\". When a player draws a domino and is unable play it, they must mark their train as \\"public\\" by placing a marker on their train.[1] If a player is deemed to have made a strategic error the highest score of that round is added to theirs.\\r\\nPlayers have the option, whether they can play on their own train or not, of playing a domino on any train currently marked \\"public\\". When a player with a \\"public\\" train adds a domino to it, it becomes \\"private\\" again and may not be played on except by the train's owner.[2]\\r\\nThe Mexican Train is an additional train that anyone may play on during their turn. They can start the train by playing a domino matching the engine (i.e. the double played at the beginning of the round) or add to the train. Mexican trains can be added as long as a space remains.\\r\\nWhen a double is played, it is placed perpendicular to the train. Subsequently, adding a domino to the double is called \\"finishing\\", \\"satisfying the double\\" or \\"covering the double\\".\\r\\nThe player who played the double must take another turn. This additional turn follows exactly the same rules as any normal turn. They may play anywhere they like, and do not have to \\"finish the double\\" on this turn. They may play elsewhere and, provided they make a legal play, do not have to mark their train for not finishing the double (unless the double was played on their own train). Blanks are wild. Like any other turn, if they cannot play they must draw a domino and mark their train as \\"public\\".[2]\\r\\nIf a double remains unfinished after it has been played, the train becomes a \\"public\\" train. No other train can be added to by any player until someone \\"finishes the double\\". Play passes to the next player who can legally play on this train (if the train is theirs, or if they can legally play on \\"public\\" trains). If they cannot \\"finish the double\\", they must draw a domino, and if they cannot play it on the double, their own train becomes \\"public\\". Play continues like this until someone \\"finishes the double\\". Single and double blanks are considered wilds.\\r\\nBranching on doubles as in Chicken Foot is allowed as an option (see Variations below).[2]\\r\\nAt the end of each round, the player going out receives 0 points, while all other players receive the sum of all pips (dots) on their dominoes. The person with the fewest points after all thirteen rounds have been played is the winner. In the case of a tie, the person with the most 0-point rounds is the winner. (If this is still a tie, the person with the lowest round total other than 0 is the winner).\\r\\nWith four, six or eight players, the game can be played in teams of two, with partners sitting opposite each other. Rules are identical except that a player's train and their partner's train are considered one and the same (they will usually extend from opposite sides of the station), and thus a player can play on their own end or their partner's, and neither end becomes public until neither partner can play a tile. Scoring is also handled in pairs, with the player who went out scoring zero for their team (even though their partner will have dominoes remaining) and other teams summing their scores for a team score.\\r\\nThere are a number of other versions of the rules for Mexican Train, varying the number of dominoes drawn by each player, the rules for playing doubles, or the number of tiles that can be played during one turn. For example:\\r\\nFast Game variation: After the starting double has been placed, turns are ignored, and each player focuses on making their own train as long as possible. Once everyone has made as long of a train as they can, play reverts to turns, using the rules listed above. This speeds up the game, but eliminates some of the strategies of playing doubles.\\r\\nDelayed First Turn variation: Similar to the Fast Game variation listed above, instead of simultaneously, each person takes turns playing as many dominoes on their train as possible. Any player that is unable to play on their first turn draws a domino, and may then begin their first turn or pass. When a player who has passed finally starts their train, they may play as many dominoes as they can string together. After starting their train, players are only permitted to play one domino at a time as usual, unless playing a double. This version allows a player to save their \\"first turn\\" string of dominoes for when they have a chance, instead of being stuck with all dominoes from the beginning.\\r\\nBranching Doubles variation: Once a double has been satisfied, players may continue to branch off of the double in two more directions, meaning the double will have a matching endpoint on all four sides. Often, players like to angle these branches at a 45-degree angle to accommodate for more room. This variant gives players more choice and speeds up the game.\\r\\nSwan Drive variation: A player who can play on their own train may also play one tile on each subsequent public train in clockwise order. Each public train must be played on in order to continue in this manner, and only one tile per train may be played (unless a double must be finished). Once a player cannot play on the next public train, or has looped around to their own train, their turn ends. While playing on each public train, the player may choose to play on the Mexican train or skip it when he comes to it, making the placement of the train somewhat strategical. This version makes for a much faster game.","input":"How many dominoes are in a mexican train set?"},{"output":"\\"The One Where Rachel Smokes\\"","context":"\\"The One Where Rachel Smokes\\" is the eighteenth episode of the fifth season of Friends and 115th overall. It first aired on NBC in the United States on April 8, 1999. In the episode, Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) starts her new job at Ralph Lauren and soon feels left out because all the decision making takes place on smoking breaks and she does not smoke. Rachel attempts to solve the problem by taking up the habit, which proves difficult. Meanwhile, Ben auditions for a soup commercial and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) decides to come along to try for a part as well. When both are paired with different actors, the auditions become competitive. Elsewhere, Monica (Courteney Cox) and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) plan a surprise party for Rachel.\\r\\nThe episode was directed by Todd Holland and written by Michael Curtis. Although Aniston's character Rachel was not a smoker, the actress at the time of filming was, who often said she planned to quit. In its original broadcast, \\"The One Where Rachel Smokes\\" acquired a Nielsen rating of 14.8, finishing the week ranked third.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRoss (David Schwimmer) and Carol (Jane Sibbett) inform the others that their son Ben (Jack and Charlie Allen) has an audition for a soup commercial, which Joey (Matt LeBlanc) finds hard to accept. When he learns that the TV commercial also has a part for the father, he volunteers himself for the audition. Both Joey and Ben are chosen for the callback but a lack of similarity in looks makes the director cast them with different individuals, therefore ensuring only one of them can be chosen for the commercial. Joey is paired up with a famous child actor. He talks to Ross about the callback in an attempt to make Ben back out of the audition which Ross finds unreasonable as it was Ben's audition in the first place, and Joey just invited himself along. Both end up fighting over it, which drags on until the callback is held. Joey messes up his two-word line: \\"mmm soup\\", ultimately losing him the part. Ross consoles him, informing him later that Ben also didn't get the part.\\r\\nOn her first day working at Ralph Lauren, Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) tries to get along with her new colleague and boss, Nancy and Kim. The latter two are smokers, and go on a cigarette break, which Rachel can't join as she doesn't smoke and she is angered to find that Nancy and Kim are busy making company decisions without her during the smoking break. Rachel fears for her position, as Kim and Nancy spend more time together during smoking breaks and have a better chance to bond, and thus Nancy is most probably going to get promotions. To make an effort and bond with her co-workers, Rachel goes with them and smokes a cigarette. She is not enthusiastic to fall into the bad habit and tries to talk Kim and Nancy into quitting which comes to no avail, later catching them smoking behind her back. Kim warns Rachel that she would fire her if she catches her with a cigarette as she doesn't want to \\"drag her down with them\\". She forces Rachel to leave, just as she invites Nancy to go on a business trip to Paris with her.\\r\\nPhoebe (Lisa Kudrow) and Monica (Courteney Cox) organize a surprise party for Rachel one month ahead of her birthday, but Monica's insistence to take responsibility over everything leaves Phoebe with cup and ice duties. However Phoebe vows to get back at Monica. At the party, the apartment is overflowing with decorations and made of cups, and everyone is enjoying the snow cones Phoebe has made with the ice, meaning all of Monica's food is ignored. Rachel arrives home and is very surprised to find the party, given that Chandler's (Matthew Perry) birthday is before hers.\\r\\n\\"The One Where Rachel Smokes\\" was written by Michael Curtis, making it his third writing credit of the season.[1] It was the only episode directed by Todd Holland.[1] Holland worked previously as a director on Tales from the Crypt, Felicity and most notably The Larry Sanders Show, where he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series at the 50th Primetime Emmy Awards.[2] Despite her character's refusal to smoke, Jennifer Aniston at the time of filming was a frequent smoker.[3] She publicly asserted her intention to quit in the past and even turned to hypnosis, with the help from co-star Lisa Kudrow.[3] Joanna Gleason made her first appearance as Rachel's boss Kim Clozzi. She would later appear in the sixth season episode \\"The One With Ross's Teeth\\". \\"The One Where Rachel Smokes\\" marked the final appearance of Charlie and Jack Allen as Ben Geller-Willick-Bunch, who were replaced with Cole Sprouse.[4][5]\\r\\nThe songs \\"Never There\\" by Cake and \\"Jamming\\" by Bob Marley can be heard playing at Rachel's birthday party.[6] At Ben's audition, a copy of Variety magazine is seen being read by a child, whom Carol recognises.[7]\\r\\nIn its original airing, \\"The One Where Rachel Smokes\\" finished third in ratings for the week of April 5 ÿ 11, 1999, with a Nielsen rating of 14.8, equivalent to approximately 14.4 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on NBC that week, after ER and Frasier.[8] The episode premiered in the United Kingdom on Sky1 on May 6, 1999 and attained 1.76 million viewers, making it the most watched program on the network that week.[9]\\r\\nEntertainment Weekly rated the episode \\"C\\", in its review of the fifth season.[10] It cited Chandler's line \\"You've got to push past this, okay? Because it's about to get sooo good\\" as the best of the episode.[10] The review criticized the manner in which an employee can feel pressured into smoking, adding it is \\"not exactly the stuff that laughs are made of\\". Moreover, it argued the same over the competitive vibe between Joey and Ross.[10] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide added in a review of the fifth season DVD: \\"Although I don't like the cutesy kid who plays Ben, the audition bits become funny due to Joeys screw-ups. His inability to correctly read the line \\"mmm ÿ soup!\\" becomes very amusing and offers the show's highlights.\\"[11]\\r\\nThe episode was released as part of Friends: The Complete Fifth Season in Regions 1, 2 and 4.[12] There are two extra scenes included in the DVD: one with Carol at the audition and Chandler at the party attempting to sneak a cigarette.[7]","input":"When did rachel start working at ralph lauren?"},{"output":"Spanish","context":"","input":"What language is spoken in the domincan republic?"},{"output":"the sixth series","context":"Oliver Stanley Murs[1] (born 14 May 1984) is an English singer-songwriter, television presenter and actor.

As of December 2014, Murs has sold over 10 million records worldwide.[2] In May 2011, it was announced that Murs would return to The X Factor to co-present the spin-off show The Xtra Factor with Caroline Flack. His autobiography, Happy Days, was published in October 2012. In November 2012, Murs released his third album Right Place Right Time, and released 6 singles from it; the first, \\"Troublemaker\\", was his fourth number one.\\r\\nOn 16 November 2014, Murs released the single, \\"Wrapped Up\\" featuring Gym Class Heroes' Travie McCoy, which peaked at number 3.

Murs also announced that he would tour the UK in spring 2015. On 15 June, Murs released his fourth single \\"Beautiful to Me\\" in which the music video included Game of Thrones actress Charlotte Hope. On 16 April 2015, it was announced that Murs would be reunited with Flack to replace Dermot O'Leary as co-presenters of The X Factor from series 12. Murs later released his fifth studio album, 24 Hrs, which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMurs was born in Witham, Essex, the son of Vicky-Lynn and Pete Murs.[3][4][5] He has a twin brother, Ben Murs, and a sister, Fay Murs. His paternal grandfather was Latvian, and had moved to the United Kingdom with his parents, Edward and Kathe Murs, in 1948.[6] He attended Howbridge Junior School in Witham and Notley High School in Braintree, Essex[7] where he was a striker in the school's football team.\\r\\nHe went to school with Next of Kin and played semi-professionally for Isthmian Division One North side Witham Town between 2006 and 2008. He excelled for the club's reserve team during the 2006/07 season, scoring 12 goals in 13 appearances and winning the Ridgeons Reserve Teams Cup.[8] He made three first team appearances in the following season, scoring once,[9] but was forced to give up his football career following an injury.[10]\\r\\nPrior to The X Factor, Murs worked as a recruitment consultant at Prime Appointments in Witham, and performed as part of a covers band called the Small Town Blaggers with a friend, Jon Goodey.[11] He also appeared on the game show Deal or No Deal in 2007, where he won S10. Murs returned for a celebrity version of the show in 2012, which made him the only person to appear on it twice. In 2008, he travelled to Australia, backpacking alone along the east coast for three months.[12] It was upon his return that he decided, having tried it out unsuccessfully twice in the past (when he didn't make it past the stage where he had to audition in front of the producers), to audition for The X Factor again.\\r\\nIn 2009, Murs auditioned for the sixth series of The X Factor, performing Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstition\\". Judge Simon Cowell said it was \\"the easiest yes I've ever given\\". At bootcamp Murs sang Elton John's song Your Song. On the first live show, he sang \\"She's the One\\" and on the second, \\"A Fool in Love\\", a performance which Cowell described as being \\"in a different league.\\" For week three he took on \\"Bewitched\\". Walsh commented that he was the \\"dark horse of the competition,\\" and Cowell said he was \\"coming into his own each week.\\" He frequently employed dance moves in his performance including his trademark \\"Olly wiggle.\\"[13] In week 4 he sang \\"Come Together\\" and again received positive comments, with Walsh predicting, \\"I think you're in the final three,\\" and Cowell saying he was \\"progressing better than just about everybody.\\"[14] In week 5 he performed \\"Twist and Shout\\" and in week 6 \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\", after which he was labelled by Minogue as, \\"absolutely the best performer we have on the show by far.\\"[15]\\r\\nIn week 7, after a performance of \\"Fastlove\\", he was in the bottom two with John & Edward. Cowell and Cheryl Cole decided to send John & Edward home, but Louis Walsh voted against Murs. Dannii Minogue then decided against taking the judges' vote to deadlock and sent home John & Edward. However, voting statistics revealed that John & Edward received more votes than Murs meaning if Minogue sent the result to deadlock, John & Edward would've been sent through to the quarter-final and Murs would've been eliminated. To participate in the semi-finals, Murs had to miss his brother's wedding. The ceremony took place just 16 miles (26?km) from the show's studio, but mentor Cowell was against letting him off for a few hours on the crucial semi-final day.[16] He sang \\"Can You Feel It\\" and \\"We Can Work It Out\\" in the semi-final and ended up as one of the three finalists, breaking down on hearing the result.[17]\\r\\nIn the final on 12 December, he repeated his audition song, \\"Superstition\\", following which Cowell said putting him in the final 12 was \\"the best risk I have ever taken in my life\\". Murs then sang with British entertainer Robbie Williams on a duet of \\"Angels\\", in which Williams fluffed his lines as he walked on stage to join Murs and came in at the wrong time, singing the second line of the song, but was helped by Murs to find the right spot.[18] There was then a repeat performance of his week 2 song \\"Fool in Love\\". Murs qualified for the final two and first sang a repeat performance of \\"Twist and Shout\\", following which Walsh commented, \\"You're a born, born showman and no matter what happens tonight you're going to have a great career in music.\\" In his final performance on the show he performed the winner's song, \\"The Climb\\", finishing it in tears.[19] He was told by Cole, \\"You absolutely tore it from your soul. I've never heard you sing like that. I thought it was a beautiful version of the song.\\"[20] He lost the final to Joe McElderry the next day and finished as the runner-up.[21]\\r\\nOn 15 December, two days after the final, it was reported that Cowell was going to offer Murs a record deal in early 2010.[22] Following his defeat, Murs was reportedly texted by duet partner Robbie Williams and invited to visit him in his Los Angeles mansion and participate in the forthcoming Soccer Aid, organised by Williams.[23] Murs performed on the X Factor tour, alongside Joe McElderry, John & Edward, Stacey Solomon, Lucie Jones and several other finalists. It was later revealed on The Xtra Factor that Murs was predicted by all the judges and presenters (except Minogue who had said Nicole Jackson, and Cole who had said Miss Frank as a second choice) as the favourite to win the series at the Boot Camp stage.[24][25] As with all other finalists save the winner, Murs began gigging around the country following the end of the show.[26] He was also booked to appear at the engagement party of model Danielle Lloyd.[27] Footage of Murs appearing on Deal or No Deal was later featured in an edition of the BBC's Almost Famous on 2 January 2010.[28]\\r\\nRumours began that Murs would record a debut album almost immediately after the final, where he finished in second place to Joe McElderry. After the rumours broke out, Murs announced he signed a joint record deal between Epic Records and Syco Music in February 2010.[29] It was announced that Murs began working with John Shanks and Eg White.[30] It was later confirmed that Roy Stride, Trevor Horn, Wayne Hector and Matty Benbrook would have involvement on the album which he collaborated with to make the \\"best possible songs\\".[31] More writers and producers were confirmed to be working with Murs in the studio, including: Phil Thornalley, Martin Brammer, Samuel Preston, Mark Taylor.[32] Chris Difford[32] and Professor Green were due to appear on the album; however, the duet fell through before recording was completed.\\r\\nMurs confirmed the first single from the album to be titled \\"Please Don't Let Me Go\\", which was released on 27 August 2010 following the circulation of the accompanying music video.[33] The song was written by Murs himself and with other songwriters, Claude Kelly and Steve Robson; the single was also produced by Future Cut.[30] The song is about a minor relationship Murs was in where he ended up feeling something for the other person. Murs commented: \\"Sadly she kept giving me the impression that she didn't like me as much, and ultimately it didn't work out, so that's where the idea of me singing 'Please Don't Let Me Go' came from.\\"[34] The song was described as \\"a lovely summery reggae-tinged pop tune that bobs along in a thoroughly hummable and not un-Will Young-like fashion\\" and said that the music video \\"is just as quintessentially pleasant\\".[35] During the release, Murs was told not to get his hopes up for a number-one due to Katy Perry releasing \\"Teenage Dream\\" the same day. On 5 September 2010, the single entered the UK Singles Charts at number 1 beating Katy Perry's \\"Teenage Dream\\". The song was released with the B-side track, entitled \\"This One's for the Girls\\" also entered the UK Singles Charts, debuting at number 69, was written for all of his female fans.\\r\\nHis debut album was released in November 2010;[36] which was a self-titled album, Olly Murs. The album's tracking list was revealed on 15 October 2010.[37] The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number two, with the biggest week-one album sales for a debut album in 2010, with over 108,000 albums sold.[38] The album also charted on the Irish Albums Chart where it found itself peaking at number eleven. The second single was \\"Thinking of Me\\",[39] written by Murs, Steve Robson and Hector, and co-produced by Future Cut and Steve Robson.[40] It was released on 19 November 2010,[39] prior to the album's release.[32] It was reported that Professor Green would feature on the single;[41] however, the duet fell through before it was completed.[42] The single was added to BBC Radio 1's C Playlist on 3 November 2010. Murs performed the single for the first time on The X Factor. Upon the release the single charted at number four on the UK Singles Charts and thirteen on the Irish Singles Charts. On 13 November Murs turned the Christmas lights on in Paisley and he also turned on the Christmas lights near his hometown in Chelmsford, Essex. Renfrewshire Council was criticised in the media for the S15,000 fee that Murs was paid to turn on the lights, after announcing that they were axing 500 jobs. Murs however donated his fee for his appearance at this event.[43]\\r\\nTwo further singles were released from the first album into 2011 ÿ the James Morrison penned \\"Heart on My Sleeve\\", which charted at No. 20 in March 2011, and \\"Busy\\" which charted at No. 45 in June 2011. Murs completed a theatre tour for his first album in spring 2011, commencing on 26 April in Rhyl at the Pavilion Theatre and playing four sold out nights at London's Hammersmith Apollo in late May. He also toured as the support act of JLS on their summer stadium tour.\\r\\nIt was rumoured in June 2011, that Murs had started working on his second studio album, which he later confirmed. Murs claimed that he would \\"take the album from a different approach\\", and claimed he would like to record a rap track, stating, \\"I'm secretly not a bad rapper, I really like to do a bit of beat boxing, Eminem is always a favourite, or maybe Vanilla Ice, \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" is a classic.\\"[44] Murs revealed that he will attempt to build himself a more of a \\"soulful\\" sound through writing the second album, and also expressed interest in recording with English entertainer Robbie Williams after the two met on The X Factor Live Final.[45] Murs confirmed in July 2011, that the lead single from the album would be called \\"Heart Skips a Beat\\", and it would feature up-and-coming Brithop Rap duo Rizzle Kicks.[46] He described it as a \\"parallel\\" to the remainder of the album, calling it a \\"summer party song\\".[45] The song premiered on The Chris Moyles Show on 7 July 2011 and has since been well received by fans.[47] The video for the track was later released via Murs' official YouTube channel. Murs said that the song is one of his favourite tracks from the new album, stating, \\"I'm loving the tune at the moment. It's going down really, really well.\\"[46] \\"Heart Skips a Beat\\" later peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, marking his second number one. It later went on to peak at number one in Germany and Switzerland, also reaching top ten in numerous countries in Europe.\\r\\nIn September 2011, Murs announced via Twitter that his second album would be entitled In Case You Didn't Know, taken from a song of the same name which appears on the album.[48] On 14 October 2011, Murs released the audio of \\"Dance with Me Tonight\\", the album's second single, via his YouTube Channel. The track was released on 21 November 2011, again peaking at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. The album, In Case You Didn't Know was released a week later on 28 November 2011. The album peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart, two on the Irish Charts, and in the top ten in Germany, Switzerland and Poland. Murs confirmed via his Twitter account in February 2012 that the album's third single would be \\"Oh My Goodness\\", and that it would be released on 2 April. It peaked at No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was his second release in Europe after \\"Heart Skips a Beat\\", released on 10 August, and has so far peaked in the top 40 in Germany and Austria.\\r\\nIn April 2012, it was revealed that Murs was in the process of writing his third studio album, which was released on 26 November 2012. Murs has once again written with Steve Robson and Claude Kelly. Ed Drewett (best known for his work for The Wanted) and Andrew Frampton and Steve Kipner (producers of both albums for The Script) are other names that have been confirmed for the third album, and in a June 2012 interview with the website Examiner he confirmed the name of a new song, \\"One of These Days\\", which he described as a 'follow-on' song from \\"I Need You Now\\" on his previous album.[49] On 17 September, Murs announced the first single from his third album, \\"Troublemaker\\", a collaboration with Claude Kelly and Steve Robson which features American rapper Flo Rida and was released on 18 November. It also served as Murs's second U.S. single. The same day, he also announced the name of the third album, Right Place Right Time.[50] The cover artwork and track listing for the album was unveiled on 1 October. Murs will be embarking on a second arena tour of the UK and Ireland in February/March 2013 to support the album, as well as performing his first live European dates in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark in April 2013. On 14 January 2013 Murs confirmed that the second single from the album would be \\"Army of Two\\", which was released on 10 March 2013. The album's third single, \\"Dear Darlin'\\", was released on 3 June 2013. On 25 August 2013, the album's title track \\"Right Place Right Time\\" was released as the fourth single.\\r\\nMurs was the opening act for English boy band One Direction on the North American leg of their Up All Night Tour, which began on 29 May in Toronto.[51] \\"Heart Skips a Beat\\" was released as Murs' first U.S. single through Columbia Records on 29 May 2012, replacing Rizzle Kicks with American rappers Chiddy Bang for its release. As of September 2012 it has peaked at No. 96 on the Billboard Hot 100. Murs was set to release 'In Case You Didn't Know' as his debut U.S. album on 25 September 2012, also through Columbia, however Examiner.com reported on 2 September that the release had been 'postponed until further notice', with no definite new release date given. On 17 September, Columbia then confirmed a new release date of 3 December and that they would now be releasing Murs' third UK album, Right Place Right Time as his debut U.S. release instead.

Key figures who changed and influenced the course of Abercrombie & Fitch's history include co-founders David T. Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Limited Brands and Michael Jeffries, the former Chairman and CEO.[1]\\r\\nDavid Abercrombie founded A&F in 1892 as an upscale sporting goods store. Forming a partnership with Ezra Fitch, the company continued to expand in the new 20th century. After Abercrombie left the company, Fitch became sole owner and ushered in the \\"Fitch Years\\" of continued success. Shortly after his retirement, the company continued to develop under a succession of other leaders until its financial fall and closing in 1977. Limited Brands purchased the ailing brand in 1988 and brought in Mike Jeffries, who revolutionized the image of Abercrombie & Fitch to become an upscale youthful fashion retailer. Today, the company is a multibillion-dollar entity continuing to experience economic expansion through the business continuance of three offshoot growing concepts and cautious international expansion into key luxury markets.\\r\\nProminent figures who patronized the company in its excursion goods days of the early 20th century include Teddy Roosevelt,[2] Amelia Earhart,[2][3] Greta Garbo,[2] Katharine Hepburn,[2] Clark Gable,[2] John Steinbeck,[4][5] John F. Kennedy,[5] Ernest Shackleton,[6] Cole Porter,[7] and Dwight Eisenhower.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company was originally established as Abercrombie Co. by David Abercrombie on June 4, 1892, in a small waterfront shop at 36 South Street in downtown Manhattan, New York. Wealthy New York businessman Ezra Fitch became one of the store's regular customers. In 1900, Fitch bought a major share in the growing Abercrombie Company and thus joined as co-founder. Abercrombie Co. later moved into larger quarters at 314 Broadway, and Fitch began to implement experimental ideas to renovate the store. In 1904, Fitch's surname was added to Abercrombie's and so the official name became Abercrombie & Fitch Co.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe partnership between Abercrombie and Fitch did not end happily. The two men, with different visions for the future of A&F, quarreled frequently, although the company continued to prosper. Fitch wished to expand the company's appeal to the general public, while Abercrombie wanted to continue selling professional gear to professional outdoorsmen.[8] As a result of the disagreement, Abercrombie sold his share in the company to Fitch in 1907 and returned to manufacturing outdoor goods.[9] Fitch continued the business with other partners and directed the company as he pleased.\\r\\nIn 1909, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. mailed over 50,000 copies of its 456-page catalog worldwide (a staggering and costly amount of publication at that time, since each cost a dollar to produce).[10] The catalog featured outdoor clothing, camping gear, articles, and advice columns. The cost of the catalog nearly bankrupted the company, but the catalog proved to be a profitable marketing device. Within the store, the catalog was available to customers for free. By 1910, the company began selling women's clothing,[9] and became the first store in New York to supply clothing to women as well as men.[citation needed] In 1913, after moving into Reade Street, which was not a convenient shopping location for women, the store relocated to a more fashionable and easily accessible midtown address near Fifth Avenue at 55/57 West 36th Street, expanding its inventory to include sportswear. In 1917, the store moved again into a twelve-story building at the corner of Madison Avenue and East 45th Street.[11] The store occupied the entire available space (12 stories). Mr. Abercrombie was a farmer who thought clothes during the 19th century were boring. He became famous with his best friend Mr. Fitch. They then created Abercrombie and Fitch.\\r\\nThe Madison Avenue store included many different amenities. The basement housed a shooting range while on the mezzanine (main floor) paraphernalia for skiing, archery, free diving, and lawn games were sold. The second through fifth floors were reserved for clothing that was suitable for different climate or terrains. On the sixth floor were a picture gallery, a bookstore (focused on sporting themes), a watch repair facility and a golf school (fully equipped with a resident professional). The seventh floor included a gun room with hundreds of shotguns and rifles, decorated with stuffed game heads, as well as a kennel for dogs and cats .[11] The eighth floor contained fishing, camping, and boating equipment and included a desk for a fly- and bait-casting instructor who gave lessons at the pool, which was located on the roof. The fishing section alone was stocked with over 48,000 flies and over 18,000 fishing lures.[11]\\r\\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. became the first American store to import Mahjong.[12] Ezra Fitch imported the game after a female customer looked for the game that she had played in China. He went to China for the game and translated the instructions into English. Mahjong became a fast selling product, and Abercrombie & Fitch became the epicenter of the Mahjong craze.[10] The company sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy as many Mahjong sets as possible and eventually sold over 12,000 sets.\\r\\nIn 1927, Abercrombie & Fitch outfitted Charles Lindbergh for his historic flight across the Atlantic Ocean.[13] It also attracted the business of other prominent figures.[14]\\r\\nIn 1928, Fitch retired from the company and sold to his brother-in-law, James S. Cobb.[9][10] Under Cobb, A&F acquired Von Lengerke & Detmold, a well-respected New York dealer of fine European-made sporting guns and fishing tackle, as well as that company's Chicago branch, Von Lengerke & Antoine. Cobb also acquired Griffin & Howe, another gunsmith company. Merchandise from both Von Lengerke & Detmold and Griffin & Howe was carried at A&F's Madison Avenue store.[10] By this time, A&F was also selling equipment for polo, golf, and tennis.[10] By 1929, sales of US $6.3 million were reported with net profits of US $548,000.[10]\\r\\nDuring the Great Depression, the company's revenue decreased and it stopped paying dividends. Sales plunged to $2,598,925 in 1933. A&F recovered in the following years and resumed paying dividends in 1938.[10] During that year, guns accounted for 40% of sales at the Madison Avenue store.[10] Clothing, shoes, and furnishings accounted for 45%, while inventory was valued at about 40% of annual sales (reflecting A&F's readiness to meet customer demands).[10] Ten percent of the business was attributed to mail orders from the catalog.[10] Abercrombie & Fitch Co. continued to expand. As early as 1913, A&F had adopted the slogan, \\"The Greatest Sporting Goods Store in the World\\".[10]\\r\\nA&F's record net profit was $682,894 in 1947.[10] The company opened a large branch in San Francisco in 1958. It soon added small winter-only shops open from November through May each season in Palm Beach and Sarasota, Florida and summer-only shops in Bay Head, New Jersey, and Southampton, New York.[10] to complement a shop in Hyannis, Massachusetts it had operated since the end of World War II. Guernsey succeeded Cobb as president.[10] He remarked, \\"The Abercrombie & Fitch type does not care about the cost; he wants the finest quality.\\"[10] With so many locations now under the control of Abercrombie & Fitch, the Madison Avenue store remained the flagship store.[10] In the 1950s, the main floor of the flagship was remodeled to include heads of buffalo, caribou, moose, elk, and other big game, stuffed fish of spectacular size, and elephant's-foot wastebaskets.[10]\\r\\nIn 1960, net sales rose to $16.5 million, but net profit fell for the fourth straight year to $185,649.[10] By 1961, net sales dropped to $15.5 million, and net profit to $124,097. Guernsey's successor as president, John H. Ewing, paid little attention to the decline in sales.[10] In 1961, he told an interviewer of Business Week that Abercrombie & Fitch enjoyed a special niche \\"by sticking to our knitting; by not trying to be all things to all people.\\"[10] A&F would open a year-round resort shop at The Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs (1962) and its first suburban store at the Mall in Short Hills, New Jersey (1963). Under the leadership of Earle K. Angstadt, Jr., Abercrombie's continued to expand in upscale locations such as the Bal Harbour Shops near Miami Beach, Florida (1966), the Somerset Mall in Troy, Michigan, outside Detroit (1969) and in boutique-style shops in other department stores.[10]\\r\\nIn 1964, Abercrombie and Fitch achieved a notable early example of the \\"brand integration\\" form of product placement by providing the venue for part of the Rock Hudson / Paula Prentiss romantic comedy film Man's Favorite Sport?.\\r\\nAbercrombie and Fitch held a warehouse sale in 1968 and early 1970 and presented offbeat newspaper advertisements that reflected a measure of desperation.[10] The company's revenue continued decline, with a loss of about $500,000 in its previous fiscal year. Noticing the effect that the ads and sale-days had upon the Abercrombie & Fitch customer base, the next president William Humphreys, a former Lord & Taylor executive, halted the measures.[10] He focused on improving A&F's inventory control and credit practices and cutting the company's expenses.;[10] changed the store design to present a different image, focused on expansion into the suburbs in 1972 with a location in Oak Brook, Illinois 1972 in hopes of recapturing customers who no longer patronized its store in downtown Chicago's Loop.[10] Noticing that the offbeat advertisements were bringing in customers that management considered \\"not of classic Abercrombie & Fitch material,\\" A&F ceased its mis-directing ads and sale-days in October 1970.[10] Presentation within the flagship changed as well to provide a newer look. Expensive sailboats were moved from the main floor to an upper floor, a discount clothing section was introduced on the tenth floor, sportswear lines were expanded, and new buyers for woman's apparel were hired.[10] However, the changes did not improve sales and the company continued to decline financially under Humphreys and his successor Hal Haskell, who was a major stockholder of the company.[10] After losing $1 million in 1975, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 1976 and finally closed its doors in November 1977.[15]\\r\\nOshman's, a sporting goods retailer, acquired Abercrombie & Fitch Co. in 1978 for $1.5 million[16][17] ($5.2 million in 2013 dollars).[18] It opened an Abercrombie & Fitch store in 1979 in Beverly Hills, California, and another in Dallas, Texas, which was bigger and sported $40,000 USD elephant guns and an \\"Abercrombie Runabout sports convertible\\" worth $20,775 USD.[10] Stores continued to open in South Street Seaport and Trump Tower and catered towards contemporary interests of golf, exercise, and tennis.[10] Clothing collections for men and women carried business and casual dress, and sportswear.[10] Forbes described the merchandise as \\"a hodgepodge of unrelated items\\" and that \\"sometimes it is better to bury the dead than to try reviving them.\\" Abercrombie & Fitch continued to struggle as Oshman's struggled itself to develop a strong identity for the company.[11]\\r\\nIn 1988, Limited Brands acquired the ailing company for $47 million after having success in popularizing Express and Victoria's Secret.[19] Headquarters was moved to Columbus, Ohio, and all inventory was cleared out.[10] The new president of Abercrombie & Fitch, Sally Frame-Kasaks, placed a strong emphasis on apparel.[16] Michael S. Jeffries, a clothing executive, took over as president in 1992.[7][20] He popularized the brand to a teen apparel merchandiser from an ailing sports brand. He believed that focusing the A&F brand towards the American teen market would be financially beneficial as that sector of retail economy was said to be growing at a record rate at the time.[21]\\r\\nThe new Abercrombie & Fitch reopened shortly afterwords with a preppy outdoors theme reminiscent of the company's original roots.[21] Jeffries desired to have Bruce Weber, known for his sexual beefcake photography, as the photographer for the brand, but could not do so until the company gained financial success. The apparel consisted of woven shirts, denim, miniskirts, cargo shorts, wool sweaters, polo shirts, and t-shirts. Its prices were unprecedentedly high in the teen apparel industry.[21] Sales rose $85 million in 1992, $111 million in 1993, and to $165 million in 1994.[10][20] 49 stores were opened by 1994, and a 102 store count was aimed by the end of 1995.[10] In 1994, new records for merchandise margin rate and profitability were established by Abercrombie & Fitch for its parent, The Limited.[21] To maintain popularity and to keep up with teen trends, Jeffries hired executives to keep up on popular teenage clothing, music, and entertainment.[21]\\r\\nBy the mid-1990s, there were dozens of Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the United States.[22] On September 26, 1996, The Limited, Inc. took Abercrombie & Fitch public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol \\"ANF\\" and with the per share offering as $16.[23] In late 1990s, the company began to opt building stores only averaging between 8,000 and 20,000 square feet (700 to 2,000 m2) in high-volume retail centers around the country. It also launched the canoe store prototype of white facade and interior gray walls to accommodate the growth of its brand.\\r\\nIn 1997, Abercrombie & Fitch launched A&F Quarterly. The publication included photography, interviews and articles about sex, pop culture, and other teen interests.[21] In 1998, the company introduced its first subsidiary, abercrombie. The concept was designed as the Abercrombie & Fitch for a younger clientele between the ages on 7-14. In 1999 began a 3-year-long class action lawsuit in which Abercrombie & Fitch was one of several American retailers involved for its sweatshops in Saipan.[24] Revenue recorded for Abercrombie & Fitch at the end of fiscal 1998 was at $805.2 million USD. By 1998, Abercrombie & Fitch became an independent company, and Mike Jeffries assumed the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.[7] As the brand regained its prominence, industry analysts began to speculate how long Abercrombie and Fitch would be able to retain its popularity.[21]\\r\\nAnalysts predicted that A&F would fall from popularity, but sales continued escalating after a provocative Christmas 1999 in which the A&F Quarterly issue of the season featured sexually explicit content that drew angry complaints.[21] In 1999, the A&F also launched \\"A&F TV\\", which featured young people engaged in sports and leisure activities. A&F TV was originally developed to run on cable television and on monitors in Abercrombie & Fitch stores. It was soon removed. Revenue for fiscal 1999 was at  $1.030 billion USD.\\r\\nThe overall approach of Abercrombie & Fitch, by the end of the decade, to its customers seemed to please male shoppers more than females, who shopped more frequently at competitor shops.[21] Throughout the 1990s, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. enjoyed sales of over $400/ft2 ($4300/m2). By December 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch operated a total of 212 stores nationwide.[25]\\r\\nEntering into the 21st century, Abercrombie & Fitch was rated as the sixth most popular brand before Nintendo and Levi's by teenagers.[26] The company introduced its third brand, Hollister Co., in July 2000. The third concept was based on Southern California surf lifestyle, and was targeted towards high school students. After Hollister lowered the revenue of Abercrombie & Fitch, the company launched the Ezra Fitch collection, and began producing A&F clothing with higher grade materials, increasing the prices. In 2001, the company moved into a new 300-acre (1.2?km2) home office in New Albany, Ohio. Headquarters were further expanded by 2003.[27] Also in 2003, the company released its last issue of A&F Quarterly after amounting complaints.\\r\\nAfter successfully launching Hollister, the company introduced its fourth brand RUEHL No.925 for older consumers, 22 through 35, on September 24, 2004.[28] Revenue continued to escalate as sales are reported at $2.021 billion for 2004. In November 2005, the company opened doors to its first ever flagship store (located in Fifth Avenue). By this time, the company begins to uplift its image to near-luxury status after introducing the trademark Casual Luxury for promotion. Revenue reported for 2005 was $2.021 billion.[29]\\r\\nAbercrombie & Fitch began its Canadian expansion in January 2006 when the company opened two A&F stores and three Hollister Co. stores in Toronto and Edmonton.[30] By fall 2006, a third Canadian Abercrombie & Fitch store opened in the Toronto Eaton Centre. Also in the year, the brand opened a west coast flagship in The Grove.[31] Revenue reported for 2006 is $3.318 billion, an increase of over $1.297 billion from 2005.\\r\\nBeginning 2007, the canoe stores were revamped with dark louvers (see right image). On 22 March 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch opened its first European flagship in London at 7 Burlington Gardens in Savile Row.[32] The store generated a volume of $280,000 (around S140,000 GBP) in its first 6 hours of operation.[6][33] The flagship remains one of the most profitable A&F locations. Revenue reached record heights in 2007 with an overall sales of $3.749 billion.\\r\\nOn 21 January 2008, Abercrombie & Fitch introduced its fifth concept, the intimate apparel brand Gilly Hicks.[34] Inspired by \\"Down Under\\", it is officially labeled as the \\"Cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch.\\" In April 2008, A&F relaunched A&F Quarterly for release in the UK flagship.[35][36] On August 31, 2008, the \\"bright and insightful\\" company director Allan A. Tuttle died.[37] By December 22, corporate announced that it had produced a new employment agreement with Mike Jeffries set to expire in 2014.[38] For the first time in its recent history, A&F suffered a financial decrease to $3.540 billion revenue for fiscal 2008. The blame was to the current economic recession, and also to the fact that the company refused to lower price points and offer sales citing brand image-protection that doing so would \\"cheapen\\" its near-luxury image.\\r\\nAs the late-2000s recession continued, A&F noticeably suffered financially for its refusal to lower prices or offer discounts. Early in January 2009, the company reported its worst drop in sales and shares.[39][40] By the end of the month, 50 employees lost their jobs and many positions were still unoccupied.[41] 170 more employees were dismissed in May.[42] A&F announced on 17 June 2009 the closure of its ailing Ruehl No.925 brand by January 2010.[43] By October, A&F launched its official Facebook page. Despite financial downturns, A&F opened its second European location, a flagship store, in Milan on October 29.[44] On its official Facebook page, A&F called it the biggest consumer reception for a flagship opening in A&F history: \\"like nothing the world has seen before\\". On December 15, another flagship store opened in Tokyo, Japan. Marking the first ever A&F location in Asia, the opening became the biggest retail event in history, was noted as a \\"spectacle of consumerism\\" by the Japanese, and made around JP50 million (US$550,000) that day alone.[45][46][47]\\r\\nIn January 2010, A&F launched its A&F Cares feature highlighting its philanthropic efforts. Keeping to its commitment, the company shut down ruehl.com on January 22, and closed doors to all final Ruehl stores by the end of the month. Analysts began noting encouraging signs of financial progress, in March, for the company, citing A&F's successful international expansion and better inventory management.[48] Also around that time, a historical fishing line dryer, made by A&F in the early 1900s, was sold to an A&F model for $590 USD.[49][50] As a marketing move, A&F announced the relaunch of the A&F Quarterly on 17 July 2010 as a part of its \\"Screen Test\\" Back-to-School marketing campaign designed to attract more consumer attention and sales.[51] In August, CEO Mike Jeffries announced that Abercrombie & Fitch would close roughly 60 stores in 2010.[52] Later that month, CFO Jonathan Ramsden said another 50 stores could close in 2011.[52] Profits began to pick up by September 2010 to larger than predicted results (attributted to the result of the major \\"Screen Test\\" campaign and numerous sales held throughout the season).[53] By October, the company was stated as being well ahead its competitors (a first since the economic turndown).[54] The brand opened a flagship in Copenhagen and Fukuoka in November 2010, and another one in Paris by May 2011.\\r\\nOn February 15, 2012, A&F announced plans to close 180 more underperforming U.S. stores by 2015 while continuing to expand in Europe and Asia.[55]\\r\\nIn 2013, the company's trendy, upscale image took a hit when comments made by Jeffries in 2006 that disparaged customers with body types that do not resemble Abercrombie & Fitch models resurfaced. The resulting backlash launched a viral internet campaign called \\"Fitch the Homeless\\", which aimed to subvert and mock the company's carefully manicured image of \\"exclusionary\\" style by distributing used Abercrombie & Fitch clothes to homeless and needy persons.[56]\\r\\nNotes","input":"Where was the first abercrombie and fitch store?"},{"output":"the Mississippi River","context":"Illinois is in the midwestern United States. Surrounding states are Wisconsin to the north, Iowa and Missouri to the west, Kentucky to the south, and Indiana to the east. Illinois also borders Michigan, but only via a northeastern water boundary in Lake Michigan. Nearly the entire western boundary is the Mississippi River, except for a few areas where the river has changed course. Illinois' southeastern and southern boundary is along the Wabash River and the Ohio River. Whereas, its northern boundary and much of its eastern boundary are straight survey (longitudinal and latitudinal) lines. Illinois has a maximum north-south distance of 390 miles (630 km) and 210 miles (340 km) east-west. Its total area is 57,918 square miles (150,010?km2).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIllinois has three major geographical divisions: Northern, Central, and Southern. Collectively, central and southern Illinois are often referred to within Illinois as \\"downstate Illinois\\" but with political developments since World War II \\"Downstate\\" now generally refers to all of Illinois outside of the Chicago metro area.\\r\\nThe first is Northern Illinois, dominated by the Chicago metropolitan area, including the city of Chicago, its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. The \\"collar counties\\" are the five counties that surround the centrally located Cook County in the Chicago metropolitan area: DuPage County, Kane County, Lake County, McHenry County, and Will County.[1] The term \\"Chicagoland\\" is sometimes used to describe the metro area, including Chicago, its suburbs within Cook County, and the so-called collar counties. The term is said to have been coined by Chicago Tribune publisher Robert R. McCormick.[1] The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce defines it as all of Cook, and DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties.[2] The region is cosmopolitan, densely populated, industrialized, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups.\\r\\nAs defined by the federal government, the Chicago Metropolitan Area includes two counties in Indiana, two counties in Wisconsin, and the following 11 counties in Illinois: Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake, LaSalle, McHenry, and Will counties.\\r\\nIn extreme northwestern Illinois the Driftless Zone, a region of unglaciated and therefore higher and more rugged topography, occupies a small part of the state. Charles Mound, located in this region, is the state's highest elevation above sea level.\\r\\nSouthward and westward, the second major division is Central Illinois, an area of mostly flat prairie with the exception of areas along the Illinois and Mississippi rivers that are steeped in hills and bluffs hanging high above the rivers providing commanding views for miles. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the Military Tract of 1812 and forms the distinctive western bulge of state. Central Illinois is characterized by small towns and mid-sized cities. Agriculture, particularly corn and soybeans, figures prominently. Major cities include Peoria, and Springfield (the state capital), also in the south of this region is the State's former capitol, Vandalia. The Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area is located in the central region of the state and is composed of (Champaign, Ford, and Piatt) counties.[4]\\r\\nThe third division is Southern Illinois, comprising the area south of U.S. Route 50, and including Little Egypt, near the juncture of the Mississippi River and Ohio River. This region can be distinguished from the other two by its warmer climate, different mix of crops (including cotton farming in the past), more rugged unglaciated topography, as well as small-scale oil deposits and coal mining.\\r\\nThe population in southern Illinois is concentrated in two areas:\\r\\nThe Shawnee Hills arise in southern Illinois. Illinoian Stage, about 132,000 to 300,000 years before present, climbed the northern face of the Shawnee Hills, but did not reach the summit. Most of the Shawnee Hills is therefore unglaciated.\\r\\nThe floodplain on the Mississippi River from Alton to the Kaskaskia River is the American Bottom, and is the site of the ancient city of Cahokia, and was a region of early French settlement, as well as the site of the first state capital, at Kaskaskia. The extreme southern tip of Illinois is in the Gulf Coastal Plain.\\r\\nThe city of Chicago and some of its older suburbs are heavily Democratic. While this tendency has historically been balanced by Republican voters in the suburbs, Democrats have significantly increased their suburban support in the past decade. Central Illinois's largely rural character helps to sustain a largely Republican voting pattern and widespread antipathy toward Chicago. The combination of poorer soil, coal mining and industrialization has caused the southern region to lean Democratic politically, especially in the urbanized region around Saint Louis, Missouri.\\r\\nRockford, Illinois is known as a center of liberal \\"gypsy moth\\" Republicans.\\r\\nIllinois is predominantly covered with soil, hundreds of feet thick in many places. Much of this soil is called, appropriately, \\"Illite\\", and is the most common type of soil on the planet. The visible geology of the state is mainly Quaternary, with rocks buried deeply. The wealth of the state mainly arises from this abundance of soil and the favorable agrarian conditions it provides.\\r\\nIllinois is a major coal-producing state. Much of the bedrock surface is of Pennsylvanian age, including \\"cyclothemes\\", regular sequences of limestone, shale and coal layers. Newer rocks may have once existed in the State, but these have been removed by repeated epochs of glaciation. Only tiny areas of newer bedrock exist. The chance of finding dinosaur bones in Illinois is almost nil:[citation needed], the Pennsylvanian rocks were here before the dinosaurs.\\r\\nGalena, a lead ore, has been mined in the northwest corner of the state. The ore was processed around Peru, Illinois, where river transport was available to bring the ore to a source of coal. About six tons of coal are needed for each ton of ore.\\r\\nFluorite, calcium fluoride, is the state mineral. It is mined in the southeastern portion of the state, around Metropolis. Fluorine gas is produced from fluorite. This is used in the production of uranium hexafluoride in Metropolis, Illinois for use at the gaseous diffusion plant in Paducah, Kentucky.\\r\\nGeodes can be found in the older Mississippian outcroppings along the Mississippi River.\\r\\nIgneous intrusions are found in the far southern areas of the State. Ages ago North America began to split roughly along the lines of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Igneous rock flowed up into fissures, as a new ocean began to form. Had this continued, Illinois might have resembled the Arabian Peninsula, a broken terrain between two continents. This split, however, failed: the continent reclosed, leaving only a few igneous intrusions, and some oil fields, as evidence that it happened.\\r\\nNorth of the Illinois River the bedrock surface is much older Ordovician sandstone. This sandstone yields ancient sand that is very useful in the production of glass, and in making molds for metal castings.\\r\\nThe majority of Illinois surface bedrock belongs to the Pennsylvanian period, particularly the downstate region. About 68% of the state has coal-bearing strata of this geologic period. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, 211 billion tons of bituminous coal are estimated to lie under the surface, having a total heating value greater than the estimated oil deposits in the Arabian Peninsula. However, this coal has a high sulfur content and as such requires special equipment to reduce air pollution.\\r\\nIllinois is mainly bounded by rivers, and the Illinois River bisects the state. A few rivers, including the Fox and Rock Rivers enter the State from Wisconsin. The Iroquois and Kankakee arise in Indiana, but lose their identity before reaching the Mississippi. The North Fork of the Vermilion River arises in Indiana, but joins the Vermilion, which exits the state before joining the Wabash River in Indiana. Other rivers include the Ohio River, the Kaskaskia River, the Sangamon River and the Chicago River.\\r\\nSubsurface water is generally plentiful in Illinois. However, irregular gravel deposits from glaciation can lead to difficulties predicting depth of the water table.\\r\\nThe Mahomet Aquifer is a large aquifer used as a source for public water supply by many communities in Central Illinois.\\r\\nLarge mammal species currently found in Illinois include whitetail deer and coyote, with the latter becoming urbanized in the Chicago area, as well as common in the rural areas. Furbearers commonly found include opossum, raccoon, mink, red and gray foxes, and muskrat. Commonly seen lagomorphs include the cottontail rabbit and commonly seen rodents include squirrels. Game birds found include Canada goose, mallard duck, ruffed grouse, wild turkey, and bobwhite quail. The northern cardinal is the official state bird. The state has approximately 300 species of birds, many of which migrate on the Mississippi Flyway. Extensive wetland restoration along the Mississippi River and Illinois River are attracting many species.\\r\\nAbout two thirds of the state was originally prairie, with much of the area converted to rowcrop farming, while the southern third of the state remains heavily forested with oak, hickory, and maple. Also, several prairie plants.\\r\\nEspecially in the northern third of the state, intensive agriculture has made some species rare, while population numbers are increasing in the less-developed south. Large mammals generally no longer found in the wild in Illinois include American bison, gray wolf, American black bear, and elk.\\r\\nIllinois has a continental climate, with large temperature extremes not moderated by either mountains or oceans. Weather is influenced primarily by cold Canadian Arctic air in the winter, and warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico in the summer. High temperatures in the south of the state are about 10 to 12?F. warmer than the north. Average annual temperature is 47?F. in the north and 58?F. in the south. Temperatures greater than 90?F. occur about 45 days per year in the south, and 12 days per year in the north. Temperatures below zero F. occur one day or less per year in the south, and 12 days per year in the north. Annual rainfall is 34 inches (860?mm) in the north and 46 inches (1,200?mm) in the south.\\r\\nPrevailing winds are from the west. Average wind speeds \\"blowing off the prairie\\" are greater in the Chicago area. Statewide, the wind speeds average 8 to 12 miles per hour (13 to 19?km/h), and is greater in the winter than in summer.\\r\\nSnowfall averages 30 inches (760?mm) in the north and 10 inches (250?mm) in the south, although the actual snowfalls vary greatly by year. In some years, southern Illinois receives very little snowfall, and may never get typical winter weather.\\r\\nMost of the state has four distinct seasons. The southernmost part of the state is heavily forested and the trees are noted for having beautiful fall colors.\\r\\nTornadoes are a common hazard, primarily in the central part of the state, with peak months in June and April. Freezing rain is most common in central Illinois.\\r\\nThe Mississippi River is the nominal western boundary of the state, except for locations where the river has changed course. Kaskaskia, Illinois, the first state capital, is now west of the river. The Mississippi, due to a flood, destroyed the old town of Kaskaskia, and occupies what was the lower channel of the Kaskaskia River. A portion of Missouri is east of the river, near Grand Tower, Illinois. Similar \\"avulsions\\" are found along the Ohio River border with Kentucky and the Wabash River border with Indiana.","input":"What river is the western border of the state illinois?"},{"output":"January 24, 1984","context":"","input":"In what year did apple introduce the macintosh computer?"},{"output":"Christianity","context":"Religion in Ukraine (Razumkov 2016 survey)[1]\\r\\nReligion in Ukraine is diverse, with a majority of the population adhering to Christianity. A 2016 survey conducted by the Razumkov Centre found that 70% of the population declared themselves believers. About 65.4% of the population declared to be adherents of various types of Orthodoxy (25% Orthodoxy of the Kievan Patriarchate, 21.2% just Orthodox, 15% Orthodoxy of the Moscovian Patriarchate, 1.8% Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, and 2% other types of Orthodoxy), 7.1% just Christians, 6.5% Greek Rite Catholics, 1.9% Protestants, 1.1% Muslims and 1.0% Latin Rite Catholics. Judaism and Hinduism were the religions of 0.2% of the population each. A further 16.3% declared to be non-religious or did not identify in those religions listed hitherto.[1] According to the surveys conducted by Razumkov in the 2000s and early 2010s, such proportions have remained relatively constant throughout the last decade, while the proportion of believers overall has decreased from 76% in 2014 to 70% in 2016.[1] (p.?22).\\r\\nAs of 2016, Christianity is particularly strong in westernmost Ukrainian regions, where most Greek Catholics live besides the Orthodox population. In central, southern and eastern regions, Christians constitute a smaller proportion of the total population, particularly low in the easternmost region of Donbass.[1] Another religion that is present in Ukraine besides Christianity is Rodnovery (Slavic native faith), which is significantly influent in the country and comprises Ukrainian- and Russian-language communities (some Rodnover organizations call the religion 楰־־' Pravoslavya, \\"Right-piety\\"/\\"Orthodoxy\\", thus functioning in homonymy with Christian Orthodox churches).[2][3] Hinduism has been spread after the collapse of the Soviet Union by Indian and International Society for Krishna Consciousness' missionaries and is particularly present in the Donbass region.[1] Crimean Tatars professing Islam represent a significant part of the population in Crimea, which prior 2014 was a subject of Ukraine, but has been since that year a subject of Russia. As of 2016, without Crimea, where Muslims formed 15% of the population in 2013,[4] only Donbass maintains a larger community of Muslims compared to other Ukrainian regions (6%).[1]\\r\\nA 2006 survey of the same Razumkov Center found that: 62.5% of all respondents were unaware of their religious affiliation, not religious or not affiliated to any religious body, 33.6% were Christians (26.8% Orthodox, 5.9% Catholics, and 0.9% Protestants), 0.1% were Jewish, and 3.8% were members of other religions.[5]\\r\\nSince before the outbreak of the War in Donbass in 2014, but even more violently so from that year onwards, there has been unrest between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian religious groups in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pre-historic times and in the early Middle Ages, the territories of present-day Ukraine supported different tribes practising their traditional pagan religions (though note for example the Tengrism of Old Great Bulgaria in the Ukrainian lands in the 7th century CE). Byzantine-rite Christianity first became prominent about the turn of the first millennium. (Later traditions and legends relate that in the first century CE the Apostle Andrew himself had visited the site where the city of Kiev would later arise.[7])\\r\\nIn the 10th century the emerging state of Kievan Rus' came increasingly under the cultural influence of the Byzantine Empire. The first recorded Rus' convert to Eastern Orthodoxy, the Princess Saint Olga, visited Constantinople in 945 or 957. In the 980s, according to tradition, Olga's grandson, Knyaz (Prince) Vladimir had his people baptised in the Dnieper River. This began a long history of the dominance of Eastern Orthodoxy in Ruthenia, a religious ascendancy that would later influence both Ukraine and Russia. Domination of \\"Little Russia\\" by Moscow (from the 17th century onwards) and by Saint Petersburg (from 1721) eventually led to the decline of Uniate Catholicism (officially founded in 1596) in the Ukrainian lands under Tsarist control.\\r\\nJudaism has existed in the Ukrainian lands for approximately 2000 years: Jewish traders appeared in Greek colonies. After the 7th century Judaism influenced the neighbouring Khazar Khaganate. From the 13th century Ashkenazi Jewish presence in Ukraine increased significantly. In the 18th century a new teaching of Judaism originated and became established in the Ukrainian lands - Hasidism.\\r\\nThe Golden Horde (which adopted Islam in 1313) and the Sunni Ottoman Empire (which conquered the Ukrainian littoral in the 1470s) brought Islam to their subject territories in present-day Ukraine. Crimean Tatars accepted Islam as the state religion (1313ÿ1502) of the Golden Horde, and later ruled as vassals of the Ottoman Empire (until the late 18th century).\\r\\nDuring the period of Soviet rule (c. 1917ÿ1991) the governing Soviet authorities officially promoted atheism and taught it in schools, while promoting various levels of persecution of religious believers and of their organizations. Only a small fraction of people remained official church-goers in that period, and the number of non-believers increased.\\r\\nThe 20th century saw schisms within Eastern Orthodoxy in Ukrainian territory.\\r\\nAs of 2016, according to a survey held by the Razumkov Center, 70% of the total respondents declared to be believers, while 10.1% were uncertain whether they believed or not, 7.2% were uninterested in beliefs, 6.3% were unbelievers, 2.7% were atheists, and a further 3.9% found it difficult to answer the question. Of the total respondents, about 65.4% of the population declared to be adherents of various types of Orthodoxy (25% Orthodoxy of the Kievan Patriarchate, 21.2% just Orthodox, 15% Orthodoxy of the Moscovian Patriarchate, 1.8% Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, and 2% other types of Orthodoxy), 7.1% just Christians, 6.5% Greek Rite Catholics, 1.9% Protestants, 1.1% Muslims and 1.0% Latin Rite Catholics. Judaism and Hinduism were the religions of 0.2% of the population each. A further 16.3% of the population were non-believers or believed in some other religion.[1]\\r\\nAmong those Ukrainians who declared to believe in Orthodoxy, 38.1% declared to be members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kievan Patriarchate, while 23.0% declared to be members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscovian Patriarchate. A further 2.7% were members of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. Among the remaining Orthodox Ukrainians, 32.3% declared to be \\"just Orthodox\\", without affiliation to any patriarchate, while a further 3.1% declared that they \\"did not know\\" which patriarchate or Orthodox church they belonged to.[1]\\r\\nIt is important to note that the Orthodox Church of the Kyevan Patriarchate is considered schismatic and doctrinally errant and ethnophyletic by the Orthodox Church of the Moscovian Patriarchate (officially called the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is the Ukrainian branch of the Russian Orthodox Church) and is not recognised as part of the broader Eastern Orthodox Church.[8]\\r\\n(including Greek)\\r\\n(other Christian)\\r\\nA February 2015 survey by Razumkov Centre, SOCIS, Rating and KIIS gave the following data at oblast level:[18]\\r\\n(unspecified)\\r\\n(incl. others)\\r\\nAs of 2016, 81.9% of the population of Ukraine declared to believe in Christianity.[1]\\r\\nAccording to the same survey, 65.4% of the total population adhered to Orthodoxy.[1]\\r\\nOrthodoxy is stronger in central (76.7%) and southern Ukraine (71.0%), while it comprises about two thirds of the total population in eastern Ukraine (63.2%), and a particularly low proportion of the population in western Ukraine (57.0%) and the Donbass (50.6%).[1]\\r\\nAs of 2016 the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscovian Patriarchate has 12,334 officially registered churches, by far more than any other religion in Ukraine.[19] The church is headed by the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine, Onuphrius (Berezovsky), and it uses presominantly the old Slavonic language for its services.\\r\\nThe Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kievan Patriarchate was formed after the declaration of independence of Ukraine in 1991, and has been headed since 1995 by Patriarch Filaret (Denysenko) with the title Patriarch of Kiev and all Rus-Ukraine, who was earlier the Russian Orthodox Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine. The church claims direct lineage to the Kievan Metropolia of Petro Mohyla. As of 2016, the church has 4,921 registered communities.[19] They use both Ukrainian and common Slavonic as liturgical languages.\\r\\nThe Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church was founded in 1919 in Kiev, banned during the Soviet era, and then legalized in 1989. As of 2016, it is constituted by 1,217 communities divided in two branches.[19]\\r\\nIn the interest of the possible future unification of the country's Orthodox churches, it did not name a patriarch to succeed the late Patriarch Dmitriy. The Autocephalous Church was formally headed in the country by Metropolitan Methodij of Ternopil and Podil; however, the large eparchies of Kharkiv-Poltava, Lviv, Rivne-Volyn, and Tavriya have officially broken relations with Methodij and have asked to be placed under the direct jurisdiction of the Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. The church uses Ukrainian as its liturgical language.\\r\\nThere are also communities belonging to the Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church and other Old Believers, to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, to the Ruthenian Orthodox Church, to various branches of the True Orthodox Church-Catacombism (including the Ruthenian True Orthodox Church, the Ukrainian True Orthodox Church and the Church of the Goths[20]), to the Romanian Orthodox Church (Metropolis of Bessarabia), to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church Canonical, to the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Church (Oriental Orthodox miaphysites), and to a variety of other minor Christian Orthodox churches.[19]\\r\\nByzantine Rite Catholicism is the religion of 6.5% of the population of Ukraine as of 2016. This church is almost utterly concentrated in western Ukraine, where it gathers a significant proportion of the population (29.9%). Latin Rite Catholicism, instead, is the religion of 1.0% of the population of Ukraine, mostly in western (1.4%) and central (1.9%) regions. Catholicism is nearly inexistent in eastern Ukraine and inexistent in Donbass.[1]\\r\\nAs of 2016, there are 4,733 registered Catholic churches, among which 3,799 belong to the two Byzantine Rite Churches and 933 belong to the Latin Church.[19]\\r\\nThe Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church traditionally constituted the second largest group of believers after the Christian Orthodox churches. The Union of Brest formed the Church in 1596 to unify Orthodox and Catholic believers. Outlawed by the Soviet Union in 1946 and legalized in 1987, the church was for forty-three years the single largest banned religious community in the world. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk is the present head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.[21] The church uses Ukrainian as its liturgical language.\\r\\nThe Church of the Latin Rite is traditionally associated with historical pockets of citizens of Polish ancestry who lived mainly in the central and western regions. It uses the Polish, Latin, Ukrainian and Russian as liturgical languages.\\r\\nMain concentrations of the Ruthenian Catholic Church are in Trans-Carpathia near the Hungarian border. This community has multiple ties in Hungary, Slovakia and the United States.\\r\\nThe Armenian Catholic Church has a very small presence. As of 2016 there is only one officially registered church belonging to Armenian Catholics.[19]\\r\\nAs of 2016, Protestants make up 1.9% of the population of Ukraine, with a strong concentration in western Ukraine (3.6%).[1] In the country there are communities of Evangelicalism, Baptists, Charismatic Christianity, as well as Methodists, Mennonites, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and others. There is also a Sub-Carpathian Reformed Church with about 140,000 members, which is one of the earliest Protestant communities in the country. The Embassy of God of Sunday Adelaja maintains a significant presence throughout the country, as do other neopentecostal groups.\\r\\nAs of 2016, there are 2,973 Evangelical churches, 2,853 churches of the Baptists, 1,082 Seventh-day Adventist churches, 128 Calvinist churches, 79 Lutheran churches, 1,337 churches of Charismatic Christianity, and 1,347 other organizations belonging to the Protestant spectrum (including 928 Jehovah's Witnesses' halls and 44 Mormon congregations).[19] In total, as of 2016 there are 9,799 registered Protestant groups in Ukraine.[19]\\r\\nAs of 2016, there are 29 registered communities belonging to the Church of the East.[19]\\r\\nJehovahs Witnesses claim to have 265,985 adherents, as reported in the movement's 2013 Yearbook. In 2010 the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) dedicated its Kyiv Ukraine Temple, and in 2012 claimed a membership more than 11,000 in 57 congregations in Ukraine.[22]\\r\\nAs of 2016, Islam is the religion of 1.1% of the population of Ukraine. Muslims are mostly concentrated in Donbass, where they make up 6.0% of the population.[1] In the same year, there are 229 registered Islamic organizations.[19] In Crimea, which in 2014 was incorporated by Russia, Crimean Tatar Muslims make up to 15% of the population. A major part of the south steppes of modern Ukraine at a certain period of time were inhabited by Turkic peoples, most of whom were Muslims since the fall of the Khazar Khanate.\\r\\nThe Crimean Tatars are the only indigenous Muslim ethnic group in the country. The Nogays, another Muslim group who lived in the steppes of southern Ukraine, emigrated to Turkey in the 18th-19th century. In addition, there are Muslim communities in all major Ukrainian cities representing Soviet-era migrants from Muslim backgrounds. There are approximately 150 mosques in Ukraine. Many Muslim mosques use the Crimean Tatar language, Arabic, Azeri, the Tatar language and Russian.\\r\\nThere are no single administrative centre, instead there are five of them: Spiritual Administration of Crimea Muslims (DUMK) - Crimean Tatars; Spiritual Administration of Ukraine Muslims (DUMU) - people of Caucasus, Crimean and Volga Tatars, Pakistani, Afghans, Arabs, Russians, Ukrainians; Spiritual Centre of Ukraine Muslims (DCUM) - Volga Tatars; Kiev muftiat - Kazan and Volga Tatars; UMMA - Arabs, Uzbeks, Russians, Ukrainians.[23]\\r\\nThe size of the Jewish population of Ukraine has varied over time. Jews are primarily an ethnicity, closely linked with the religion of Judaism. Jews in Ukraine are estimated to be between 100 and 300 thousands. However, ethnic Jews may be irreligious or practise other religions than Judaism. It is estimated than only 35-40% of the Jewish population of Ukraine is religious. Most observant Jews are believers of Orthodox Judaism, but there are as well communities of Chabad-Lubavitch and Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism.[24]\\r\\nJudaic congregations use Russian, Hebrew, Yiddish and Ukrainian languages. As of 2016, 0.2% of the population of Ukraine was found to be constituted by Jews believing in Judaism.[1] There are, in the same year, 271 officially registered Jewish religious communities.[1]\\r\\nHinduism is a minority faith in Ukraine. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness managed to propagate the Hindu faith through their missionary activities. As of 2016, Hindu believers constituted 0.2% of the population of Ukraine, with a slightly higher proportion in Donbass (0.6%).[1] In the same year, there were 85 Hindu, Hindu-inspired and other Eastern religions-inspired organizations in the country, among which 42 are Krishna Consciousness congregations.[19]\\r\\nThe Slavic native faith (Rodnovery, Ukrainian: ?־?Ѷ־ Ridnovirstvo, ?־?' Ridnovirya or i i Ridna Vira; otherwise called 楰־־' Pravoslavya\\"Orthodoxy\\") is represented in Ukraine by numerous organizations. As of 2016 there are 138 registered communities divided between the Church of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (?

There are many other unregistered groups and federations, for instance the Ancestral Fire of the Slavic Native Faith (˾־ ̷Ͷ Ѷ־'^? ?? ?), the Wrath of God Native Orthodox Faith, the North Caucasian Scythian Regional Fire, the Order of the Knights of the Solar God and the Rodoliubye Russian Rodnover Community.[25]\\r\\nLev Sylenko founded the Church of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (RUNVira) in 1966 in Chicago, United States, and only opened their first temple in the mother country of Ukraine after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The current headquarters of RUNVira is in Spring Glen, New York, United States. The doctrine of the Church of the Native Ukrainian National Faith, \\"Sylenkoism\\" or \\"Dazhbogism\\", is monist and centered around the god Dazhbog.\\r\\nSociologists estimated between 1,000 and 95,000 Rodnovers (0.2%) in Ukraine in the early 2000s.[26] Since 1999, the Book of Veles, which is a central philosophical text for many Rodnover churches, is taught in Ukrainian school curricula.[27][28]\\r\\nRodnovery has taken a significant role in the War in Donbass. The Azov Battalion, fighting for Kiev, is mainly composed of Ukrainian Rodnovers. It has been reported that it has been collaborating with the Kievan Patriarchate and taking over its churches.[29] On the other side of the spectrum, Russian Rodnovers who fight for Moscow have organized into battalions such as the Svarog Battalion (of the Vostok Brigade), the Svarozhich Battalion (Slavic Unification and Revival Battalion), and the Rusich Company.[30] Donbass has been documented as being a stronghold of Rodnovery; there are Russian Rodnover organizations which are reorganizing local villages and society according to traditional Indo-European trifunctionalism (according to which males are born to play one out of three roles in society, whether priests, warriors or farmers).[31]\\r\\nThe group of worshipers of gods according to the Roman way Sarmatia (Roman name for modern-day Ukraine) is building a Temple of Jupiter Perennus or Jupiter Perunnus (Perun) in the city of Poltava. The site was attacked and desecrated by Christians in 2011, but construction works continue to the present.[32]\\r\\nAs of 2016, there were 241 officially registered churches belonging to various new religious movements (including the aforementioned Hindu-inspired ones, 11 congregations of the Bah' Faith, six congregations of the Church of the Last TestamentVissarionism, and others), 58 registered Buddhist groups, and various registered churches for minority ethnicitiesincluding two Chinese Taoist churches, one Korean Methodist church, four Jewish Karaite churches, eight churches for Christian Jews and 35 churches of Messianic Judaism.[19]\\r\\nIn December 1996, the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations was formed with the objective of uniting around 90-95% of religious communities of Ukraine.[33][34] Since the end of 2003, the Council of Representatives of the Christian Churches of Ukraine exists in parallel to the council to promote the principles of Christianity in Ukraine and religious freedom.[35] Affiliation with either or both of the assemblies is voluntary.\\r\\nIn 2007, the council accounted for representatives of 19 organizations, while in 2013, only 18.

Some consider him the unifier of Egypt and founder of the First Dynasty, and in turn the first king of a unified Egypt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNarmer's identity is the subject of ongoing debates, although the dominant opinion among Egyptologists identifies Narmer with the pharaoh Menes, who is renowned in the ancient Egyptian written records as the first king, and the unifier of Ancient Egypt. Narmer's identification with Menes is based on the Narmer Palette (which shows Narmer as the unifier of Egypt) and the two necropolis seals from the Umm el-Qa'ab cemetery of Abydos that show him as the first king of the First Dynasty.\\r\\nThe date commonly given for the beginning of Narmers reign is ca. 3100 BC.[2][3] Other mainstream estimatings, using both the historical method and Radiocarbon dating, are in the range ca. 3273ÿ2987 BC.[a]\\r\\nThe complete spelling of Narmers name consists of the hieroglyphs for a catfish (n'r)[1] and a chisel (mr), hence the reading Narmer (using the rebus principle). This word is sometimes translated as raging catfish .[4] However, there is no consensus on this reading. Other translations include angry, fighting, fierceful, painful, furious, bad, evil, biting, menacing, or \\"stinging catfish\\".[5][6][7] Some scholars have taken entirely different approaches to reading the name that do not include catfish in the name at all, [8][9][10] but these approaches have not been generally accepted.\\r\\nRather than incorporating both hieroglyphs, Narmers name is often shown in an abbreviated form with just the catfish symbol, sometimes stylized, even, in some cases, represented by just a horizontal line.[11] This simplified spelling appears to be related to the formality of the context. In every case that a serekh is shown on a work of stone, or an official seal impression, it has both symbols. But, in most cases, where the name is shown on a piece of pottery or a rock inscription, just the catfish, or a simplified version of it appears.\\r\\nTwo alternative spellings of Narmers name have also been found. On a mud sealing from Tarkhan, the symbol for the Tjay-bird (Gardiner sign G47, a flapping fledgling) has been added to the two symbols for Narmer within the serekh. This has been interpreted as meaning Narmer the masculine,[12] however, according to Ilona Regulski,[13] The third sign (the Tjay-bird) is not an integral part of the royal name since it occurs so infrequently. Godron[14] suggested that the extra sign is not part of the name, but was put inside the serekh for compositional convenience.\\r\\nIn addition, two necropolis seals from Abydos show the name in a unique way: While the chisel is shown conventionally where the catfish would be expected, there is a symbol that has been interpreted by several scholars as an animal skin.[15] According to Dreyer, it is probably a catfish with a bulls tail, similar to the image of Narmer on the Narmer Palette in which he is shown wearing a bulls tail as a symbol of power.[16]\\r\\nAlthough highly inter-related, the questions of who was Menes? and who unified Egypt? are actually two separate issues. Narmer is often credited with the unification of Egypt by means of the conquest of Lower Egypt by Upper Egypt. While Menes is traditionally considered the first king of Ancient Egypt, Narmer has been identified by the majority of Egyptologists as the same person as Menes. Although vigorously debated (Hor-Aha, Narmers successor, is the primary alternative identified as Menes by many authorities), the predominant opinion is that Narmer was Menes. [b]\\r\\nThe issue is confusing because Narmer is a Horus Name, while Menes is a personal name (birth name or nisut-bitj name). All of the King Lists which began to appear in the New Kingdom era list the personal names of the kings, and almost all begin with Menes, or begin with divine and/or semi-divine rulers, with Menes as the first human king. The difficulty is aligning the contemporary archaeological evidence which lists Horus Names with the King Lists that list personal names.\\r\\nTwo documents have been put forward as proof either that Narmer was Menes or alternatively Hor-Aha was Menes. The first is the Naqada Label which shows a serekh of Hor-Aha next to an enclosure inside of which are symbols that have been interpreted by some scholars as the name Menes. The second is the seal impression from Abydos that alternates between a serekh of Narmer and the chessboard symbol, mn, which is interpreted as an abbreviation of Menes. Arguments have been made with regard to each of these documents in favour of Narmer or Hor-Aha being Menes, but in neither case, are the arguments conclusive.[c]\\r\\nTwo necropolis sealings, found in 1985 and 1991 in Abydos, in or near the tombs of Den[24]and Qaa,[25]show Narmer as the first king on each list, followed by Hor-Aha. The Qaa sealing lists all eight of the kings of what scholars now call the First Dynasty in the correct order, starting with Narmer. These necropolis sealings are strong evidence that Narmer was the first king of the First Dynasty ÿ hence is the same person as Menes.[26]\\r\\nThe famous Narmer Palette, discovered by James E. Quibell in the 1897-1898 season at Hierakonpolis,[27] shows Narmer wearing the crown of Upper Egypt on one side of the palette, and the crown of Lower Egypt on the other side, giving rise to the theory that Narmer unified the two lands.[28] Since its discovery, however, it has been debated whether the Narmer Palette represents an actual historic event or is purely symbolic.[d] Of course, the Narmer Palette could represent an actual historical event while at the same time having a symbolic significance.\\r\\nIn 1993, Gnter Dreyer discovered a year label of Narmer at Abydos, depicting the same event that is depicted on the Narmer Palette. In the First Dynasty, years were identified by the name of the king and an important event that occurred in that year. A year label was typically attached to a container of goods and included the name of the king, a description or representation of the event that identified the year, and a description of the attached goods. This year label shows that the Narmer Palette depicts an actual historical event .[29] Support for this conclusion (in addition to Dreyer) includes Wilkinson [30] and Davies & Friedman .[31] Although this interpretation of the year label is the dominant opinion among Egyptologists, there are exceptions including Baines [32] and Wengrow .[33]\\r\\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Egypt was at least partially unified during the reigns of Ka and Iry-Hor (Narmers immediate predecessors), and perhaps as early as Scorpion I (several generations before Iry-Hor).Tax collection is probably documented for Ka [34] and Iry-Hor.[35] The evidence for a role for Scorpion I in Lower Egypt comes from his tomb Uj in Abydos (Upper Egypt), where labels were found identifying goods from Lower Egypt.[36] These are not tax documents, however, so they are probably indications of trade rather than subjugation. There is a substantial difference in the quantity and distribution of inscriptions with the names of those earlier kings in Lower Egypt and Canaan (which was reached through Lower Egypt), compared to the inscriptions of Narmer. Kas inscriptions have been found in three sites in Lower Egypt and one in Canaan.[37] Iry-Hor inscriptions have also been found in two sites in Lower Egypt and one in Canaan.[37][38] This must be compared to Narmer, whose serekhs have been found in ten sites in Lower Egypt and nine sites in Canaan (see discussion in Tomb and Artifacts section). This demonstrates a qualitative difference between Narmers role in Lower Egypt compared to his two immediate predecessors. There is no evidence in Lower Egypt of any Upper Egyptian kings presence before Iry-Hor. The archaeological evidence suggest that the unification began before Narmer, but was completed by him through the conquest of a polity in the North-West Delta as depicted on the Narmer Palette.[39]\\r\\nThe importance that Narmer attached to his unification of Egypt is shown by the fact that it is commemorated not only on the Narmer Palette, but on a cylinder seal,[40] the Narmer Year Label,[29] and the Narmer Boxes;[41]and the consequences of the event are commemorated on the Narmer Macehead.[42] The importance of the unification to ancient Egyptians is shown by the fact that Narmer is shown as the first king on the two necropolis seals, and under the name Menes, the first king in the later King Lists. Although there is archaeological evidence of a few kings before Narmer, none of them are mentioned in any of those sources. It can be accurately said that from the point of view of Ancient Egyptians, history began with Narmer and the unification of Egypt, and that everything before him was relegated to the realm of myth.\\r\\nAccording to Manetho (quoted in Eusebius (Fr. 7(a)), Menes made a foreign expedition and won renown. If this is correct (and assuming it refers to Narmer), it was undoubtedly to the land of Canaan where Narmers serekh has been identified at nine different sites. An Egyptian presence in Canaan predates Narmer, but after about 200 years of active presence in Canaan, [43] Egyptian presence peaked during Narmer's reign and quickly declined afterwards. The relationship between Egypt and Canaan began around the end of the fifth millennium and apparently came to an end sometime during the Second Dynasty when it ceased altogether.[44] It peaked during the Dynasty 0 through the reign of Narmer.[45] Dating to this period are 33 Egyptian serekhs found in Canaan,[46] among which 20 have been attributed to Narmer. Prior to Narmer, only one serekh of Ka and one inscription with Iry-Hors name have been found in Canaan.[47] The serekhs earlier than Iry-Hor are either generic serekhs that do not refer to a specific king, or are for kings not attested in Abydos.[45] Indicative of the decline of Egyptian presence in the region after Narmer, only one serekh attributed to his successor, Hor-Aha, has been found in Canaan.[45] It should be noted that even this one example is questionable, Wilkinson does not believe there are any serekhs of Hor-Aha outside Egypt[48] and very few serekhs of kings for the rest of the first two dynasties have been found in Canaan.[49]\\r\\nThe Egyptian presence in Canaan is best demonstrated by the presence of pottery made from Egyptian Nile clay and found in Canaan.[e] as well as pottery made from local clay, but in the Egyptian style. The latter suggests the existence of Egyptian colonies rather than just trade.[51]\\r\\nThe nature of Egypts role in Canaan has been vigorously debated, between scholars who suggest a military invasion[52] and others proposing that only trade and colonization were involved. Although latter has gained predominance,[51] [53] the presence of fortifications at Tell es-Sakan dating to the Dynasty 0 through early Dynasty 1 period, and built almost entirely using an Egyptian style of construction, demonstrate that there must have also been some kind of Egyptian military presence.[54]\\r\\nRegardless of the nature of Egypts presence in Canaan, control of trade to (and through) Canaan was important to Ancient Egypt. Narmer probably did not establish Egypts initial influence in Canaan by a military invasion, but a military campaign by Narmer to re-assert Egyptian authority, or to increase its sphere of influence in the region, is certainly plausible. In addition to the quote by Manetho, and the large number of Narmer serekhs found in Canaan, a recent reconstruction of a box of Narmers by Dreyer may have commemorated a military campaign in Canaan.[55] It may also represent just the presentation of tribute to Narmer by Canaanites.[55]\\r\\nNarmer and Hor-Ahas names were both found in what is believed to be Neithhoteps tomb, which led Egyptologists to conclude that she was Narmers queen and mother of Hor-Aha.[56] Neithhoteps name means \\"Neith is satisfied\\". This suggests that she was a princess of Lower Egypt (based on the fact that Neith is the patron goddess of Sais in the Western Delta, exactly the area Narmer conquered to complete the unification of Egypt), and that this was a marriage to consolidate the two regions of Egypt.[56] The fact that her tomb is in Naqada, in Upper Egypt, has led some to the conclusion that she was a descendent of the predynastic rulers of Naqada who ruled prior to its incorporation into a united Upper Egypt.[57] It has also been suggested that the Narmer Macehead commemorates this wedding.[58] However, the discovery in 2012 of rock inscriptions in Sinai by Pierre Tallet[59] raise questions about whether she was really Narmers wife.[f]\\r\\nNarmer's tomb in Umm el-Qa'ab near Abydos in Upper Egypt consists of two joined chambers (B17 and B18), lined in mud brick. Although both Amlineau and Petrie excavated tombs B17 and B18, it is only in 1964 that Kaiser identified them as being Narmers .[61][g] Narmer's tomb is located next to the tombs of Ka, who likely ruled Upper Egypt just before Narmer, and Hor-Aha, who was his immediate successor.[h]\\r\\nAs the tomb dates back more than 5000 years, and has been pillaged, repeatedly, from antiquity to modern times, it is amazing that anything useful could be discovered in it. Because of the repeated disturbances in Umm el-Qaab, many articles of Narmers were found in other graves, and objects of other kings, were recovered in Narmers grave. However, Flinders Petrie during the period 1899-1903, [64] [65] and, starting in the 1970s, the German Archaeological Institute (DAI)[i] have made discoveries of the greatest importance to the history of Early Egypt by their re-excavation of the tombs of Umm el-Qaab.\\r\\nDespite the chaotic condition of the cemetery, inscriptions on both wood and bone, seal impressions, as well as dozens of flint arrowheads (Petrie says with dismay that hundreds of arrowheads were discovered by \\"the French\\", presumably mile Amlineau. What happened to them is not clear, but none ended up in the Cairo Museum.[66]) Flint knives and a fragment of an ebony chair leg were also discovered in Narmers tomb, all of which might be part of the original funerary assemblage. The flint knives and fragment of a chair leg were not included in any of Petries publications, but are now at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology (University College London), registration numbers UC35679, UC52786, and UC35682. According to Dreyer,[16] these arrowheads are probably from the tomb of Djer, where similar arrowheads were found.[67]\\r\\nIt is likely that all of the kings of Ancient Egypt buried in Umm el-Qaab had funerary enclosures in Abydos northern cemetery, near the cultivation line. These were characterized by large mud brick walls that enclosed space in which funerary ceremonies are believed to have taken place. Eight enclosures have been excavated, two of which have not been definitely identified. [68][69] While it has yet to be confirmed, one of these unidentified funerary enclosures may have belonged to Narmer[j]\\r\\nNarmer is well attested throughout Egypt, southern Canaan and Sinai: altogether 98 inscriptions at 26 sites.[k] At Abydos and Hierakonpolis Narmer's name appears both within a serekh and without reference to a serekh. At every other site except Coptos, Narmer's name appears in a serekh.In Egypt, his name has been found at 17 sites: 4 in Upper Egypt (Hierakonpolis,[75] Naqada,[76] [77] Abydos, [64][65] and Coptos[78][79]); ten in Lower Egypt (Tarkhan,[80][81] Helwan,[82][83] Zawyet el'Aryan,[84] Tell Ibrahim Awad,[85] Ezbet el-Tell,[86] Minshat Abu Omar,[87] [88] Saqqara,[89][90] Buto,[91] Tell el-Farkha,[92][93] and Kafr Hassan Dawood[94]); one in the Eastern Desert (Wadi el-Qaash[95]); and two in the Western Desert (Kharga Oasis[96] [97] and Gebel Tjauti.[98][99]).\\r\\nDuring Narmer's reign, Egypt had an active economic presence in southern Canaan. Pottery sherds have been discovered at several sites, both from pots made in Egypt and imported to Canaan and others made in the Egyptian style out of local materials.\\r\\nTwenty serekhs have been found in Canaan that may belong to Narmer, but seven of those are uncertain or controversial. These serekhs came from eight different sites: Tel Arad,[100][101] En Besor (Ein HaBesor),[102][103] Tel es-Sakan,[104][105] Nahal Tillah (Halif Terrace),[106] Tel Erani (Tel Gat),[107][108] Small Tel Malhata,[109][110] Tel Ma'ahaz,[111] and Tel Lod,[112]\\r\\nNarmer's serekh, along with those of other Predynastic and Early Dynastic kings, has been found at the Wadi 'Ameyra in the southern Sinai, where inscriptions commemorate Egyptian mining expeditions to the area.[113][114]\\r\\nThe Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London, exhibits a limestone head of an early Egyptian king which the Museum identifies as being a depiction of Narmer on the basis of the similarity (according to Petrie[115]) to the head of Narmer on the Narmer Palette. This has not been generally accepted. According to Trope, Quirke & Lacovara,[116] the suggestion that it is Narmer is unlikely. Alternatively, they suggest the Fourth Dynasty king Khufu. Stevenson[117] also identifies it as Khufu. Charron[118] identifies it as a king of the Thinite Period (the first two dynasties), but does not believe it can be assigned to any particular king. Wilkinson[119] describes it as probably Second Dynasty.\\r\\nFirst recorded at the end of the 19th century, an important series of rock carving at Nag el-Hamdulab near Aswan was rediscovered in 2009, and its importance only realized then.[120] [121][122] Among the many inscriptions, tableau 7a shows a man wearing a headdress similar to the white crown of Upper Egypt and carrying a scepter. He is followed by a man with a fan. He is then preceded by two men with standards, and accompanied by a dog. Apart from the dog motif, this scene is similar to scenes on the Scorpion Macehead and the recto of the Narmer Palette. The man ÿ armed with pharaonic regalia (the crown and scepter) can clearly be identified as a king. Although no name appears in the tableau, Darnell [121] attributes it to Narmer, based on the iconography, and suggests that it might represent an actual visit to the region by Narmer for a Following of Horus ritual. In an interview in 2012, Gatto[123] also describes the king in the inscription as Narmer. However, Hendrickx places the scene slightly before Narmer, based, in part on the uncharacteristic absence of Narmers royal name in the inscription.\\r\\nAlabaster statue of a baboon divinity with the name of the pharaoh Narmer inscribed on its base, on display at the ?gyptisches Museum Berlin.\\r\\nA mud jar sealing indicating that the contents came from the estate of the pharaoh Narmer.

It is the primary defensive and offensive piece of equipment used by the Marvel Comics superhero Captain America; he is seldom seen without it. Over the years, Captain America has had the use of several different shields of varying composition and design. His original heater shield first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941), published by Marvel's 1940s predecessor, Timely Comics. The circular shield best associated with the character debuted in the next issue, Captain America Comics #2. Captain America was created by the team of writer-artist Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain America's shield is virtually indestructible under normal conditions;[1] while cosmic and magical or godly opponents have broken the shield, the shield proves strong enough to absorb Hulk's strength, and repel an attack from Thor's mystical hammer Mj?lnir without any visible damage. As it is made of vibranium, it is able to absorb all kinetic energy and transfers very little energy from each impact, meaning Captain America does not feel recoil or transferred impact forces from blocking attacks. These physical properties also means the shield can bounce off of most smooth surfaces, ricocheting multiple times with minimal loss in aerodynamic stability or velocity. The shield can also absorb the kinetic impact of a fall, allowing Captain America to land safely even when jumping off of several stories, as can be seen in Captain America: Winter Soldier movie when he escaped from the S.H.I.E.L.D.'s STRIKE squad by jumping off an elevator.[volume?&?issue?needed]\\r\\nA common misconception is that the shield can \\"magically\\" return to Captain America[citation needed]. The \\"superhuman serum\\" that enhanced Captain America's physical attributes also improved his mental facultiessuch as cognition, perception, balance, aim, and reflexesto near genius-level. This allows him to instantly calculate ballistic-physics and predict the probable trajectory of objects in motion. This makes him a perfect shot. He can dodge or deflect bullets with his shield without collateral ricochet to civilians, to calculate where or how the shield will bounce and when it will return to his location, or trip a running person to cause them to fall into a specific position.[citation needed] In Avengers: Age of Ultron, he pulls the shield back to him after it is stuck, but this is through an electromagnet fastened on his arm. After his memories are altered to make him believe that he is a Hydra sleeper agent, Rogers uses his precise knowledge of the shield to put Sam Wilson, its current wielder, in a position where he will fail to save a senator from Flag-Smasher by arranging for Wilson to be forced to throw the shield in a manner that Rogers knows from his own experience will miss its target by mere millimetres, as part of his agenda to undermine Sam's status as Captain America.[2]\\r\\nIn his debut, Captain America (secretly U.S. Army Private Steve Rogers) is equipped with a triangular, badge-shaped shield made from vibranium. After complaints by rival comic-book publisher MLJ that the design was too similar to that of its own patriotic hero the Shield,[3] Timely Comics replaced the triangular shield with a disc-shaped one.\\r\\nWhile the origin and fate of the original shield were not described in the original comics from the 1940s, the shield's fate was revealed decades later in 2001 through a retconned story. According to the tale, King T'Chaka of the African nation Wakanda met Captain America in early 1941 and gave him a second sample of vibranium, an alien metal with unique vibration absorption properties and found only in Wakanda and the Savage Land.[4] The new Vibranium sample was used to make Captain America's circular shield and his triangular one was retired.\\r\\nCaptain America received a second triangular shield that he used until given his disc-shaped shield, which was personally presented to him by President Franklin Roosevelt.[5] This second triangular shield would be kept in storage with Rogers' other personal effects after the war. It was recovered at some point after Rogers joined the superhero team the Avengers in The Avengers #4, and was kept at Avengers Mansion. It was destroyed by the supervillain Mr. Hyde during a raid on the mansion by Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil, and later \\"plucked from time\\" and restored by Zemo in Thunderbolts #105 (Oct. 2006). The shield (along with other sentimental items thought destroyed) was returned to Captain America. A third triangular shield is kept in the Smithsonian Institution. It was used by Captain America when he foiled a terrorist attack on the museum itself after the loss of his usual shield; it was then given to him in gratitude. This shield is destroyed several issues later by a Kree alien warrior.\\r\\nThe shield destroyed by Hydra and restored by Zemo was eventually passed on to Elijah Bradley, the teenage hero known as the Patriot and leader of the Young Avengers.\\r\\nIn 2010, the history of the original shield was revised. In the limited series Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers, Captain America, Sergeant Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos meet Azzari (grandfather of T'Challa) -- the Black Panther and king of Wakanda during World War II. Aided by Wakandan military forces, they successfully repel a series of Nazi assaults led by the Red Skull and Baron Strucker. During the battle, the Red Skull (wearing a battle-suit) crushes the triangular shield, and Captain America uses a circular vibranium shield provided by T'Chaka to incapacitate the Skull. The weapon serves as the inspiration for the circular shield that the super-soldier begins using upon his return to America, and the encounter marks the beginning of friendly relations between the United States and Wakanda.[6]\\r\\nThe circular shield most associated with Captain America made its debut in Captain America Comics #2 (April 1941). A concavo-convex metal disc approximately 2.5 feet (0.76?m) in diameter, is indestructible and has remained his most constant shield over the decades.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Captain America #255 (March 1981), it is established that the shield was presented to Rogers by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[7] The shield is created by a fictional American metallurgist named Myron MacLain, who had been commissioned by the US government to create an indestructible armor material to aid the war effort. MacLain experiments with the indestructible vibration-absorbing metal vibranium.[4]\\r\\nDuring one of his experiments to fuse vibranium with an experimental iron alloy [8] MacLain falls asleep and awakens to find that the resulting alloy had set in a tank hatch mold. It was then painted to become Captain America's symbol. MacLain would later attempt to recreate the shield's metal to no avail, his experiments instead eventually yielding the super-metal adamantium.[citation needed]\\r\\nRogers' indestructible shield is more durable than regular adamantium and one of the most indestructible objects in The Marvel Universe. Carl \\"Crusher\\" Creel, The Absorbing Man, once absorbed the properties the shield while battling The Avengers. The vibranium grants the shield unusual properties, allowing it to absorb all of the kinetic impact and vibrations from any blows that the shield receives without injuring Rogers in the process.The proto-adamantium allows the shield to be stronger than the strongest Adamantium.The vibranium is also a factor in the way Rogers throws his shield: he often uses it to ricochet and strike multiple opponents or stationary objects with little loss of velocity in its forward movement after each impact.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen Rogers returns from suspended animation, Tony Stark \\"improves\\" the shield by incorporating electronic and magnetic components in it so that Rogers can even control it in flight. Rogers soon discards the additional components because he finds that it upsets the balance of the shield when thrown.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter Rogers' death, Stark takes over custody of the shield, with one replica on display in a museum, and another replica buried with Rogers. The real one is kept by Stark to be used by the new Captain America, whenever they deem it appropriate to train a new one. After failing to find a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent capable of throwing it properly, Stark offers the shield to Clint Barton (known at that time as Ronin), who does manage to throw it. During a confrontation involving the Young Avengers, he scolds Kate Bishop for using the Hawkeye name. She tells him that the \\"Real Cap\\" gave her that name in honor of his at the time dead friend, so this leads Barton to refuse to be Captain America.[9] The shield is subsequently stolen by the Winter Soldier, who did not want anyone else to carry the shield. Inevitably, in an effort to honor Rogers' last wishes, Stark offers to let the Winter Soldier (Bucky Barnes) keep the shield, and to serve as the new Captain America. Bucky accepts. This offer is made \\"off the books\\", and only the two of them, the Black Widow, and the Falcon, are aware of the situation.[10]\\r\\nAlthough Bucky attempted to return the shield to Rogers after his resurrection, Rogers let Bucky keep it as he felt that he could do more good in his new role as Commander Steve Rogers rather than Captain America, using a photonic shield in its place when circumstances called for him to go into combat. He reclaimed the shield for good after Bucky was apparently killed during the Fear Itself event- Bucky really going underground after his past as the Winter Soldier was exposed-, which also resulted in the shield being broken and reassembled by Asgardian blacksmiths, who add some of the mystical metal Uru to the reconstructed shield, making it even stronger than before, although it is left with a noticeable scar that Rogers decided to keep to give the shield character.[11] This premise was not observed in subsequent storylines, or considered canon, as artists have not continued depicting the shield with the scar.[12]\\r\\nIn the 2003-2004 Marvel Comics/DC Comics inter-company crossover limited series JLA/Avengers, Superman is given the shield by Captain America to wield in battle in the final confrontation with Krona, and is impressed with its might. When he asks where he could get one just like it while battling foes, Thor replies, \\"Enjoy it while thou canst, Superman. There is none other like it in all the worlds\\". Throughout the final battle, the shield changes forms between the pointed shield and the circular shield due to various temporal ripples caused by Krona's equipment, and Superman even loses the shield altogether at one point when he morphs into his energy form while Cap reacquires the photonic shield, although the metal shield reappears on Superman's arm after he morphs back into his regular form.\\r\\nOver time the shield has been damaged or destroyed several times within the confines of the Earth-616 continuity, though they are not considered canon:\\r\\nIn The Avengers #215ÿ216, the Molecule Man used his total control over matter to disintegrate the shield, along with Thor's hammer, Iron Man's armor, and the Silver Surfer's board. After he does so, he comments that the board's molecules are \\"weird\\", and while there are \\"odd forces interweaving\\" among the hammer's molecules, the shield is \\"weirdest of all\\". He later reassembles these items, with the exception of the armor, as the electronic circuits are too complicated for him to understand at that time.[13]\\r\\nDuring the 1984-1985 Secret Wars limited series, the shield is partially destroyed by Doctor Doom, who has stolen the power of the godlike being known as the Beyonder. Even broken, Rogers is able to wield what is left as an effective weapon, with the shield largely retaining its balance when thrown. When the Beyonder reclaims its power, the heroes are temporarily granted the ability to realize their wishes. Rogers uses this to reconstruct the shield.[14]\\r\\nDuring the 1991 miniseries The Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos, who possesses near-omnipotence via the Infinity Gauntlet, shatters the shield with a blow of his fist while in combat with Captain America. The shield is soon restored by Thanos' alleged granddaughter, Nebula, when she obtains the Gauntlet and uses it to undo the events of Thanos's temporary godhood, resulting in her erasing the death and destruction that Thanos had caused over the previous 24 hours.[15]\\r\\nDue to a stray molecule being out of place when Rogers reconstructed the shield using the Beyonder's residual power, a vibranium 'cancer' was introduced to the shield, spreading with each subsequent impact until it finally shattered after it was retrieved from the bottom of the ocean. Learning that the vibranium cancer would require the destruction of the shield in order to cure it, Rogers took the shield to the main vibranium deposit in Wakanda so that he could use a device created by Tony Stark to halt the 'cancer' before it could contaminate the Wakandan vibranium and destroy the world, only to be intercepted by the villain Klaw, who sought to absorb the power and become stronger. Fortunately, the amount of energy Klaw had absorbed was released when he struck the shattered shield with full force after Rogers picked it up on reflex, resulting in Klaw unintentionally restoring the shield to its original state, realigning its molecules and destroying the cancer.[16]\\r\\nIn Avengers Vol. 3 #63 (March 2003), an enraged Thor, wielding the Odinforce, scrapes the shield. Thor later repairs it.[17]\\r\\nIn Thor Vol. 2 #73 (January 2004) an enraged King Thor with Rune Magic, destroyed the shield, killing Steve Rogers with it.[18] This timeline was later erased in Thor Vol. 2 #79.[19]\\r\\nDuring the 2011 miniseries Fear Itself, the Serpent, the Asgardian god of fear and brother to Odin, breaks it in half with his bare hands.[20] After the battle, the shield is repaired by Asgardian dwarves and Tony Stark with added Asgardian uru-infused enhancements and Stark's own technology to make it stronger, though a scar is left, and the dwarves are unable to repair it. Stark offers a solution to the scar, but Rogers declines, saying that it \\"gave the old girl a little bit of character\\". This premise was not observed in subsequent storylines, or considered canon, as artists have not continued depicting the shield with the scar.\\r\\nIn issue #7 of the Marvel series Strikeforce: Morituri the shield is stored in a trophy room belonging to the alien \\"Horde\\" invaders.[35]\\r\\nCaptain America's shield is a recurring image throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise:","input":"What material is captain america's shield made out of?"},{"output":"Kuomintang","context":"Chinese Communist victory\\r\\n Harry S. Truman (1950ÿ53)\\r\\nThe Chinese Civil War was a war fought between the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government of the Republic of China and the Communist Party of China (CPC). Although many authorities pay particular attention to the four years from 1945 to 1949, the war started from conflicts that began in August 1927, with the White Terror at the end of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition of 1926ÿ1928, and essentially ended when major hostilities ceased in 1950.[9] The conflict took place in two stages: the first between 1927 and 1937, and the second from 1946 to 1950, with the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937ÿ1945 separating them. The war marked a major turning point in modern Chinese history, with the CPC gaining control of almost the entire Mainland China and establishing the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 to replace the KMT's Republic of China (ROC). It resulted in a lasting political and military standoff between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, with the ROC in Taiwan and the PRC in mainland China both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of all China.\\r\\nThe war represented an ideological split between the communist CPC and the nationalist KMT. Conflict continued intermittently until late 1937, when the two parties came together to form the Second United Front to counter the Imperial Japanese Army threat and to prevent the country from crumbling. Full-scale civil war in China resumed in 1946, a year after the end of hostilities with Japan. Four years later came the cessation of major military activity, with the newly founded People's Republic of China controlling mainland China (including Hainan), and the Republic of China's jurisdiction restricted to Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, Matsu and several outlying islands.\\r\\nAs of 2017[update] no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed, and the debate continues as to whether the civil war has legally ended.[10] Relations between both sides, officially called the Cross-Strait relations, have been hindered by military threats and political and economic pressure, particularly over Taiwan's political status, with both governments officially adhering to the One-China policy. The PRC still actively claims Taiwan as part of its territory and continues to threaten the ROC with a military invasion if the ROC officially declares independence by changing its name to and gaining international recognition as the \\"Republic of Taiwan\\". The ROC, for its part, claims mainland China, and both parties continue the fight over diplomatic recognition. As of 2017[update] the war as such occurs on the political and economic fronts in the relations without actual military action. However, the two separate governments in China have close economic ties.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in the aftermath of the Xinhai Revolution, China fell into a brief period of civil war before Yuan Shikai assumed the presidency of the newly formed Republic of China.[11] The administration became known as the Beiyang Government, with its capital in Peking. After the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, the following years were characterized by the power struggle between different cliques in the former Beiyang Army. In the meantime, the Kuomintang, led by Sun Yat-sen, created a new government in Guangzhou to resist the rule of Beiyang Government through a series of movements.\\r\\nSun's efforts to obtain aid from the Western countries were ignored, thus he turned to the Soviet Union in 1921. For political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Communist Party of China, which would eventually found the People's Republic of China. Thus the struggle for power in China began between the KMT and the CPC.\\r\\nIn 1923, a joint statement by Sun and Soviet representative Adolph Joffe in Shanghai pledged Soviet assistance to China's unification.[12] The Sun-Joffe Manifesto was a declaration of cooperation among the Comintern, KMT and CPC.[12] Comintern agent Mikhail Borodin arrived in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CPC joined the KMT to form the First United Front.[5]\\r\\nIn 1923, Sun sent Chiang Kai-shek, one of his lieutenants from his Tongmenghui days, for several months of military and political study in the Soviet capital Moscow.[13] By 1924, Chiang became the head of the Whampoa Military Academy, and rose to prominence as Sun's successor as head of the KMT.[13]\\r\\nThe Soviets provided the academy with much educational material, organization and equipment, including munitions.[13] They also provided education in many of the techniques for mass mobilization. With this aid, Sun was able to raise a dedicated \\"army of the party,\\" with which he hoped to defeat the warlords militarily. CPC members were also present in the academy, and many of them became instructors, including Zhou Enlai, who was made a political instructor.[14]\\r\\nCommunist members were allowed to join the KMT on an individual basis.[12] The CPC itself was still small at the time, having a membership of 300 in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925.[15] As of 1923, the KMT had 50,000 members.[15]\\r\\nHowever, after Sun died in 1925, the KMT split into left- and right-wing movements. KMT members worried that the Soviets were trying to destroy the KMT from inside using the CPC. The CPC then began movements in opposition of the Northern Expedition, passing a resolution against it at a party meeting.\\r\\nThen, in March 1927, the KMT held its second party meeting where the Soviets helped pass resolutions against the Expedition and curbing Chiang's power. Soon, the KMT would be clearly divided.\\r\\nIn early 1927, the KMT-CPC rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CPC and the left wing of the KMT had decided to move the seat of the KMT government from Guangzhou to Wuhan, where communist influence was strong.[15] However, Chiang and Li Zongren, whose armies defeated warlord Sun Chuanfang, moved eastward toward Jiangxi. The leftists rejected Chiang's demand to eliminate Communist influence within KMT and Chiang denounced them for betraying Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People by taking orders from the Soviet Union. According to Mao Zedong, Chiang's tolerance of the CPC in the KMT camp decreased as his power increased.[16]\\r\\nOn April 7, Chiang and several other KMT leaders held a meeting, during which they proposed that Communist activities were socially and economically disruptive and had to be undone for the national revolution to proceed. On April 12, in Shanghai, the KMT was purged of leftists with the arrest and execution of hundreds of CPC members[17] on the orders of General Bai Chongxi. The CPC referred to this as the April 12 Incident or Shanghai Massacre.[18] This incident widened the rift between Chiang and Wang Jingwei, another warlord who controlled the city of Wuhan.\\r\\nEventually, the left wing of the KMT also expelled CPC members from the Wuhan government, which in turn was toppled by Chiang Kai-shek. The KMT resumed its campaign against warlords and captured Beijing in June 1928.[19] Soon, most of eastern China was under the control of the Nanjing central government, which received prompt international recognition as the sole legitimate government of China. The KMT government announced, in conformity with Sun Yat-sen, the formula for the three stages of revolution: military unification, political tutelage, and constitutional democracy.[20]\\r\\nOn 1 August 1927, CPC took arms and clashed with the KMT government. This conflict led to the creation of the Red Army.[1][21] On August 4, Red Army forces gave up Nanchang and went southwards in an attack on Guangdong. Government forces quickly reoccupied Nanchang while other rebels escaped into the countryside.[1] A CPC meeting on August 7 confirmed the party's intention to take power by force, followed by a violent anti-Communist campaign by Wang Jingwei's government in Wuhan starting on August 8. On August 14, Chiang Kai-shek fled Nanjing. Attempts were later made by the CPC to take the cities of Changsha, Shantou and Guangzhou. The Red Army consisting of mutinous former National Revolutionary Army (NRA) soldiers as well as armed peasants established control over several areas in southern China.[21] KMT forces continued to attempt to suppress the rebellions.[21] Then, in September, Wang Jingwei was forced out of Wuhan. September also saw an unsuccessful armed rural insurrection, known as the Autumn Harvest Uprising, led by Mao Zedong.[22] Borodin then returned to the USSR in October via Mongolia. In November, Chiang Kai-shek went to Shanghai and invited Wang to join him. On December 11, the CPC started the Guangzhou Uprising, establishing a soviet there the next day, but lost the city by December 13 to a counter-attack under the orders of General Zhang Fakui. On December 16, Wang Jingwei fled to France. There were now three capitals in China: the internationally recognized republic capital in Beijing, the CPC and left-wing KMT at Wuhan and the right-wing KMT regime at Nanjing, which would remain the KMT capital for the next decade.[23][24]\\r\\nThis marked the beginning of a ten-year armed struggle, known in mainland China as the \\"Ten-Year Civil War\\" (eʗM) which ended with the Xi'an Incident when Chiang Kai-shek was forced to form the Second United Front against invading forces from Japan. In 1930 the Central Plains War broke out as an internal conflict of the KMT. It was launched by Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan and Wang Jingwei. The attention was turned to root out remaining pockets of Communist activity in a series of five encirclement campaigns.[25] The first and second campaigns failed and the third was aborted due to the Mukden Incident. The fourth campaign (1932ÿ1933) achieved some early successes, but Chiang's armies were badly mauled when they tried to penetrate into the heart of Mao's Soviet Chinese Republic. During these campaigns, KMT columns struck swiftly into Communist areas, but were easily engulfed by the vast countryside and were not able to consolidate their foothold.\\r\\nFinally, in late 1934, Chiang launched a fifth campaign that involved the systematic encirclement of the Jiangxi Soviet region with fortified blockhouses.[26] Unlike previous campaigns in which they penetrated deeply in a single strike, this time the KMT troops patiently built blockhouses, each separated by about five miles, to surround the Communist areas and cut off their supplies and food sources.[26]\\r\\nIn October 1934 the CPC took advantage of gaps in the ring of blockhouses (manned by the forces of a warlord ally of Chiang Kai-shek's, rather than regular KMT troops) and broke out of the encirclement. The warlord armies were reluctant to challenge Communist forces for fear of losing their own men and did not pursue the CPC with much fervor. In addition, the main KMT forces were preoccupied with annihilating Zhang Guotao's army, which was much larger than Mao's. The massive military retreat of Communist forces lasted a year and covered what Mao estimated as 12,500?km (25,000 Li); it became known as the Long March.[27] The Long March was a military retreat taken on by the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong to evade the pursuit or attack of the Kuomintang army. It consisted of a series of marches, during which numerous Communist armies in the south escaped to the north and west. Over the course of the march from Jiangxi the First Front Army, led by an inexperienced military commission, was on the brink of annihilation by Chiang Kai Shek's troops as their stronghold was in Jiangxi. The Communists, under the command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, \\"escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed over 9,000 kilometers over 370 days\\". The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, and then northwards towards Shaanxi. \\"In November 1935, shortly after settling in northern Shaanxi, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the Red Army. Following a major reshuffling of official roles, Mao became the chairman of the Military Commission, with Zhou and Deng Xiaoping as vice-chairmen.\\" This marked Mao's position as the pre-eminent leader of the Party, with Zhou in second position to him.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe march ended when the CPC reached the interior of Shaanxi. Zhang Guotao's army, which took a different route through northwest China, was largely destroyed by the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his Chinese Muslim allies, the Ma clique. Along the way, the Communist army confiscated property and weapons from local warlords and landlords, while recruiting peasants and the poor, solidifying its appeal to the masses. Of the 90,000ÿ100,000 people who began the Long March from the Soviet Chinese Republic, only around 7,000ÿ8,000 made it to Shaanxi.[28] The remnants of Zhang's forces eventually joined Mao in Shaanxi, but with his army destroyed, Zhang, even as a founding member of the CPC, was never able to challenge Mao's authority. Essentially, the great retreat made Mao the undisputed leader of the Communist Party of China.\\r\\nThe Kuomintang used Khampa troopswho were former banditsto battle the Communist Red Army as it advanced and to undermine local warlords who often refused to fight Communist forces to conserve their own strength. The KMT enlisted 300 \\"Khampa bandits\\" into its Consolatory Commission military in Sichuan, where they were part of the effort of the central government to penetrate and destabilize local Han warlords such as Liu Wenhui. The government was seeking to exert full control over frontier areas against the warlords. Liu had refused to battle the Communists in order to conserve his army. The Consolatory Commission forces were used to battle the Red Army, but they were defeated when their religious leader was captured by the Communists.[29]\\r\\nIn 1936, Zhou Enlai and Zhang Xueliang grew closer, with Zhang even suggesting that he join the CPC. However, this was turned down by the Comintern in the USSR. Later on, Zhou persuaded Zhang and Yang Hucheng, another warlord, to instigate the Xi'an Incident. Chiang was placed under house arrest and forced to stop his attacks on the Red Army, instead focusing on the Japanese threat.\\r\\nThe situation in China in 1929: After the Northern Expedition, the KMT had direct control over east and central China, while the rest of China proper as well as Manchuria was under the control of warlords loyal to the Nationalist government.\\r\\nMap showing the communist-controlled Soviet Zones of China during and after the encirclement campaigns.\\r\\nRoute(s) taken by Communist forces during the Long March.\\r\\nA Communist leader addressing survivors of the Long March.\\r\\nDuring Japan's invasion and occupation of Manchuria Chiang Kai-shek, who saw the CPC as a greater threat, refused to ally with them to fight against the Imperial Japanese Army. Chiang preferred to unite China by eliminating the warlords and CPC forces first. He believed that he was still too weak to launch an offensive to chase out Japan and that China needed time for a military build-up. Only after unification would it be possible for the KMT to mobilize a war against Japan. So he would rather ignore the discontent and anger among Chinese people at his policy of compromise with the Japanese, and ordered KMT generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng to carry out suppression of the CPC; however, their provincial forces suffered significant casualties in battles with the Red Army.ref\\r\\nOn December 12, 1936, the disgruntled Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng conspired to kidnap Chiang and force him into a truce with the CPC. The incident became known as the Xi'an Incident.[30] Both parties suspended fighting to form a Second United Front to focus their energies and fighting against the Japanese.[30] In 1937 Japan launched its full-scale invasion of China and its well-equipped troops overran KMT defenders in northern and coastal China.\\r\\nThe alliance of CPC and KMT was in name only.[31] Unlike the KMT troops, CPC shunned conventional warfare and instead engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Japanese. The level of actual cooperation and coordination between the CPC and KMT during World War II was at best minimal.[31] In the midst of the Second United Front, the CPC and the KMT were still vying for territorial advantage in \\"Free China\\" (i.e., areas not occupied by the Japanese or ruled by Japanese puppet governments such as Manchukuo and the Reorganized National Government of China).[31]\\r\\nThe situation came to a head in late 1940 and early 1941 when clashes between Communist and KMT forces intensified. In December 1940 Chiang demanded that the CPC's New Fourth Army evacuate Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces due to its provocation and harassment of KMT forces in this area. Under intense pressure, the New Fourth Army commanders complied. In 1941 they were ambushed by KMT forces during their evacuation, which led to several thousand deaths.[32] It also ended the Second United Front, which had been formed earlier to fight the Japanese.[32]\\r\\nDespite the intensified clashes between the CPC and KMT, countries such as the US and the Soviet Union attempted to prevent a disastrous civil war. After the New Fourth Army incident, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent special envoy Lauchlin Currie to talk with Chiang Kai-shek and KMT party leaders to express their concern regarding the hostility between the two parties, with Currie stating that the only ones to benefit from a civil war would be the Japanese. In 1941 the Soviet Union, with its closer alliance to the CPC, also sent an imperative telegram to Mao warning that the civil war would also make the situation easier for the Japanese military. Due to the international community's efforts, there was a temporary and superficial peace. In 1943 Chiang attacked the CPC with the propaganda piece China's Destiny, which questioned the CPC's power after the war, while the CPC strongly opposed Chiang's leadership and referred to his regime as fascist in an attempt to generate a negative public image. Both leaders knew that a deadly battle had begun between themselves.[33]\\r\\nIn general, developments in the Second Sino-Japanese War were to the advantage of the CPC, as its guerrilla war tactics had won them popular support within the Japanese-occupied areas, while the KMT's had to defend the country against the main Japanese campaigns to take over the country, since it was the legal Chinese government, and this proved costly to Chiang Kai-shek and his troops. In 1944 Japan launched its last major offensive, Operation Ichi-Go, against the KMT that resulted in the severe weakening of Chiang's forces.[34] Also, the CPC suffered fewer losses through their guerrilla tactics. By the end of the war, the Red Army had grown to more than 1.3 million members, with a separate militia of over 2.6 million members. About one hundred million people lived in CPC-controlled zones.\\r\\nUnder the terms of the Japanese unconditional surrender dictated by the United States, Japanese troops were ordered to surrender to KMT troops and not to the CPC, which was present in some of the occupied areas.[35] In Manchuria, however, where the KMT had no forces, the Japanese surrendered to the Soviet Union. Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese troops to remain at their post to receive the Kuomintang and not surrender their arms to the Communists.[35]\\r\\nThe first post-war peace negotiation was attended by both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in Chongqing from 28 August 1945 and concluded on 10 October 1945 with the signing of Double Tenth Agreement.[36] Both sides stressed the importance of a peaceful reconstruction, but the conference did not produce any concrete results.[36] Battles between the two sides continued even as peace negotiations were in progress, until the agreement was reached in January 1946. However, large campaigns and full-scale confrontations between the CPC and Chiang's troops were temporarily avoided.\\r\\nIn the last month of World War II in East Asia, Soviet forces launched the huge Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation to attack the Japanese 2 million strong Kwantung Army in Manchuria and along the Chinese-Mongolian border.[37] This operation destroyed the fighting capability of Japan's Kwantung Army in just 3 weeks and left the USSR occupying all of Manchuria by the end of the war in a total power vacuum of local Chinese forces. Consequently, the 700,000 Japanese troops stationed in the region surrendered. Later in the year Chiang Kai-shek realized that he lacked the resources to prevent a CPC takeover of Manchuria following the scheduled Soviet departure.[38] He therefore made a deal with the Russians to delay their withdrawal until he had moved enough of his best-trained men and modern material into the region; however, the Russians refused permission for the Nationalist troops to traverse its territory. KMT troops were then airlifted by the US to occupy key cities in North China, while the countryside was already dominated by the CPC. On November 15, 1945, an offensive began with the intent of preventing the CPC from strengthening its already strong base.[39] The Soviets spent the extra time systematically dismantling the extensive Manchurian industrial base (worth up to $2 billion) and shipping it back to their war-ravaged country.[38]\\r\\nYang Kuisong, a Chinese historian, said that in 1945ÿ46, during the Soviet Red Army Manchurian campaign, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin commanded Marshal Rodion Malinovsky to give Mao Zedong most Imperial Japanese Army weapons that were captured.[40]\\r\\nChiang Kai-shek's forces pushed as far as Chinchow (Jinzhou) by November 26, 1945, meeting with little resistance. This was followed by a Communist offensive on the Shantung (Shandong) Peninsula that was largely successful, as all of the peninsula, except what was controlled by the US, fell to the Communists.[39] The truce fell apart in June 1946 when full-scale war between CPC and KMT forces broke out on June 26. China then entered a state of civil war that lasted more than three years.[41]\\r\\nBy the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the power of the Communist Party grew considerably. Their main force grew to 1.2 million troops, with a militia of 2 million. Their \\"Liberated Zone\\" contained 19 base areas, including one-quarter of the country's territory and one-third of its population; this included many important towns and cities. Moreover, the Soviet Union turned over all of its captured Japanese weapons and a substantial amount of their own supplies to the Communists, who received Northeastern China from the Soviets as well.[42]\\r\\nIn March 1946, despite repeated requests from Chiang, the Soviet Red Army under the command of Marshal Malinovsky continued to delay pulling out of Manchuria while Malinovsky secretly told the CPC forces to move in behind them, which led to full-scale war for the control of the Northeast. These favorable conditions also facilitated many changes inside the Communist leadership: the more hard-line faction finally gained the upper hand and defeated the opportunists.[43] Prior to giving control to Communist leaders, on March 27 Soviet diplomats requested a joint venture of industrial development with the Nationalist Party in Manchuria.[44]\\r\\nAlthough General Marshall stated that he knew of no evidence that the CPC was being supplied by the Soviet Union, the CPC was able to utilize a large number of weapons abandoned by the Japanese, including some tanks, but it was not until large numbers of well-trained KMT troops began surrendering and joining the Communist forces that the CPC was finally able to master the hardware.[45][46] However, despite the disadvantage in military hardware, the CPC's ultimate trump card was its land reform policy. The CPC continued to make the irresistible promise in the countryside to the massive number of landless and starving peasants that by fighting for the CPC they would be given their own land once the victory was won.[47]\\r\\nThis strategy enabled the CPC to access an almost unlimited supply of manpower for both combat and logistical purposes, despite suffering heavy casualties throughout many of the war's campaigns. For example, during the Huaihai Campaign alone the CPC was able to mobilize 5,430,000 peasants to fight against the KMT forces.[48]\\r\\nAfter the war with the Japanese ended, Chiang Kai-shek quickly moved KMT troops to newly liberated areas to prevent Communist forces from receiving the Japanese surrender.[42] The US airlifted many KMT troops from central China to the Northeast (Manchuria). President Harry Truman was very clear about what he described as \\"using the Japanese to hold off the Communists\\". In his memoirs he writes:\\r\\nIt was perfectly clear to us that if we told the Japanese to lay down their arms immediately and march to the seaboard, the entire country would be taken over by the Communists. We therefore had to take the unusual step of using the enemy as a garrison until we could airlift Chinese National troops to South China and send Marines to guard the seaports.\\r\\nUsing the pretext of \\"receiving the Japanese surrender\\", business interests within the KMT government occupied most of the banks, factories and commercial properties, which had previously been seized by the Imperial Japanese Army.[42] They also conscripted troops at a brutal pace from the civilian population and hoarded supplies, preparing for a resumption of war with the Communists. These hasty and harsh preparations caused great hardship for the residents of cities such as Shanghai, where the unemployment rate rose dramatically to 37.5%.[42]\\r\\nThe US strongly supported the Kuomintang forces. About 50,000 US soldiers were sent to guard strategic sites in Hupeh and Shandong. The US equipped and trained KMT troops, and transported Japanese and Koreans back to help KMT forces to occupy liberated zones as well as to contain Communist-controlled areas.[42] American aid included substantial amounts of mostly surplus military supplies; loans were made to the KMT.[50] Within less than two years after the Sino-Japanese War, the KMT had received $4.43 billion from the USmost of which was military aid.[42]\\r\\nSituation in 1947\\r\\nSituation in the fall of 1948\\r\\nSituation in the winter of 1948 and 1949\\r\\nSituation in April to October 1949\\r\\nWith the breakdown of talks, all-out war resumed. This stage is referred to in mainland China and Communist historiography as the \\"War of Liberation\\" (Chinese: vؗMV; pinyin: Jifng Zhnzhng). On 20 July 1946 Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale assault on Communist territory with 113 brigades (1.6 million troops).[42] This marked the final phase of the Chinese Civil War.\\r\\nKnowing their disadvantages in manpower and equipment, the CPC executed a \\"passive defense\\" strategy. It avoided the strong points of the KMT army and was prepared to abandon territory in order to preserve its forces. In most cases the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities. The CPC also attempted to wear out the KMT forces as much as possible. This tactic seemed to be successful; after a year, the power balance became more favorable to the CPC. They wiped out 1.12 million KMT troops, while their strength grew to about two million men.[42]\\r\\nIn March 1947 the KMT achieved a symbolic victory by seizing the CPC capital of Yan'an.[51] The Communists counterattacked soon afterwards; on 30 June 1947 CPC troops crossed the Yellow River and moved to the Dabie Mountains area, restored and developed the Central Plain. At the same time, Communist forces also began to counterattack in Northeastern China, North China and East China.[42]\\r\\nBy late 1948, the CPC eventually captured the northern cities of Shenyang and Changchun and seized control of the Northeast after suffering numerous setbacks while trying to take the cities, with the decisive Liaoshen Campaign.[52] The New 1st Army, regarded as the best KMT army, was forced to surrender after the CPC conducted a brutal six-month siege of Changchun that resulted in more than 150,000 civilian deaths from starvation.[53]\\r\\nThe capture of large KMT units provided the CPC with the tanks, heavy artillery and other combined-arms assets needed to execute offensive operations south of the Great Wall. By April 1948 the city of Luoyang fell, cutting the KMT army off from Xi'an.[54] Following a fierce battle, the CPC captured Jinan and Shandong province on September 24, 1948. The Huaihai Campaign of late 1948 and early 1949 secured east-central China for the CPC.[52] The outcome of these encounters were decisive for the military outcome of the civil war.[52]\\r\\nThe Pingjin Campaign resulted in the Communist conquest of northern China. It lasted 64 days, from November 21, 1948, to January 31, 1949.[55] The PLA suffered heavy casualties while securing Zhangjiakou, Tianjin along with its port and garrison at Dagu and Beiping.[55] The CPC brought 890,000 troops from the northeast to oppose some 600,000 KMT troops.[54] There were 40,000 CPC casualties at Zhangjiakou alone. They in turn killed, wounded or captured some 520,000 KMT during the campaign.[55]\\r\\nAfter the decisive Liaoshen, Huaihai and Pingjin campaigns, the CPC wiped out 144 regular and 29 non-regular KMT divisions, including 1.54 million veteran KMT troops. This effectively smashed the backbone of the KMT army.[42] Stalin wanted a coalition government in China, and tried to stop Mao from crossing the Yangtze River and moving South.[56] Mao rejected Stalin's position and on 21 April, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On 23 April they captured the KMT's capital, Nanjing.[27] The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to Taiwan on December 10. By late 1949 the People's Liberation Army was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet was left. In addition, the Ili Rebellion was a Soviet-backed revolt by the Second East Turkestan Republic against the KMT from 1944ÿ49, as the Mongolians in the People's Republic were in a border dispute with the Republic of China. A Chinese Muslim Hui cavalry regiment, the 14th Tungan Cavalry, was sent by the Chinese government to attack Mongol and Soviet positions along the border during the Pei-ta-shan Incident.[57][58]\\r\\nThe Kuomintang made several last-ditch attempts to use Khampa troops against the Communists in southwest China. The Kuomintang formulated a plan in which three Khampa divisions would be assisted by the Panchen Lama to oppose the Communists.[59] Kuomintang intelligence reported that some Tibetan tusi chiefs and the Khampa Su Yonghe controlled 80,000 troops in Sichuan, Qinghai and Tibet. They hoped to use them against the Communist army.[60]\\r\\nOn October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China with its capital at Beiping, which was renamed Beijing. Chiang Kai-shek and approximately two million Nationalist Chinese retreated from mainland China to the island of Taiwan in December after the loss of Sichuan. There remained only isolated pockets of resistance, notably in Sichuan (ending soon after the fall of Chengdu on December 10, 1949) and in the far south.[61]\\r\\nA PRC attempt to take the ROC-controlled island of Quemoy was thwarted in the Battle of Kuningtou, halting the PLA advance towards Taiwan.[62] In December 1949, Chiang proclaimed Taipei the temporary capital of the Republic of China and continued to assert his government as the sole legitimate authority in China.\\r\\nThe Communists' other amphibious operations of 1950 were more successful: they led to the Communist conquest of Hainan Island in April 1950, capture of Wanshan Islands off the Guangdong coast (MayÿAugust 1950) and of Zhoushan Island off Zhejiang (May 1950).[63]\\r\\nMost observers expected Chiang's government to eventually fall to the imminent invasion of Taiwan by the Communists, and the US initially showed no interest in supporting Chiang's government in its final stand. US President Harry S. Truman announced on January 5, 1950, that the United States would not become involved in any dispute about Taiwan Strait, and that he would not intervene in the event of an attack by the PRC.[64] The situation quickly changed after the onset of the Korean War in June 1950. This led to changing political climate in the US, and President Truman ordered the United States Seventh Fleet to sail to the Taiwan Strait to enforce containment of potential Communist advance.[65]\\r\\nIn June 1949 the ROC declared a \\"closure\\" of all mainland China ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships. The closure was from a point north of the mouth of Min River in Fujian to the mouth of the Liao River in Liaoning.[66] Since mainland China's railroad network was underdeveloped, north-south trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland China fishermen.\\r\\nAfter losing mainland China, a group of approximately 3,000 KMT Central soldiers retreated to Burma and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south China during the Kuomintang Islamic Insurgency in China (1950ÿ1958) and Campaign at the ChinaÿBurma Border. Their leader, Gen. Li Mi, was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of Yunnan. Initially, the US supported these remnants and the Central Intelligence Agency provided them with military aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the United Nations in 1953, the US began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954 nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and General Li declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times to maintain a base close to China.\\r\\nAfter the ROC complained to the United Nations against the Soviet Union for violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance to support the CPC, the UN General Assembly Resolution 505 was adopted on February 1, 1952, condemning the Soviet Union.\\r\\nThough viewed as a military liability by the US, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in Fujian as vital for any future campaign to defeat the PRC and retake mainland China. On September 3, 1954, the First Taiwan Strait Crisis began when the PLA started shelling Quemoy and threatened to take the Dachen Islands in Zhejiang.[66] On January 20, 1955, the PLA took nearby Yijiangshan Island, with the entire ROC garrison of 720 troops killed or wounded defending the island. On January 24 of the same year, the United States Congress passed the Formosa Resolution authorizing the President to defend the ROC's offshore islands.[66] The First Taiwan Straits crisis ended in March 1955 when the PLA ceased its bombardment. The crisis was brought to a close during the Bandung conference.[66]\\r\\nThe Second Taiwan Strait Crisis began on August 23, 1958 with air and naval engagements between PRC and ROC forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of Quemoy (by the PRC) and Amoy (by the ROC), and ended on November of the same year.[66] PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands from ROC supply ships. Though the US rejected Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to bomb mainland China artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided amphibious assault ships to land supplies, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On September 7 the US escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing.\\r\\nThe Third Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995ÿ96 escalated tensions between both sides when the PRC tested a series of missiles not far from Taiwan, although, arguably, Beijing ran the test to shift the 1996 presidential election vote in favor of the KMT, already facing a challenge from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party which did not agree with the \\"One China Policy\\" shared by the CPC and KMT.[67]\\r\\nOn October 25, 1971, the United Nations General Assembly admitted the PRC and expelled the ROC, which had been a founding member of the United Nations and was one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, representatives of Chiang Kai-shek by refusing to recognise their accreditations as representatives of China. Recognition for the People's Republic of China soon followed from most other governments, including the United States.\\r\\nBy 1984 PRC and ROC had public contacts with each other and cross-straits trade and investment has been growing ever since. The war was officially declared over by the ROC in 1991.[68] Despite the end of the hostilities, the two sides have never signed any agreement or treaty to officially end the war. According to Mao Zedong, there were three ways of \\"staving off imperialist intervention in the short term\\" during the continuation of the Chinese Revolution. The first was through a rapid completion of the military takeover of the country, and through showing determination and strength against \\"foreign attempts at challenging the new regime along its borders\\". The second was by \\"formalising a comprehensive military alliance with the Soviet Union\\", which would dedicate Soviet power to directly defending China against its enemies; this aspect became extensively significant given the backdrop of the start of the Cold War. And finally the regime had to \\"root out its domestic opponents?: the heads of secret societies, religious sects, independent unions, or tribal and ethic organisations.\\" By destroying the basis of domestic reaction, Mao believed a safer world for the Chinese revolution to spread in would come into existence.[69]\\r\\nUnder the new ROC president Lee Teng-hui, the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion was renounced in May 1991, thus ending the chances of the Kuomintang's conquest to retake the mainland.\\r\\nWith the election in 2000 of Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian, a party other than the KMT gained the presidency for the first time in Taiwan. The new president did not share the Chinese nationalist ideology of the KMT and CPC. This led to tension between the two sides, although trade and other ties such as the 2005 Pan-Blue visit continued to increase.\\r\\nSince the election of President Ma Ying-jeou (KMT) in 2008, significant warming of relations has resumed between Taipei and Beijing, with high-level exchanges between the semi-official diplomatic organizations of both states such as the Chen-Chiang summit series. Although the Taiwan straits remain a potential flash point, regular direct air links were established in 2009.[11]\\r\\nHistorian Odd Arne Westad says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-shek and also because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against the Japanese. Meanwhile, the Communists targeted different groups, such as peasants, and brought them to its corner.[70]\\r\\nChiang wrote in his diary in June 1948 that the KMT had failed not because of external enemies but because of rot from within.[71]\\r\\nThe USSR generally supported Chiang's forces. Stalin distrusted Mao, tried to block him from leadership as late as 1942, and worried that Mao would become an independent rival force in world communism.[72]\\r\\nStrong American support for the Nationalists was hedged with the failure of the Marshall Mission, and then stopped completely mainly because of KMT corruption [73] (such as the notorious Yangtze Development Corporation [74] controlled by H.H. Kung and T. V. Soong's family) [75] and KMT's military setback in Northeast China.\\r\\nCommunist land reform policy promised poor peasants farmland from their landlords, ensuring popular support for the PLA.\\r\\nThe main advantage of the Chinese Communist Party was the \\"extraordinary cohesion\\" within the top level of its leadership. These skills were not only secured from defections that came about during difficult times but also coupled with \\"communications and top level debates over tactics\\". A big addition to this was the charismatic style of leadership of Mao Zedong which created a \\"unity of purpose\\" and a \\"unity of command\\" which the KMT lacked majorly. Apart from that the CPC had mastered the manipulation of local politics to their benefit, this was also derived from their propaganda skills that had also been decentralised successfully. By \\"portraying their opponents as enemies of all groups of Chinese\\" and itself as \\"defenders of the nation\\" and people (given the backdrop of the war with Japan).[76]\\r\\nIn the Chinese Civil War after 1945, the economy in the ROC areas collapsed because of hyperinflation and the failure of price controls by the ROC government and financial reforms; the Gold Yuan devaluated sharply in late 1948 [77] and resulted in the ROC government losing the support of the cities' middle classes. In the meantime, the Communists continued their relentless land reform (land redistribution) programs to win the support of the population in the countryside.\\r\\nDuring the war both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities, with millions of non-combatants deliberately killed by both sides.[78] Benjamin Valentino has estimated atrocities in the Chinese Civil War resulted in the death of between 1.8 million and 3.5 million people between 1927 and 1949. Atrocities include deaths from forced conscription and massacres.[79]\\r\\n Communist Party / ?People's Republic of China ( Red Army L  8th Route Army, N4A, etc. L  People's Liberation Army)\\r\\nXia L Shang L Zhou L Qin L Han L 3 Kingdoms L Jn / 16 Kingdoms L N. & S.

The German title Munch gave these works is Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature). The works show a figure with an agonized expression against a landscape with a tumultuous orange sky. Arthur Lubow has described The Scream as \\"an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time.\\"[1]\\r\\nEdvard Munch created the four versions in various media. The National Gallery in Oslo, Norway, holds one of two painted versions (1893, shown here). The Munch Museum holds the other painted version (1910, see gallery, below) and a pastel version from 1893. These three versions have not traveled for years,[2] though the pastel version was on display in a temporary exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in 2015.[3]\\r\\nThe fourth version (pastel, 1895) was sold for $119,922,600 at Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern Art auction on 2 May 2012 to financier Leon Black,[4][5] the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction.[6] The pastel was on display in the Museum of Modern Art in New York from October 2012 to April 2013.[7]\\r\\nAlso in 1895, Munch created a lithograph stone of the image. Of the lithograph prints produced by Munch, several examples survive.[8] Only approximately four dozen prints were made before the original stone was resurfaced by the printer in Munch's absence.[9]\\r\\nThe Scream has been the target of several high-profile art thefts. In 1994, the version in the National Gallery was stolen. It was recovered several months later. In 2004, both The Scream and Madonna were stolen from the Munch Museum, and both were recovered two years later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original German title given by Munch to his work was Der Schrei der Natur (\\"The Scream of Nature\\"). The Norwegian title, Skrik, is cognate with the English \\"shriek\\".[citation needed][clarification needed] Occasionally, the painting also has been called The Cry.\\r\\nIn his diary in an entry headed \\"Nice 22 January 1892\\", Munch wrote:\\r\\nI was walking along the road with two friends?ÿ the sun was setting?ÿ suddenly the sky turned blood red?ÿ I paused, feeling exhausted, and leaned on the fence?ÿ there was blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black fjord and the city?ÿ my friends walked on, and I stood there trembling with anxiety?ÿ and I sensed an infinite scream passing through nature.[10]\\r\\nHe later described his inspiration for the image:\\r\\nOne evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below. I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjordthe sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red. I sensed a scream passing through nature; it seemed to me that I heard the scream. I painted this picture, painted the clouds as actual blood. The color shrieked. This became The Scream.[11]\\r\\nAmong theories advanced to account for the reddish sky in the background is the artist's memory of the effects of the powerful volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which deeply tinted sunset skies red in parts of the Western hemisphere for months during 1883 and 1884, about a decade before Munch painted The Scream.[12] This explanation has been disputed by scholars, who note that Munch was an expressive painter and was not primarily interested in literal renderings of what he had seen. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the proximity of both a slaughterhouse and a lunatic asylum to the site depicted in the painting may have offered some inspiration.[13] The scene was identified as being the view from a road overlooking Oslo, the Oslofjord and Hoved?ya, from the hill of Ekeberg.[14] At the time of painting the work, Munch's manic depressive sister Laura Catherine was a patient at the asylum at the foot of Ekeberg.\\r\\nIn 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum suggested that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting was inspired by a Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?.[15] In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting.[16] Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.[17]\\r\\nThe imagery of The Scream has been compared to that which an individual suffering from depersonalization disorder experiences, a feeling of distortion of the environment and one's self,[18][19] and also facial pain in the form of Trigeminal neuralgia.[20]\\r\\nThe material composition of the 1893 painted version was examined in 2010.[21] The pigment analysis revealed the use of cadmium yellow, vermilion, ultramarine and viridian among other pigments of the 19th century.[22]\\r\\nThe Scream has been the target of a number of thefts and theft attempts. Some damage has been suffered in these thefts.\\r\\nOn 12 February 1994, the same day as the opening of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, two men broke into the National Gallery, Oslo, and stole its version of The Scream, leaving a note reading \\"Thanks for the poor security\\".[23][24] The painting had been moved down to a second-story gallery[25] as part of the Olympic festivities.[26] After the gallery refused to pay a ransom demand of US$1 million in March 1994, Norwegian police set up a sting operation with assistance from the British police (SO10) and the Getty Museum and the painting was recovered undamaged on 7 May 1994.[25] In January 1996, four men were convicted in connection with the theft, including P?l Enger, who had been convicted of stealing Munch's Vampire in 1988.[27] They were released on appeal on legal grounds: the British agents involved in the sting operation had entered Norway under false identities.[28]\\r\\nThe 1910 version of The Scream was stolen on 22 August 2004, during daylight hours, when masked gunmen entered the Munch Museum in Oslo and stole it and Munch's Madonna.[29] A bystander photographed the robbers as they escaped to their car with the artwork. On 8 April 2005, Norwegian police arrested a suspect in connection with the theft, but the paintings remained missing and it was rumored that they had been burned by the thieves to destroy evidence.[30][31] On 1 June 2005, with four suspects already in custody in connection with the crime, the city government of Oslo offered a reward of 2 million Norwegian krone (roughly US$313,500 or ?231,200) for information that could help locate the paintings.[32] Although the paintings remained missing, six men went on trial in early 2006, variously charged with either helping to plan or participating in the robbery. Three of the men were convicted and sentenced to between four and eight years in prison in May 2006, and two of the convicted, Bj?rn Hoen and Petter Tharaldsen, were also ordered to pay compensation of 750 million kroner (roughly US$117.6 million or ?86.7 million) to the City of Oslo.[33] The Munch Museum was closed for ten months for a security overhaul.[34]\\r\\nOn 31 August 2006, Norwegian police announced that a police operation had recovered both The Scream and Madonna, but did not reveal detailed circumstances of the recovery. The paintings were said to be in a better-than-expected condition. \\"We are 100 percent certain they are the originals,\\" police chief Iver Stensrud told a news conference. \\"The damage was much less than feared.\\"[35][36] Munch Museum director Ingebj?rg Ydstie confirmed the condition of the paintings, saying it was much better than expected and that the damage could be repaired.[37] The Scream had moisture damage on the lower left corner, while Madonna suffered several tears on the right side of the painting as well as two holes in Madonna's arm.[38] Before repairs and restoration began, the paintings were put on public display by the Munch Museum beginning 27 September 2006. During the five-day exhibition, 5,500 people viewed the damaged paintings. The conserved works went back on display on 23 May 2008, when the exhibition \\"Scream and Madonna? Revisited\\" at the Munch Museum in Oslo displayed the paintings together.[39] Some damage to The Scream may prove impossible to repair, but the overall integrity of the work has not been compromised.[40][41]\\r\\nThe 1895 pastel-on-board version of the painting, owned by Norwegian businessman Petter Olsen, sold at Sotheby's in London for a record price of nearly US$120 million at auction on 2 May 2012.[42][43] The bidding started at $40 million and lasted for over 12 minutes when American businessman Leon Black by phone gave the final offer of US$119,922,500, including the buyer's premium.[5] Sotheby's said the painting was the most colorful and vibrant of the four versions painted by Munch and the only version whose frame was hand-painted by the artist to include his poem, detailing the work's inspiration.[2] After the sale, Sotheby's auctioneer Tobias Meyer said the painting was \\"worth every penny\\", adding: \\"It is one of the great icons of art in the world and whoever bought it should be congratulated.\\"[44]\\r\\nThe previous record for the most expensive work of art sold at auction had been held by Picasso's Nude, Green Leaves and Bust, which went for US$106.5 million at Christie's two years prior on 4 May 2010.[45] When accounting for inflation, the highest price paid for art at an auction is still held by Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet, which sold for $82.5 million in 1990, or about $155 million 2012 dollars.[46] There have been reports that The Card Players, by Czanne, sold privately for $250m in 2011,[47][48] which can not be verified for the establishment of a record price.\\r\\nIn the late twentieth century, The Scream was imitated, parodied, and (following its copyright expiration) outright copied, which led to it acquiring an iconic status in popular culture. It was used on the cover of some editions of Arthur Janov's book The Primal Scream.[49] In 1983ÿ1984, pop artist Andy Warhol made a series of silk prints copying works by Munch, including The Scream. His stated intention was to desacralize the painting by making it into a mass-reproducible object. Munch had already begun that process, however, by making a lithograph of the work for reproduction. Err܇'s ironic and irreverent treatment of Munch's masterpiece in his acrylic paintings The Second Scream (1967) and Ding Dong (1979) is considered a characteristic of post-modern art.[50] The expression of Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) in the poster for the movie Home Alone was inspired by The Scream. Cartoonist Gary Larson included a \\"tribute\\" to The Scream (entitled The Whine) in his Wiener Dog Art painting and cartoon compilation, in which the central figure is replaced by a howling dachshund. The Scream has been used in advertising, in cartoons such as The Simpsons, films, and on television.\\r\\nThe principal alien antagonists depicted in the 2011 BBC series of Doctor Who, named \\"The Silence\\", have an appearance partially based on The Scream.[51] In 2001, Big Finish Productions did an audio, Dust Breeding, featuring the Seventh Doctor attempting to acquire The Scream from an art gallery in the future where it was destined to disappear in mysterious circumstances, but learned that it contained an ancient psychic weapon known as the Warp Core, which became trapped in the artist's mind until he 'exorcised' the Warp Core into the painting, with the Master's efforts to take control of the weapon damaging his body and his second attempt resulting in the destruction of the colony.\\r\\nThe Ghostface mask worn by the primary antagonists of the Scream series of horror movies is based on the painting, and was created by Brigitte Sleiertin, a Fun World employee, as a Halloween costume, prior to being discovered by Marianne Maddalena and Wes Craven for the film.[52]\\r\\nIn the Jonathan Creek episode \\"The Coonskin Cap\\", Jonathan works out a crucial clue by looking at an image of The Scream being used for a backdrop, reflecting how a change in perspective can mean that people perceive the painting as someone hearing a scream as well as someone screaming, allowing him to work out the circumstances behind a woman's death.\\r\\nIn 2013, The Scream was one of four paintings that the Norwegian postal service chose for a series of stamps marking the 150th anniversary of Edvard Munchs birth.[53]\\r\\nA patient resource group for trigeminal neuralgia (which has been described as the most painful condition in existence) have also adopted the image as a symbol of the condition.[54]\\r\\nIn \\"The Missing Scream of Munch\\", an episode of the anime Detective Conan, the disappearance of The Scream provides the main part of the plot.[55]\\r\\nThe painting features in chapter 12 of Philip K. Dick's novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The two bounty hunters, Deckard and Resch are on the trail of Luba Luft, a suspect android. The painting is described as follows: \\"The painting showed a hairless, oppressed creature with a head like an inverted pear, its hands clapped in horror to its ears, its mouth open in a vast soundless scream. Twisted ripples of the creature's torment, echoes of its cry, flooded out into the air surrounding it: the man or woman, whichever it was, had become contained by its own howl.\\"\\r\\nCharacters rendered in an art style explicitly resembling the painting are frequently drawn in mangas written by Rumiko Takahashi, such as in Ranma 1/2. Takahashi has expressed fondness for the work.[56]\\r\\nIn most Unicode emoji renderings, U+1F631 ?? Face Screaming in Fear is made to resemble the subject of the painting.[57]\\r\\nA simplified version of the subject of the painting is one of the pictographs considered by the US Department of Energy for use as a non-language-specific symbol of danger in order to warn future human civilizations of the presence of radioactive waste.[58]\\r\\nIn 2016, Good Smile Company produced a figma action figure based on The Scream.[59]\\r\\n1893: pastel on cardboard.

The choice of Swahili, an East African language, reflects its status as a symbol of Pan-Africanism, especially in the 1960s, although most of the Atlantic slave trade that brought African people to America originated in West Africa.[4][5] First fruits festivals exist in Southern Africa, celebrated in December/January with the southern solstice, and Karenga was partly inspired by an account he read of the Zulu festival Umkhosi Wokweshwama.[6] It was decided to spell the holiday's name with an additional \\"a\\" so that it would have a symbolic seven letters.[7]\\r\\nKwanzaa is a celebration with its roots in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s. Karenga established it to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage by uniting in meditation and study of African traditions and Nguzo Saba, the \\"seven principles of African Heritage,\\" which Karenga said \\"is a communitarian African philosophy.\\" For Karenga, a major figure in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the creation of such holidays also underscored an essential premise \\"you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The cultural revolution gives identity, purpose and direction.\\"[8]\\r\\nDuring the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas. He believed Jesus was psychotic and Christianity was a \\"white\\" religion black people should shun.[9] However, as Kwanzaa gained mainstream adherents, Karenga altered his position so practicing Christians would not be alienated, then stating in the 1997, Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture, \\"Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday.\\"[10] Many African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.[11]\\r\\nKwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or Nguzo Saba (originally Nguzu Sabathe seven principles of African Heritage), which Karenga said \\"is a communitarian African philosophy,\\" consisting of what Karenga called \\"the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world.\\" These seven principles comprise Kawaida, a Swahili word meaning \\"common\\". Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows:[12]\\r\\nKwanzaa celebratory symbols include a mat (Mkeka) on which other symbols are placed: a Kinara (candle holder), Mishumaa Saba (seven candles), mazao (crops), Muhindi (corn), a Kikombe cha Umoja (unity cup) for commemorating and giving shukrani (thanks) to African Ancestors, and Zawadi (gifts). Supplemental representations include a Nguzo Saba poster,[13] the black, red, and green bendera (flag), and African books and artworks ÿ all to represent values and concepts reflective of African culture and contribution to community building and reinforcement.[14] Corn is the primary symbol for both decoration and celebratory dining.\\r\\nFamilies celebrating Kwanzaa decorate their households with objects of art, colorful African cloth such as kente, especially the wearing of kaftans by women, and fresh fruits that represent African idealism. It is customary to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice, Kikombe cha Umoja, passed around to all celebrants. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa.[15] The holiday greeting is \\"Joyous Kwanzaa\\".[16][17][18]\\r\\nA Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast (karamu). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is Habari Gani?[19] which is Swahili for \\"How are you?\\"[20]\\r\\nAt first, observers of Kwanzaa avoided the mixing of the holiday or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as doing so would violate the principle of kujichagulia (self-determination) and thus violate the integrity of the holiday, which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, many African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with Christmas and New Year's.[21] Frequently, both Christmas trees and kinaras, the traditional candle holder symbolic of African American roots, share space in Kwanzaa-celebrating households. For people who celebrate both holidays, Kwanzaa is an opportunity to incorporate elements of their particular ethnic heritage into holiday observances and celebrations of Christmas.\\r\\nCultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song and poetry.[22][23][24]\\r\\nThe National Retail Federation has sponsored a marketing survey on winter holidays since 2004, and in 2015 found that 1.9% of those polled planned to celebrate Kwanzaa ÿ about six million people.[25] In a 2006 speech, Maulana Karenga asserted that 28 million people celebrate Kwanzaa. He has always claimed it is celebrated all over the world.[1] Lee D. Baker puts the number at 12 million.[26] The African American Cultural Center claimed 30 million in 2009.[27][28]\\r\\nAccording to University of Minnesota Professor Keith Mayes, the author of Kwanzaa: Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition, the popularity within the U.S. has \\"leveled off\\" as the black power movement there has declined, and as of 2009 between 500 thousand and two million Americans celebrated Kwanzaa, or between one and five percent of African Americans. Mayes added that white institutions now celebrate it.[15]\\r\\nStarting in the 1990s, the holiday became increasingly commercialized, with the first Hallmark Card being sold in 1992,[29] and there has been concern about this damaging the holiday's values.[30] The holiday also saw a greater public recognition as the first Kwanzaa stamp, designed by Synthia Saint James, was issued by the United States Post Office in 1997, and in the same year Bill Clinton gave the first presidential declaration marking the holiday.[31][32]\\r\\nThe holiday has also spread to Canada and is celebrated by Black Canadians in a similar fashion as in the United States.[33] According to the Language Portal of Canada, \\"this fairly new tradition has [also] gained in popularity in France, Great Britain, Jamaica and Brazil\\".[34]\\r\\nIn Brazil, in recent years the term Kwanzaa has been applied by a few institutions as a synonym for the festivities of the Black Awareness Day, commemorated on November 20 in honor of Zumbi dos Palmares,[35][36] having little to do with the celebration as it was originally conceived.\\r\\nStjepan Me?trovi?, a sociology professor at the Texas A&M University, sees Kwanzaa as an example of postmodernism. According to Me?trovi?, modern society has discarded ancient traditions as racist, sexist or otherwise oppressive, but since living in a world where nothing is true is too terrifying to most people, \\"nice\\" and \\"synthetic\\" traditions like Kwanzaa have been created to cope with the nihilistic, individualistic modern society.[37]\\r\\nMaya Angelou narrated a documentary film about Kwanzaa, The Black Candle, written and directed by M.K.

He was the first poet to be buried in Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey.\\r\\nWhile he achieved fame during his lifetime as an author, philosopher, and astronomer, composing a scientific treatise on the astrolabe for his ten-year-old son Lewis, Chaucer also maintained an active career in the civil service as a bureaucrat, courtier and diplomat. Among his many works are The Book of the Duchess, The House of Fame, The Legend of Good Women and Troilus and Criseyde. He is best known today for The Canterbury Tales.\\r\\nChaucer's work was crucial in legitimizing the literary use of the Middle English vernacular at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were French and Latin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeoffrey Chaucer was born in London sometime around 1343, though the precise date and location of his birth remain unknown. His father and grandfather were both London vintners; several previous generations had been merchants in Ipswich. (His family name derives from the French chausseur, meaning \\"shoemaker\\".)[2] In 1324 John Chaucer, Geoffrey's father, was kidnapped by an aunt in the hope of marrying the twelve-year-old boy to her daughter in an attempt to keep property in Ipswich. The aunt was imprisoned and the S250 fine levied suggests that the family was financially secure, maybe even elite.[3] John Chaucer married Agnes Copton, who, in 1349, inherited properties including 24 shops in London from her uncle, Hamo de Copton, who is described in a will dated 3 April 1354 and listed in the City Hustings Roll as \\"moneyer\\"; he was said to be moneyer at the Tower of London. In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, dated June 1380, Geoffrey Chaucer refers to himself as me Galfridum Chaucer, filium Johannis Chaucer, Vinetarii, Londonie'.\\r\\nWhile records concerning the lives of his contemporary poets, William Langland and the Pearl Poet, are practically non-existent, since Chaucer was a public servant, his official life is very well documented, with nearly five hundred written items testifying to his career. The first of the \\"Chaucer Life Records\\" appears in 1357, in the household accounts of Elizabeth de Burgh, the Countess of Ulster, when he became the noblewoman's page through his father's connections,[4] a common medieval form of apprenticeship for boys into knighthood or prestige appointments. The countess was married to Lionel, Duke of Clarence, the second surviving son of the king, Edward III, and the position brought the teenage Chaucer into the close court circle, where he was to remain for the rest of his life. He also worked as a courtier, a diplomat, and a civil servant, as well as working for the king from 1389 to 1391 as Clerk of the King's Works.[5]\\r\\nIn 1359, in the early stages of the Hundred Years' War, Edward III invaded France and Chaucer travelled with Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, Elizabeth's husband, as part of the English army. In 1360, he was captured during the siege of Rheims. Edward paid S16 for his ransom,[6] a considerable sum, and Chaucer was released.\\r\\nAfter this, Chaucer's life is uncertain, but he seems to have travelled in France, Spain, and Flanders, possibly as a messenger and perhaps even going on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Around 1366, Chaucer married Philippa (de) Roet. She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III's queen, Philippa of Hainault, and a sister of Katherine Swynford, who later (c. 1396) became the third wife of John of Gaunt. It is uncertain how many children Chaucer and Philippa had, but three or four are most commonly cited. His son, Thomas Chaucer, had an illustrious career, as chief butler to four kings, envoy to France, and Speaker of the House of Commons. Thomas's daughter, Alice, married the Duke of Suffolk. Thomas's great-grandson (Geoffrey's great-great-grandson), John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, was the heir to the throne designated by Richard III before he was deposed. Geoffrey's other children probably included Elizabeth Chaucy, a nun at Barking Abbey,[7][8] Agnes, an attendant at Henry IV's coronation; and another son, Lewis Chaucer. Chaucer's \\"Treatise on the Astrolabe\\" was written for Lewis.[9]\\r\\nAccording to tradition, Chaucer studied law in the Inner Temple (an Inn of Court) at this time. He became a member of the royal court of Edward III as a valet de chambre, yeoman, or esquire on 20 June 1367, a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks. His wife also received a pension for court employment. He travelled abroad many times, at least some of them in his role as a valet. In 1368, he may have attended the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp to Violante Visconti, daughter of Galeazzo II Visconti, in Milan. Two other literary stars of the era were in attendance: Jean Froissart and Petrarch. Around this time, Chaucer is believed to have written The Book of the Duchess in honour of Blanche of Lancaster, the late wife of John of Gaunt, who died in 1369 of the plague.[10]\\r\\nChaucer travelled to Picardy the next year as part of a military expedition; in 1373 he visited Genoa and Florence. Numerous scholars such as Skeat, Boitani, and Rowland[11] suggested that, on this Italian trip, he came into contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio. They introduced him to medieval Italian poetry, the forms and stories of which he would use later.[12][13] The purposes of a voyage in 1377 are mysterious, as details within the historical record conflict. Later documents suggest it was a mission, along with Jean Froissart, to arrange a marriage between the future King Richard II and a French princess, thereby ending the Hundred Years War. If this was the purpose of their trip, they seem to have been unsuccessful, as no wedding occurred.\\r\\nIn 1378, Richard II sent Chaucer as an envoy (secret dispatch) to the Visconti and to Sir John Hawkwood, English condottiere (mercenary leader) in Milan. It has been speculated that it was Hawkwood on whom Chaucer based his character the Knight in the Canterbury Tales, for a description matches that of a 14th-century condottiere.\\r\\nA possible indication that his career as a writer was appreciated came when Edward III granted Chaucer \\"a gallon of wine daily for the rest of his life\\" for some unspecified task. This was an unusual grant, but given on a day of celebration, St George's Day, 1374, when artistic endeavours were traditionally rewarded, it is assumed to have been another early poetic work. It is not known which, if any, of Chaucer's extant works prompted the reward, but the suggestion of him as poet to a king places him as a precursor to later poets laureate. Chaucer continued to collect the liquid stipend until Richard II came to power, after which it was converted to a monetary grant on 18 April 1378.\\r\\nChaucer obtained the very substantial job of comptroller of the customs for the port of London, which he began on 8 June 1374.[14] He must have been suited for the role as he continued in it for twelve years, a long time in such a post at that time. His life goes undocumented for much of the next ten years, but it is believed that he wrote (or began) most of his famous works during this period. He was mentioned in law papers of 4 May 1380, involved in the raptus of Cecilia Chaumpaigne. What raptus means is unclear, but the incident seems to have been resolved quickly and did not leave a stain on Chaucer's reputation. It is not known if Chaucer was in the city of London at the time of the Peasants' Revolt, but if he was, he would have seen its leaders pass almost directly under his apartment window at Aldgate.[15]\\r\\nWhile still working as comptroller, Chaucer appears to have moved to Kent, being appointed as one of the commissioners of peace for Kent, at a time when French invasion was a possibility. He is thought to have started work on The Canterbury Tales in the early 1380s. He also became a Member of Parliament for Kent in 1386, and attended the 'Wonderful Parliament' that year. He appears to have been present at most of the 71 days it sat, for which he was paid S24 9s.[16] On 15 October that year, he gave a deposition in the case of Scrope v. Grosvenor.[17] There is no further reference after this date to Philippa, Chaucer's wife, and she is presumed to have died in 1387. He survived the political upheavals caused by the Lords Appellants, despite the fact that Chaucer knew some of the men executed over the affair quite well.\\r\\nOn 12 July 1389, Chaucer was appointed the clerk of the king's works, a sort of foreman organising most of the king's building projects.[18] No major works were begun during his tenure, but he did conduct repairs on Westminster Palace, St. George's Chapel, Windsor, continue building the wharf at the Tower of London, and build the stands for a tournament held in 1390. It may have been a difficult job, but it paid well: two shillings a day, more than three times his salary as a comptroller. Chaucer was also appointed keeper of the lodge at the King's park in Feckenham, which was a largely honorary appointment.[19]\\r\\nIn September 1390, records say that he was robbed, and possibly injured, while conducting the business, and it was shortly after, on 17 June 1391, that he stopped working in this capacity. Almost immediately, on 22 June, he began as Deputy Forester in the royal forest of Petherton Park in North Petherton, Somerset.[20] This was no sinecure, with maintenance an important part of the job, although there were many opportunities to derive profit. He was granted an annual pension of twenty pounds by Richard II in 1394.[21] It is believed that Chaucer stopped work on the Canterbury Tales sometime towards the end of this decade.\\r\\nNot long after the overthrow of his patron, Richard II, in 1399, Chaucer's name fades from the historical record. The last few records of his life show his pension renewed by the new king, and his taking of a lease on a residence within the close of Westminster Abbey on 24 December 1399.[22] Although Henry IV renewed the grants assigned to Chaucer by Richard, Chaucer's own The Complaint of Chaucer to his Purse hints that the grants might not have been paid. The last mention of Chaucer is on 5 June 1400, when some monies owed to him were paid.\\r\\nHe is believed to have died of unknown causes on 25 October 1400, but there is no firm evidence for this date, as it comes from the engraving on his tomb, erected more than one hundred years after his death. There is some speculationmost recently in Terry Jones' book Who Murdered Chaucer? : A Medieval Mysterythat he was murdered by enemies of Richard II or even on the orders of his successor Henry IV, but the case is entirely circumstantial. Chaucer was buried in Westminster Abbey in London, as was his right owing to his status as a tenant of the Abbey's close. In 1556, his remains were transferred to a more ornate tomb, making Chaucer the first writer interred in the area now known as Poets' Corner.\\r\\nChaucer was a close friend of John of Gaunt, the wealthy Duke of Lancaster (and father of the future King of England), and served under his patronage. Near the end of their lives Lancaster and Chaucer became brothers-in-law. Chaucer married Philippa (Pan) de Roet in 1366, and Lancaster took his mistress of nearly 30 years, Katherine Swynford (de Roet), who was Philippa Chaucer's sister, as his third wife in 1396. Although Philippa died c.1387, the men were bound as brothers and Lancaster's children by KatherineJohn, Henry, Thomas and Joan Beaufortwere Chaucer's nephews and niece.\\r\\nChaucer's Book of the Duchess, also known as the Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse,[23] was written in commemoration of Blanche of Lancaster, John of Gaunt's first wife. The poem refers to John and Blanche in allegory as the narrator relates the tale of \\"A long castel with walles white/Be Seynt Johan, on a ryche hil\\" (1318ÿ1319) who is mourning grievously after the death of his love, \\"And goode faire White she het/That was my lady name ryght\\" (948ÿ949). The phrase \\"long castel\\" is a reference to Lancaster (also called \\"Loncastel\\" and \\"Longcastell\\"), \\"walles white\\" is thought to likely be an oblique reference to Blanche, \\"Seynt Johan\\" was John of Gaunt's name-saint, and \\"ryche hil\\" is a reference to Richmond; these thinly veiled references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. \\"White\\" is the English translation of the French word \\"blanche\\", implying that the white lady was Blanche of Lancaster.[24]\\r\\nBelieved to have been written in the 1390s, Chaucer's short poem Fortune, is also inferred to directly reference Lancaster.[25][26] \\"Chaucer as narrator\\" openly defies Fortune, proclaiming he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit, and declares \\"my suffisaunce\\" (15) and that \\"over himself hath the maystrye\\" (14). Fortune, in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, \\"And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve\\" (32, 40, 48). Chaucer retorts that \\"My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse\\" (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. Fortune turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and \\"Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne\\" (78ÿ79). The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, and a portion of line 76, \\"as three of you or tweyne,\\" to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes.[25] Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's \\"beste frend\\". Fortune states three times in her response to the plaintiff, \\"And also, you still have your best friend alive\\" (32, 40, 48); she also references his \\"beste frend\\" in the envoy when appealing to his \\"noblesse\\" to help Chaucer to a higher estate. A fifth reference is made by \\"Chaucer as narrator\\" who rails at Fortune that she shall not take his friend from him. While the envoy playfully hints to Lancaster that Chaucer would certainly appreciate a boost to his status or income, the poem Fortune distinctively shows his deep appreciation and affection for John of Gaunt.\\r\\nChaucer's first major work, The Book of the Duchess, was an elegy for Blanche of Lancaster (who died in 1369). It is possible that this work was commissioned by her husband John of Gaunt, as he granted Chaucer a S10 annuity on 13 June 1374. This would seem to place the writing of The Book of the Duchess between the years 1369 and 1374. Two other early works by Chaucer were Anelida and Arcite and The House of Fame. Chaucer wrote many of his major works in a prolific period when he held the job of customs comptroller for London (1374 to 1386). His Parlement of Foules, The Legend of Good Women and Troilus and Criseyde all date from this time. It is believed that in the early 1380s he started the work for which he is best known ÿ The Canterbury Tales, a collection of stories told by fictional pilgrims on the road to the cathedral at Canterbury; tales that would help to shape English literature.\\r\\nThe Canterbury Tales contrasts with other literature of the period in the naturalism of its narrative, the variety of stories the pilgrims tell and the varied characters who are engaged in the pilgrimage. Many of the stories narrated by the pilgrims seem to fit their individual characters and social standing, although some of the stories seem ill-fitting to their narrators, perhaps as a result of the incomplete state of the work. Chaucer drew on real life for his cast of pilgrims: the innkeeper shares the name of a contemporary keeper of an inn in Southwark, and real-life identities for the Wife of Bath, the Merchant, the Man of Law and the Student have been suggested. The many jobs that Chaucer held in medieval societypage, soldier, messenger, valet, bureaucrat, foreman and administratorprobably exposed him to many of the types of people he depicted in the Tales. He was able to shape their speech and satirise their manners in what was to become popular literature among people of the same types.\\r\\nChaucer's works are sometimes grouped into first a French period, then an Italian period and finally an English period, with Chaucer being influenced by those countries' literatures in turn. Certainly Troilus and Criseyde is a middle period work with its reliance on the forms of Italian poetry, little known in England at the time, but to which Chaucer was probably exposed during his frequent trips abroad on court business. In addition, its use of a classical subject and its elaborate, courtly language sets it apart as one of his most complete and well-formed works. In Troilus and Criseyde Chaucer draws heavily on his source, Boccaccio, and on the late Latin philosopher Boethius. However, it is The Canterbury Tales, wherein he focuses on English subjects, with bawdy jokes and respected figures often being undercut with humour, that has cemented his reputation.\\r\\nChaucer also translated such important works as Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy and The Romance of the Rose by Guillaume de Lorris (extended by Jean de Meun). However, while many scholars maintain that Chaucer did indeed translate part of the text of Roman de la Rose as The Romaunt of the Rose, others claim that this has been effectively disproved. Many of his other works were very loose translations of, or simply based on, works from continental Europe. It is in this role that Chaucer receives some of his earliest critical praise. Eustache Deschamps wrote a ballade on the great translator and called himself a \\"nettle in Chaucer's garden of poetry\\". In 1385 Thomas Usk made glowing mention of Chaucer, and John Gower, Chaucer's main poetic rival of the time, also lauded him. This reference was later edited out of Gower's Confessio Amantis and it was suggested by one editor[27] that this was done because of ill feeling between them, but it is likely due simply to stylistic concerns.\\r\\nOne other significant work of Chaucer's is his Treatise on the Astrolabe, possibly for his own son, that describes the form and use of that instrument in detail and is sometimes cited as the first example of technical writing in the English language. Although much of the text may have come from other sources, the treatise indicates that Chaucer was versed in science in addition to his literary talents. Another scientific work discovered in 1952, Equatorie of the Planetis, has language and handwriting similar to some considered to be Chaucer's and it continues many of the ideas from the Astrolabe. Furthermore, it contains an example of early European encryption.[28] The attribution of this work to Chaucer is still uncertain.\\r\\nChaucer wrote in continental accentual-syllabic meter, a style which had developed since around the 12th century as an alternative to the alliterative Anglo-Saxon metre.[29] Chaucer is known for metrical innovation, inventing the rhyme royal, and he was one of the first English poets to use the five-stress line, a decasyllabic cousin to the iambic pentameter, in his work, with only a few anonymous short works using it before him.[30] The arrangement of these five-stress lines into rhyming couplets, first seen in his The Legend of Good Women, was used in much of his later work and became one of the standard poetic forms in English. His early influence as a satirist is also important, with the common humorous device, the funny accent of a regional dialect, apparently making its first appearance in The Reeve's Tale.\\r\\nThe poetry of Chaucer, along with other writers of the era, is credited with helping to standardise the London Dialect of the Middle English language from a combination of the Kentish and Midlands dialects.[31] This is probably overstated; the influence of the court, chancery and bureaucracyof which Chaucer was a partremains a more probable influence on the development of Standard English. Modern English is somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucer's poems owing to the effect of the Great Vowel Shift some time after his death. This change in the pronunciation of English, still not fully understood, makes the reading of Chaucer difficult for the modern audience. The status of the final -e in Chaucer's verse is uncertain: it seems likely that during the period of Chaucer's writing the final -e was dropping out of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular. Chaucer's versification suggests that the final -e is sometimes to be vocalised, and sometimes to be silent; however, this remains a point on which there is disagreement. When it is vocalised, most scholars pronounce it as a schwa. Apart from the irregular spelling, much of the vocabulary is recognisable to the modern reader. Chaucer is also recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary as the first author to use many common English words in his writings. These words were probably frequently used in the language at the time but Chaucer, with his ear for common speech, is the earliest extant manuscript source. Acceptable, alkali, altercation, amble, angrily, annex, annoyance, approaching, arbitration, armless, army, arrogant, arsenic, arc, artillery and aspect are just some of the many English words first attested in Chaucer.\\r\\nWidespread knowledge of Chaucer's works is attested by the many poets who imitated or responded to his writing. John Lydgate was one of the earliest poets to write continuations of Chaucer's unfinished Tales while Robert Henryson's Testament of Cresseid completes the story of Cressida left unfinished in his Troilus and Criseyde. Many of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works contain material from these poets and later appreciations by the romantic era poets were shaped by their failure to distinguish the later \\"additions\\" from original Chaucer. Writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as John Dryden, admired Chaucer for his stories, but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers, leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess.[32] It was not until the late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon, accepted today, was decided upon, largely as a result of Walter William Skeat's work. Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer's death, The Canterbury Tales was selected by William Caxton to be one of the first books to be printed in England.\\r\\nChaucer is sometimes considered the source of the English vernacular tradition. His achievement for the language can be seen as part of a general historical trend towards the creation of a vernacular literature, after the example of Dante, in many parts of Europe. A parallel trend in Chaucer's own lifetime was underway in Scotland through the work of his slightly earlier contemporary, John Barbour, and was likely to have been even more general, as is evidenced by the example of the Pearl Poet in the north of England.\\r\\nAlthough Chaucer's language is much closer to Modern English than the text of Beowulf, such that (unlike that of Beowulf) a Modern English-speaker with a large vocabulary of archaic words may understand it, it differs enough that most publications modernise his idiom. The following is a sample from the prologue of The Summoner's Tale that compares Chaucer's text to a modern translation:\\r\\nThe poet Thomas Hoccleve, who may have met Chaucer and considered him his role model, hailed Chaucer as \\"the firste fyndere of our fair langage.\\"[34] John Lydgate referred to Chaucer within his own text The Fall of Princes as the \\"lodesterre  off our language\\".[35] Around two centuries later, Sir Philip Sidney greatly praised Troilus and Criseyde in his own Defence of Poesie.[36]\\r\\nThe large number of surviving manuscripts of Chaucer's works is testimony to the enduring interest in his poetry prior to the arrival of the printing press. There are 83 surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales (in whole or part) alone, along with sixteen of Troilus and Criseyde, including the personal copy of Henry IV.[37] Given the ravages of time, it is likely that these surviving manuscripts represent hundreds since lost. Chaucer's original audience was a courtly one, and would have included women as well as men of the upper social classes. Yet even before his death in 1400, Chaucer's audience had begun to include members of the rising literate, middle and merchant classes, which included many Lollard sympathisers who may well have been inclined to read Chaucer as one of their own, particularly in his satirical writings about friars, priests, and other church officials. In 1464, John Baron, a tenant farmer in Agmondesham, was brought before John Chadworth, the Bishop of Lincoln, on charges he was a Lollard heretic; he confessed to owning a \\"boke of the Tales of Caunterburie\\" among other suspect volumes.[38]\\r\\nWilliam Caxton, the first English printer, was responsible for the first two folio editions of The Canterbury Tales which were published in 1478 and 1483.[39] Caxton's second printing, by his own account, came about because a customer complained that the printed text differed from a manuscript he knew; Caxton obligingly used the man's manuscript as his source. Both Caxton editions carry the equivalent of manuscript authority. Caxton's edition was reprinted by his successor, Wynkyn de Worde, but this edition has no independent authority.\\r\\nRichard Pynson, the King's Printer under Henry VIII for about twenty years, was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer, introducing in the process five previously printed texts that we now know are not Chaucer's. (The collection is actually three separately printed texts, or collections of texts, bound together as one volume.) There is a likely connection between Pynson's product and William Thynne's a mere six years later. Thynne had a successful career from the 1520s until his death in 1546, when he was one of the masters of the royal household. His editions of Chaucers Works in 1532 and 1542 were the first major contributions to the existence of a widely recognised Chaucerian canon. Thynne represents his edition as a book sponsored by and supportive of the king who is praised in the preface by Sir Brian Tuke. Thynne's canon brought the number of apocryphal works associated with Chaucer to a total of 28, even if that was not his intention. As with Pynson, once included in the Works, pseudepigraphic texts stayed within it, regardless of their first editor's intentions.\\r\\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, Chaucer was printed more than any other English author, and he was the first author to have his works collected in comprehensive single-volume editions in which a Chaucer canon began to cohere. Some scholars contend that 16th-century editions of Chaucer's Works set the precedent for all other English authors in terms of presentation, prestige and success in print. These editions certainly established Chaucer's reputation, but they also began the complicated process of reconstructing and frequently inventing Chaucer's biography and the canonical list of works which were attributed to him.\\r\\nProbably the most significant aspect of the growing apocrypha is that, beginning with Thynne's editions, it began to include medieval texts that made Chaucer appear as a proto-Protestant Lollard, primarily the Testament of Love and The Plowman's Tale. As \\"Chaucerian\\" works that were not considered apocryphal until the late 19th century, these medieval texts enjoyed a new life, with English Protestants carrying on the earlier Lollard project of appropriating existing texts and authors who seemed sympatheticor malleable enough to be construed as sympatheticto their cause. The official Chaucer of the early printed volumes of his Works was construed as a proto-Protestant as the same was done, concurrently, with William Langland and Piers Plowman. The famous Plowman's Tale did not enter Thynne's Works until the second, 1542, edition. Its entry was surely facilitated by Thynne's inclusion of Thomas Usk's Testament of Love in the first edition. The Testament of Love imitates, borrows from, and thus resembles Usk's contemporary, Chaucer. (Testament of Love also appears to borrow from Piers Plowman.) Since the Testament of Love mentions its author's part in a failed plot (book 1, chapter 6), his imprisonment, and (perhaps) a recantation of (possibly Lollard) heresy, all this was associated with Chaucer. (Usk himself was executed as a traitor in 1388.) Interestingly, John Foxe took this recantation of heresy as a defence of the true faith, calling Chaucer a \\"right Wiclevian\\" and (erroneously) identifying him as a schoolmate and close friend of John Wycliffe at Merton College, Oxford. (Thomas Speght is careful to highlight these facts in his editions and his \\"Life of Chaucer.\\") No other sources for the Testament of Love existthere is only Thynne's construction of whatever manuscript sources he had.\\r\\nJohn Stow (1525ÿ1605) was an antiquarian and also a chronicler. His edition of Chaucer's Works in 1561[40] brought the apocrypha to more than 50 titles. More were added in the 17th century, and they remained as late as 1810, well after Thomas Tyrwhitt pared the canon down in his 1775 edition.[41] The compilation and printing of Chaucer's works was, from its beginning, a political enterprise, since it was intended to establish an English national identity and history that grounded and authorised the Tudor monarchy and church. What was added to Chaucer often helped represent him favourably to Protestant England.\\r\\nIn his 1598 edition of the Works, Speght (probably taking cues from Foxe) made good use of Usk's account of his political intrigue and imprisonment in the Testament of Love to assemble a largely fictional \\"Life of Our Learned English Poet, Geffrey Chaucer.\\" Speght's \\"Life\\" presents readers with an erstwhile radical in troubled times much like their own, a proto-Protestant who eventually came around the king's views on religion. Speght states that \\"In the second year of Richard the second, the King tooke Geffrey Chaucer and his lands into his protection. The occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people.\\" Under the discussion of Chaucer's friends, namely John of Gaunt, Speght further explains:\\r\\nLater, in \\"The Argument\\" to the Testament of Love, Speght adds:\\r\\nSpeght is also the source of the famous tale of Chaucer being fined for beating a Franciscan friar in Fleet Street, as well as a fictitious coat of arms and family tree. Ironicallyand perhaps consciously soan introductory, apologetic letter in Speght's edition from Francis Beaumont defends the unseemly, \\"low\\", and bawdy bits in Chaucer from an elite, classicist position. Francis Thynne noted some of these inconsistencies in his Animadversions, insisting that Chaucer was not a commoner, and he objected to the friar-beating story. Yet Thynne himself underscores Chaucer's support for popular religious reform, associating Chaucer's views with his father William Thynne's attempts to include The Plowman's Tale and The Pilgrim's Tale in the 1532 and 1542 Works.\\r\\nThe myth of the Protestant Chaucer continues to have a lasting impact on a large body of Chaucerian scholarship. Though it is extremely rare for a modern scholar to suggest Chaucer supported a religious movement that didn't exist until more than a century after his death, the predominance of this thinking for so many centuries left it for granted that Chaucer was at least hostile toward Catholicism. This assumption forms a large part of many critical approaches to Chaucer's works, including neo-Marxism.\\r\\nAlongside Chaucer's Works, the most impressive literary monument of the period is John Foxe's Acts and Monuments.... As with the Chaucer editions, it was critically significant to English Protestant identity and included Chaucer in its project. Foxe's Chaucer both derived from and contributed to the printed editions of Chaucer's Works, particularly the pseudepigrapha. Jack Upland was first printed in Foxe's Acts and Monuments, and then it appeared in Speght's edition of Chaucer's Works. Speght's \\"Life of Chaucer\\" echoes Foxe's own account, which is itself dependent upon the earlier editions that added the Testament of Love and The Plowman's Tale to their pages. Like Speght's Chaucer, Foxe's Chaucer was also a shrewd (or lucky) political survivor. In his 1563 edition, Foxe \\"thought it not out of season  to couple  some mention of Geoffrey Chaucer\\" with a discussion of John Colet, a possible source for John Skelton's character Colin Clout.\\r\\nProbably referring to the 1542 Act for the Advancement of True Religion, Foxe said that he \\"marvel[s] to consider  how the bishops, condemning and abolishing all manner of English books and treatises which might bring the people to any light of knowledge, did yet authorise the works of Chaucer to remain still and to be occupied; who, no doubt, saw into religion as much almost as even we do now, and uttereth in his works no less, and seemeth to be a right Wicklevian, or else there never was any. And that, all his works almost, if they be thoroughly advised, will testify (albeit done in mirth, and covertly); and especially the latter end of his third book of the Testament of Love  Wherein, except a man be altogether blind, he may espy him at the full: although in the same book (as in all others he useth to do), under shadows covertly, as under a visor, he suborneth truth in such sort, as both privily she may profit the godly-minded, and yet not be espied of the crafty adversary. And therefore the bishops, belike, taking his works but for jests and toys, in condemning other books, yet permitted his books to be read.\\"\\r\\nIt is significant, too, that Foxe's discussion of Chaucer leads into his history of \\"The Reformation of the Church of Christ in the Time of Martin Luther\\" when \\"Printing, being opened, incontinently ministered unto the church the instruments and tools of learning and knowledge; which were good books and authors, which before lay hid and unknown. The science of printing being found, immediately followed the grace of God; which stirred up good wits aptly to conceive the light of knowledge and judgment: by which light darkness began to be espied, and ignorance to be detected; truth from error, religion from superstition, to be discerned.\\"\\r\\nFoxe downplays Chaucer's bawdy and amorous writing, insisting that it all testifies to his piety. Material that is troubling is deemed metaphoric, while the more forthright satire (which Foxe prefers) is taken literally.\\r\\nJohn Urry produced the first edition of the complete works of Chaucer in a Latin font, published posthumously in 1721. Included were several tales, according to the editors, for the first time printed, a biography of Chaucer, a glossary of old English words, and testimonials of author writers concerning Chaucer dating back to the 16th century. According to A. S. G Edwards, \\"This was the first collected edition of Chaucer to be printed in roman type. The life of Chaucer prefixed to the volume was the work of the Reverend John Dart, corrected and revised by Timothy Thomas. The glossary appended was also mainly compiled by Thomas. The text of Urry's edition has often been criticised by subsequent editors for its frequent conjectural emendations, mainly to make it conform to his sense of Chaucer's metre. The justice of such criticisms should not obscure his achievement. His is the first edition of Chaucer for nearly a hundred and fifty years to consult any manuscripts and is the first since that of William Thynne in 1534 to seek systematically to assemble a substantial number of manuscripts to establish his text. It is also the first edition to offer descriptions of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works, and the first to print texts of 'Gamelyn' and 'The Tale of Beryn', works ascribed to, but not by, Chaucer.\\"\\r\\nAlthough Chaucer's works had long been admired, serious scholarly work on his legacy did not begin until the late 18th century, when Thomas Tyrwhitt edited The Canterbury Tales, and it did not become an established academic discipline until the 19th century.[42] Scholars such as Frederick James Furnivall, who founded the Chaucer Society in 1868, pioneered the establishment of diplomatic editions of Chaucer's major texts, along with careful accounts of Chaucer's language and prosody. Walter William Skeat, who like Furnivall was closely associated with the Oxford English Dictionary, established the base text of all of Chaucer's works with his edition, published by Oxford University Press. Later editions by John H. Fisher and Larry D. Benson offered further refinements, along with critical commentary and bibliographies.\\r\\nWith the textual issues largely addressed, if not resolved, attention turned to the questions of Chaucer's themes, structure, and audience. The Chaucer Review was founded in 1966 and has maintained its position as the pre-eminent journal of Chaucer studies.\\r\\nThe following major works are in rough chronological order but scholars still debate the dating of most of Chaucer's output and works made up from a collection of stories may have been compiled over a long period.","input":"Who is the father of the english language?"},{"output":"Ancient Carthage","context":"The First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) was the first of three wars fought between Ancient Carthage and the Roman Republic, the two great powers of the Western Mediterranean. For 23 years, in the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of ancient times, the two powers struggled for supremacy, primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa.\\r\\nThe war began in 264 BC with the Roman conquest of the Carthaginian-controlled city of Messina in Sicily, granting Rome a military foothold on the island. The Romans built up a navy to challenge Carthage, the greatest naval power in the Mediterranean, for control over the waters around Sicily. In naval battles and storms, 700 Roman and 500 Carthaginian quinqueremes were lost, along with hundreds of thousands of lives. Command of the sea was won and lost by both sides repeatedly. A Roman invasion of Carthaginian Africa was destroyed in battle and the Roman consul Marcus Atilius Regulus was captured by the Carthaginians in 255. In 23 years, the Romans slowly conquered Sicily and drove the Carthaginians to the west end of the island.\\r\\nAfter both sides had been brought to a state of near exhaustion, the Romans mobilized their citizenry's private wealth and created a new fleet under consul Gaius Lutatius Catulus. The Carthaginian fleet was destroyed at the Aegates Islands in 241, forcing the cut-off Carthaginian troops on Sicily to give up. A peace treaty was signed in which Carthage was made to pay a heavy indemnity and Rome ejected Carthage from Sicily, annexing the island as a Roman province.\\r\\nThe war was followed by a failed revolt against the Carthaginian Empire. The Romans exploited Carthage's weakness to seize the Carthaginian possessions of Sardinia and Corsica in violation of the peace treaty. The unresolved strategic competition between Rome and Carthage would lead to the eruption of the Second Punic War in 218 BC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series of wars between Rome and Carthage took the name \\"Punic\\" from the Latin adjective for Carthaginian, Punicus. This is derived from Poeni (Carthaginians) and refers to the Carthaginian heritage as Phoenician colonists.[1] A Carthaginian name(s) for the conflicts does not survive in any records.[citation needed]\\r\\nRome had recently emerged as the leading city-state in the Italian Peninsula, a wealthy, powerful, expansionist republic with a successful citizen army.[2] Over the past one hundred years, Rome had come into conflict, and defeated rivals on the Italian peninsula, then incorporated them into the Roman political world. First the Latin League was forcibly dissolved during the Latin War,[3] then the power of the Samnites was broken during the three prolonged Samnite wars,[4] and then the Greek cities of Magna Graecia (southern Italy) submitted to Roman power at the conclusion of the Pyrrhic War.[4] By the beginning of the First Punic War, the Romans had secured the whole of the Italian peninsula, except Gallia Cisalpina in the Po Valley.\\r\\nCarthage was a republic that dominated the political, military and economic affairs of the western Mediterranean Sea, especially on the North African coasts and islands, and above all, due to its navy.[2][5] It originated as a Phoenician colony in Africa, near modern Tunis. Carthage had become a wealthy centre for trade networks extending from Gadir (Cdiz) along the coasts of southern Iberia and North Africa, across the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sardinia, and the western half of Sicily, to the ports of the eastern Mediterranean, including Tyre, its mother city, on the shores of the Levant.[6] At the height of power, just before the First Punic War, Carthage was hostile to foreign ships (such as Roman and Greek vessels) in the western Mediterranean.[7]\\r\\nNorth African peoples such as the Berbers in the area around Carthage were loosely associated with Carthage.[8] In the midst of the First Punic War some tribes would rebel against Carthage, opening a second front while the Carthaginians battled the Romans in Sicily.\\r\\nGreek colonists were also a major presence in the western Mediterranean, following centuries of colonial settlement, trade and conflicts with Rome over Magna Graecia and with Carthage over places such as Sicily.[9][10] The rich, strategically influential, and well-fortified Greek colony of Syracuse was politically independent of Rome and Carthage. Hostilities of the First Punic War began with developments involving the Romans, Carthaginians, and Greek colonists in Sicily and southern Italy.\\r\\nIn 288 BC, the Mamertines, a group of Italian (Campanian) mercenaries originally hired by Agathocles of Syracuse, occupied the city of Messana (modern Messina) in the north-eastern tip of Sicily, killing all the men and taking the women as their wives.[11] At the same time, a group of Roman troops made up of Campanian \\"citizens without the vote\\" revolted and seized control of Rhegium, lying across the Straits of Messina on the mainland of Italy. In 270 BC, the Romans regained control of Rhegium and severely punished the survivors of the revolt. In Sicily, the Mamertines ravaged the countryside and collided with the expanding regional empire of the independent city of Syracuse. Hiero II, tyrant of Syracuse, defeated the Mamertines near Mylae on the Longanus River.[12] Following their defeat, the Mamertines appealed to both Rome and Carthage for assistance. The Carthaginians acted first, approached Hiero to take no further action and convinced the Mamertines to accept a Carthaginian garrison in Messana. Either unhappy with the prospect of a Carthaginian garrison or convinced that the recent alliance between Rome and Carthage against Pyrrhus reflected cordial relations between the two, the Mamertines, hoping for more reliable protection, petitioned Rome for an alliance. However, the rivalry between Rome and Carthage had grown since the war with Pyrrhus and that alliance was simply no longer feasible.[13]\\r\\nAccording to the historian Polybius, considerable debate took place in Rome on the question as to whether to accept the Mamertines' appeal for help and thus likely enter into a war with Carthage. The Romans did not wish to come to the aid of soldiers who had unjustly stolen a city from its rightful possessors, and they were still recovering from the insurrection of Campanian troops at the Battle of Rhegium in 271 BC. However, many were also unwilling to see Carthaginian power in Sicily expand even further. Leaving them at Messana would give the Carthaginians a free hand to deal with Syracuse. After the Syracusans had been defeated, the Carthaginian takeover of Sicily would essentially be complete.[14] A deadlocked senate put the matter before the popular assembly, where it was decided to accept the Mamertines' request and Appius Claudius Caudex was appointed commander of a military expedition with orders to cross to Messana.[15][16]\\r\\nSicily is a hilly volcanic island, with geographical obstacles and rough terrain making lines of communication difficult to maintain. For this reason, land warfare played a secondary role in the First Punic War.[citation needed] Land operations were confined to small scale raids and skirmishes, with few pitched battles. Sieges and land blockades were the most common large-scale operations for the regular army. The main blockade targets were the important ports since neither Carthage nor Rome were based in Sicily, and both needed continuous reinforcements and communication with their mainlands.[17]\\r\\nThe land war in Sicily began with the Roman landing at Messana in 264 BC. According to Polybius, despite the Carthaginian pre-war naval advantage, the Roman landing was virtually unopposed. Two legions commanded by Appius Claudius Caudex disembarked at Messana, where the Mamertines had expelled the Carthaginian garrison commanded by Hanno (no relation to Hanno the Great).[18] After defeating the Syracusan and Carthaginian forces besieging Messana, the Romans marched south and in turn besieged Syracuse.[19] After a brief siege, with no Carthaginian help in sight, Syracuse made peace with the Romans.[20]\\r\\nAccording to the terms of the treaty, Syracuse would become a Roman ally, pay a somewhat light indemnity of 100 talents of silver to Rome and, perhaps most importantly, agree to help supply the Roman army in Sicily.[20] That solved the Roman problem of having to keep an overseas army provisioned while facing an enemy with a superior navy.[20][21] Following the defection of Syracuse from Carthage, several other smaller Carthaginian dependencies in Sicily also switched to the Roman side.[20]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Carthage had begun to build a mercenary army in Africa, which was to be shipped to Sicily to meet the Romans. According to the historian Philinus, this army was composed of 50,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry, and 60 elephants and partly composed of Ligurians, Celts and Iberians.[22][23]\\r\\nIn past wars on the island of Sicily, Carthage had won by relying on certain fortified strong-points throughout the island, and their plan was to conduct the land war in the same fashion. The mercenary army would operate in the open against the Romans, while the strongly fortified cities would provide a defensive base from which to operate.[20]\\r\\nIn 262 BC, Rome besieged Agrigentum, an operation that involved both consular armiesa total of four Roman legionsand took several months to resolve. The garrison of Agrigentum (known to the Greeks as Acragas) managed to call for reinforcements and the Carthaginian relief force commanded by Hanno which destroyed the Roman supply base at Erbessus.[24] With supplies from Syracuse cut, the Romans were now besieged and constructed a line of contravallation.[24] After a few skirmishes, disease struck the Roman army while supplies in Agrigentum were running low, and both sides saw an open battle as preferable to the current situation.[24] Although the Romans won a clear victory over the Carthaginian relief force at the Battle of Agrigentum, the Carthaginian army defending the city managed to escape.[24] Agrigentum, now lacking any real defences, fell easily to the Romans, who then sacked the city and enslaved the populace.[24][25]\\r\\nAt the beginning of the First Punic War, Rome had virtually no experience in naval warfare, whereas the strong and powerful Carthage had a great deal of experience on the seas thanks to its centuries of sea-based trade. Nevertheless, the growing Roman Republic soon understood the importance of Mediterranean control in the outcome of the conflict.[26]\\r\\nThe first major Roman fleet was constructed after the victory of Agrigentum in 261 BC. Some historians have speculated that, since Rome lacked advanced naval technology, the design of the warships was probably copied from captured Carthaginian triremes and quinqueremes or from ships that had beached on Roman shores due to storms.[27] According to Polybius, the Romans seized a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme, and used it as a blueprint for their own ships.[28] Other historians have pointed out that Rome did have experience with naval technology, as she patrolled her coasts against piracy.[29] Another possibility is that Rome received technical assistance from its seafaring Sicilian ally, Syracuse.[29] Regardless of the state of their naval technology at the start of the war, Rome quickly adapted.[30]\\r\\nIn order to compensate for the lack of experience, and to make use of standard land military tactics at sea,[31] the Romans equipped their new ships with a special boarding device, the corvus.[32] The Roman military was a land-based army, while Carthage was primarily a naval power. This boarding-bridge allowed the Roman navy to circumvent some of Carthage's naval skills by using their marines to board Carthaginian ships and fight in hand-to-hand combat. Instead of manoeuvring to ram, which was the standard naval tactic at the time, corvus equipped ships would manoeuver alongside the enemy vessel, deploy the bridge which would attach to the enemy ship through spikes on the end of the bridge, and send legionaries across as boarding parties.[33][34]\\r\\nThe new weapon would prove its worth in the Battle of Mylae, the first Roman naval victory, and would continue to do so in the following years, especially in the huge Battle of Cape Ecnomus. The addition of the corvus forced Carthage to review its military tactics, and since the city had difficulty in doing so, Rome had the naval advantage.[35]\\r\\nThe Roman fleet under the command of Gaius Duilius, engaged the Carthaginians under general Hannibal Gisco, off northern Mylae in 260 BC. Polybius states that the Carthaginians had 130 ships, but does not give an exact figure for the Romans.[36] The loss of 17 ships at the Lipari Islands from a starting total of 120 ships suggests that Rome had 103 remaining. However, it is possible that this number was greater, thanks to captured ships and the assistance of Roman allies.[37] The Carthaginians anticipated victory, due to their superior experience at sea.[36]\\r\\nThe corvi were very successful, and helped the Romans seize the first 30 Carthaginian ships that were close enough. In order to avoid the corvi, the Carthaginians were forced to navigate around them and approach the Romans from behind, or from the side. The corvus was usually still able to pivot and grapple most oncoming ships.[38] After an additional 20 Carthaginian ships had been hooked and lost to the Romans, Hannibal Gisco retreated with his surviving ships, leaving Duilius with a clear victory.\\r\\nInstead of pursuing the remaining Carthaginians, Duilius sailed to Sicily to relieve the city of Segesta, which had been under siege from the Carthaginian infantry commander Hamilcar.[39] Modern historians have wondered at Duilius decision not to immediately follow up with another naval attack, but Hannibal Giscos remaining 80 ships were probably still too strong for Rome to conquer.[40]\\r\\nThe Roman advance now continued westward from Agrigentum to relieve the besieged city of Macella in 260 BC,[41] which had sided with Rome and was attacked by the Carthaginians for doing so. In the north, the Romans, with their northern sea flank secured by their naval victory at the Battle of Mylae, advanced toward Thermae. They were defeated there by the Carthaginians under Hamilcar (a popular Carthaginian name, not to be confused with Hannibal Barca's father, with the same name) in 260 BC.[42] The Carthaginians took advantage of this victory by counter-attacking, in 259 BC, and seizing Enna. Hamilcar continued south to Camarina, in Syracusan territory, presumably with the intent to convince the Syracusans to rejoin the Carthaginian side.[43]\\r\\nThe next year, 258 BC, the Romans were able to regain the initiative by retaking Enna and Camarina. In central Sicily, they took the town of Mytistraton, which they had attacked twice previously. The Romans also moved in the north by marching across the northern coast toward Panormus, but were not able to take the city.[44]\\r\\nAfter their conquests in the Agrigentum campaign, and following several naval battles, Rome attempted (256/255 BC) the second large scale land operation of the war. Seeking a swifter end to the war than the long sieges in Sicily would have provided, Rome decided to invade the Carthaginian colonies of Africa and usurp Carthage's supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea, consequently forcing Carthage to accept its terms.[33][45]\\r\\nIn order to initiate its invasion of Africa, the Roman Republic constructed a major fleet, comprising transports for the army and its equipment, and warships for protection. Carthage attempted to intervene with a fleet of 350 ships (according to Polybius),[46] but was defeated in the Battle of Cape Ecnomus.[47]\\r\\nAs a result of the battle, the Roman army, commanded by Marcus Atilius Regulus, landed in Africa and began ravaging the Carthaginian countryside.[48] The Siege of Aspis (or Clupea) was the first fighting on African land during the war. Regulus was next victorious at the Battle of Adys, forcing Carthage to sue for peace.[49] According to Polybius, the terms suggested were so heavy that Carthage decided they would be better off not under Roman rule. The negotiations failed but fortunately, for the Carthaginians, Xanthippus, a Spartan mercenary, returned to Carthage to reorganise its army.[33][50] Xanthippus defeated the Roman army and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis,[51][52] and then managed to cut off what remained of the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy.[53][54]\\r\\nThe Romans, meanwhile, had sent a new fleet to pick up the survivors of its African expedition. Although the Romans defeated the Carthaginian fleet and were successful in rescuing their army in Africa, a storm destroyed nearly the entire Roman fleet on the return trip; the number of casualties in the disaster may have exceeded 90,000 men.[54] The Carthaginians took advantage of this to attack Agrigentum. They did not believe that they could hold the city, so they burned it and left.[55]\\r\\nThe Romans were able to rally, however, and quickly resumed the offensive. With a new fleet of 140 ships, Rome returned to the strategy of taking the Carthaginian cities in Sicily one by one.[56]\\r\\nAttacks began with naval assaults on Lilybaeum, the centre of Carthaginian power on Sicily, and a raid on Africa. Both efforts ended in failure.[57] The Romans retreated from Lilybaeum, and the Roman African force was caught in another storm and destroyed.[57]\\r\\nThe Romans, however, made great progress in the north. The city of Thermae was captured in 252 BC, enabling another advance on the port city of Panormus. The Romans attacked this city after taking Kephalodon in 251 BC. After fierce fighting, the Carthaginians were defeated and the city fell. With Panormus captured, much of western inland Sicily fell with it. The cities of Ietas, Solous, Petra, and Tyndaris agreed to peace with the Romans that same year.[58]\\r\\nThe next year, the Romans shifted their attention to the north-west. They sent a naval expedition toward Lilybaeum. En route, the Romans seized and burned the Carthaginian hold-out cities of Selinous and Heraclea Minoa. This expedition to Lilybaeum was not successful, but attacking the Carthaginian headquarters demonstrated Roman resolve to take all of Sicily.[59] The Roman fleet was defeated by the Carthaginians at Drepana, forcing the Romans to continue their attacks from land. Roman forces at Lilybaeum were relieved, and Eryx, near Drepana, was seized thus menacing that important city as well.[60]\\r\\nFollowing the conclusive naval victory off Drepana in 249 BC, Carthage ruled the seas as Rome was unwilling to finance the construction of yet another expensive fleet. Nevertheless, the Carthaginian faction that opposed the conflict, led by the land-owning aristocrat Hanno the Great, gained power and in 244 BC, considering the war to be over, started the demobilisation of the fleet, giving the Romans a chance to again attain naval superiority.[61]\\r\\nAt this point (247 BC[62]), Carthage sent general Hamilcar Barca (Hannibal's father) to Sicily. His landing at Heirkte (near Panormus) drew the Romans away to defend that port city and resupply point and gave Drepana some breathing room. Subsequent guerrilla warfare kept the Roman legions pinned down and preserved Carthage's toehold in Sicily, although Roman forces which bypassed Hamilcar forced him to relocate to Eryx, to better defend Drepana.[59]\\r\\nPerhaps in response to Hamilcar's raids, Rome built another fleet (paid for with donations from wealthy citizens). It was this fleet that rendered the Carthaginian success in Sicily futile, as the stalemate Hamilcar produced in Sicily became irrelevant following the Roman naval victory at the Battle of the Aegates Islands in 241 BC, where the new Roman fleet under consul Gaius Lutatius Catulus was victorious over an undermanned and hastily built Carthaginian fleet. Carthage lost most of its fleet and was economically incapable of funding another, or of finding manpower for the crews.[63]\\r\\nWithout naval support, Hamilcar Barca was cut off from Carthage and forced to negotiate peace and agree to evacuate Sicily.[64] It should be noted that Hamilcar Barca had a subordinate named Gesco conduct the negotiations with Lutatius, in order to create the impression that he had not really been defeated.[1][65]\\r\\nDue to the difficulty of operating in Sicily, most of the First Punic War was fought at sea, including the most decisive battles.[17] But one reason the war bogged down into stalemate on the landward side was because ancient navies were ineffective at maintaining seaward blockades of enemy ports. Consequently, Carthage was able to reinforce and re-supply its besieged strongholds, especially Lilybaeum, on the western end of Sicily. Both sides of the conflict had publicly funded fleets. This fact compromised Carthage and Rome's finances and eventually decided the course of the war.[66]\\r\\nDespite the Roman victories at sea, the Roman Republic lost countless ships and crews during the war, due to both storms and battles. On at least two occasions (255 and 253 BC) whole fleets were destroyed in bad weather; the disaster off Camarina in 255 BC counted two hundred seventy ships and over one hundred thousand men lost, the greatest single loss in history.[67] One theory is that the weight of the corvus on the prows of the ships made the ships unstable and caused them to sink in bad weather. Later, as Roman experience in naval warfare grew, the corvus device was made attachable and detachable due to its impact on the navigability of the war vessels.[68]\\r\\nRome won the First Punic War after 23 years of conflict and in the end became the dominant naval power of the Mediterranean. In the aftermath of the war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.[66] Corsica, Sardinia and Africa remained Carthaginian, but they had to pay a high war indemnity. Rome's victory was greatly influenced by its persistence. Moreover, the Roman Republic's ability to attract private investments in the war effort to fund ships and crews was one of the deciding factors of the war, particularly when contrasted with the Carthaginian nobility's apparent unwillingness to risk their fortunes for the common war effort.\\r\\nThe exact number of casualties on each side is difficult to determine, due to bias in the historical sources.\\r\\nAccording to sources (excluding land warfare casualties):[69]\\r\\nAlthough uncertain, the casualties were heavy for both sides. Polybius commented that the war was, at the time, the most destructive in terms of casualties in the history of warfare, including the battles of Alexander the Great. Analysing the data from the Roman census of the 3rd century BC, Adrian Goldsworthy noted that during the conflict Rome lost about 50,000 men. This excludes auxiliary troops and every other man in the army without citizen status, who would be outside the head count.[70][71]\\r\\nThe terms of the Treaty of Lutatius designed by the Romans were particularly heavy for Carthage, which had lost bargaining power following its defeat at the Aegates islands. Accordingly, Carthage agreed to:\\r\\nFurther clauses determined that the allies of each side would not be attacked by the other, no attacks were to be made by either side upon the other's allies and both sides were prohibited from recruiting soldiers within the territory of the other. This denied the Carthaginians access to any mercenary manpower from Italy and most of Sicily, although this later clause was temporarily abolished during the Mercenary War.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the war, Carthage had insufficient state funds. Hanno the Great tried to induce the disbanded armies to accept diminished payment, but kindled a movement that led to an internal conflict, the Mercenary War. After a hard struggle from the combined efforts of Hamilcar Barca, Hanno the Great and others, the Punic forces were finally able to annihilate the mercenaries and the insurgents. However, during this conflict, Rome took advantage of the opportunity to strip Carthage of Corsica and Sardinia as well.[1]\\r\\nPerhaps the most immediate political result of the First Punic War was the downfall of Carthage's naval power. Conditions signed in the peace treaty were intended to compromise Carthage's economic situation and prevent the city's recovery. The indemnity demanded by the Romans strained the city's finances and forced Carthage to look to other areas of influence for the money to pay Rome.[73]\\r\\nCarthage, seeking to make up for the recent territorial losses and a plentiful source of silver to pay the large indemnity owed to Rome, turned its attention to Iberia; and in 237 BC, the Carthaginians, led by Hamilcar Barca, began a series of campaigns to expand their control over the peninsula. Though Hamilcar was killed in 229 BC, the offensive continued with the Carthaginians extending their power towards the Ebro valley and founding \\"New Carthage\\" in 228 BC. When Carthage besieged the Roman protected town of Saguntum in 218 BC, it ignited the Second Punic War with Rome.[74]\\r\\nAs for Rome, the end of the First Punic War marked the start of Rome's expansion beyond the Italian Peninsula. Sicily became the first Roman province (Sicilia) governed by a former praetor, instead of an ally. Sicily would become very important to Rome as a source of grain.[1] Importantly, Syracuse was granted nominal independent ally status for the lifetime of Hiero II, and was not incorporated into the Roman province of Sicily until after it was sacked by Marcus Claudius Marcellus during the Second Punic War.[75]","input":"Who were the participants of the punic wars?"},{"output":"a collective defence treaty signed in Warsaw, Poland among the Soviet Union and seven Soviet satellite states of Central and Eastern Europe","context":"The Warsaw Pact, formally known as the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance,[1] was a collective defence treaty signed in Warsaw, Poland among the Soviet Union and seven Soviet satellite states of Central and Eastern Europe during the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO[2][3][4][5] in 1955 per the London and Paris Conferences of 1954,[6][7][8][9][10] but it is also considered to have been motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe.[11]\\r\\nThe Warsaw Pact was established as a balance of power[12] or counterweight[13] to NATO; there was no direct confrontation between them. Instead, the conflict was fought on an ideological basis and in proxy wars. Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact led to the expansion of military forces and their integration into the respective blocs.[13] Its largest military engagement was the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 (with the participation of all Pact nations except Albania, Romania and East Germany),[12] which, in part, resulted in Albania withdrawing from the pact less than a month later. The Pact began to unravel in its entirety with the spread of the Revolutions of 1989 through the Eastern Bloc, beginning with the Solidarity movement in Poland[14] and its electoral success in June 1989.\\r\\nEast Germany withdrew from the Pact in 1990. On 25 February 1991, the Pact was declared at an end at a meeting of defence and foreign ministers from the six remaining member states in Hungary. The USSR itself was dissolved in December 1991, although most of the former Soviet republics formed the Collective Security Treaty Organization shortly thereafter. Throughout the following 20 years, the seven Warsaw Pact countries outside the USSR each joined NATO (East Germany through its reunification with West Germany; and the Czech Republic and Slovakia as separate countries).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Western Bloc, the Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance is often called the Warsaw Pact military allianceabbreviated WAPA, Warpac and WP. Elsewhere, in the former member states, the Warsaw Treaty is known as:\\r\\nThe Warsaw Treaty's organization was two-fold: the Political Consultative Committee handled political matters, and the Combined Command of Pact Armed Forces controlled the assigned multi-national forces, with headquarters in Warsaw, Poland. Furthermore, the Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization which commanded and controlled all the military forces of the member countries was also a First Deputy Minister of Defence of the USSR, and the Chief of Combined Staff of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization was also a First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR. Therefore, although ostensibly an international collective security alliance, the USSR dominated the Warsaw Treaty armed forces.[15]\\r\\nThe strategy behind the formation of the Warsaw Pact was driven by the desire of the Soviet Union to dominate Central and Eastern Europe. The Soviets wanted to keep their part of Europe theirs and not let the Americans take it from them. This policy was driven by ideological and geostrategic reasons. Ideologically, the Soviet Union arrogated the right to define socialism and communism and act as the leader of the global socialist movement. A corollary to this idea was the necessity of intervention if a country appeared to be violating core socialist ideas and Communist Party functions, which was explicitly stated in the Brezhnev Doctrine.[16] Geostrategic principles also drove the Soviet Union with the desire to create a buffer zone to prevent invasion of its territory by Western European powers.\\r\\nBefore the creation of the Warsaw Pact, Czechoslovak leadership, fearful of a rearmed Germany, sought to create a security pact with East Germany and Poland.[9] These states protested strongly against the re-militarization of West Germany.[17] The Warsaw Pact was primarily put in place as a consequence of the rearming of West Germany inside NATO. Soviet leaders, like many European countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain, feared Germany being once again a military power and a direct threat. The terrible consequences of German militarism remained a fresh memory among the Soviets and Eastern Europeans.[3][4][18][19][20] As the Soviet Union already had bilateral treaties with all of its eastern satellites, the Pact has been long considered 'superfluous',[21] and because of the rushed way in which it was conceived, NATO officials labeled it as a 'cardboard castle'.[22] Previously, in March 1954, the USSR, fearing the restoration of German militarism in West Germany, requested admission to NATO.[23][24][25]\\r\\nThe Soviet request to join NATO arose in the aftermath of the Berlin Conference of JanuaryÿFebruary 1954. Soviet foreign minister Molotov made proposals to have Germany reunified[26] and elections for a pan-German government,[27] under conditions of withdrawal of the four powers' armies and German neutrality,[28] but all were refused by the other foreign ministers, Dulles (USA), Eden (UK) and Bidault (France).[29] Proposals for the reunification of Germany were nothing new: earlier on 20 March 1952, talks about a German reunification, initiated by the so-called 'Stalin Note', ended after the United Kingdom, France and the United States insisted that a unified Germany should not be neutral and should be free to join the European Defence Community and rearm. James Dunn (USA), who met in Paris with Eden, Adenauer and Robert Schuman (France), affirmed that \\"the object should be to avoid discussion with the Russians and to press on the European Defense Community\\".[30] According to John Gaddis \\"there was little inclination in Western capitals to explore this offer\\" from USSR.[31] While historian Rolf Steininger asserts that Adenauer's conviction that \\"neutralization means sovietization\\" was the main factor in the rejection of the Soviet proposals,[32] Adenauer also feared that German unification might have resulted in the end of the CDU's dominance in the West German Bundestag.[33]\\r\\nConsequently, Molotov, fearing that the EDC would be directed in the future against the USSR and \\"seeking to prevent the formation of groups of European States directed against other European States\\",[34] made a proposal for a General European Treaty on Collective Security in Europe \\"open to all European States without regard as to their social systems\\"[34] which would have included the unified Germany (thus making the EDC ÿ perceived by the USSR as a threat ÿ unusable). But Eden, Dulles and Bidault opposed the proposal.[35]\\r\\nOne month later, the proposed European Treaty was rejected not only by supporters of the EDC but also by Western opponents of the European Defence Community (like French Gaullist leader Palewski) who perceived it as \\"unacceptable in its present form because it excludes the USA from participation in the collective security system in Europe\\".[36] The Soviets then decided to make a new proposal to the governments of the USA, UK and France to accept the participation of the USA in the proposed General European Agreement.[36] And considering that another argument deployed against the Soviet proposal was that it was perceived by Western powers as \\"directed against the North Atlantic Pact and its liquidation\\",[36][37] the Soviets decided to declare their \\"readiness to examine jointly with other interested parties the question of the participation of the USSR in the North Atlantic bloc\\", specifying that \\"the admittance of the USA into the General European Agreement should not be conditional on the three Western powers agreeing to the USSR joining the North Atlantic Pact\\".[36]\\r\\nAgain all proposals, including the request to join NATO, were rejected by the UK, US and French governments shortly after.[25][38] Emblematic was the position of British General Hastings Ismay, supporter of NATO expansion, who said that NATO \\"must grow until the whole free world gets under one umbrella.\\"[39][incomplete short citation] He opposed the request to join NATO made by the USSR in 1954[40] saying that \\"the Soviet request to join NATO is like an unrepentant burglar requesting to join the police force\\".[41]\\r\\nIn April 1954 Adenauer made his first visit to the USA meeting Nixon, Eisenhower and Dulles. Ratification of EDC was delaying but the US representatives made it clear to Adenauer that EDC would have to become a part of NATO.[42]\\r\\nMemories of the Nazi occupation were still strong, and the rearmament of Germany was feared by France too.[4][43] On 30 August 1954 French Parliament rejected the EDC, thus ensuring its failure[44] and blocking a major objective of US policy towards Europe: to associate Germany militarily with the West.[45] The US Department of State started to elaborate alternatives: Germany would be invited to join NATO or, in the case of French obstructionism, strategies to circumvent a French veto would be implemented in order to obtain a German rearmament outside NATO.[46]\\r\\nOn 23 October 1954 ÿ only nine years after Allies (UK, USA and USSR) defeated Nazi Germany ending World War II in Europe ÿ the admission of the Federal Republic of Germany to the North Atlantic Pact was finally decided. The incorporation of West Germany into the organization on 9 May 1955 was described as \\"a decisive turning point in the history of our continent\\" by Halvard Lange, Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway at the time.[47] In November 1954, the USSR requested a new European Security Treaty,[48] in order to make a final attempt to not have a remilitarized West Germany potentially opposed to the Soviet Union, with no success.\\r\\nOn 14 May 1955, the USSR and other seven European countries \\"reaffirming their desire for the establishment of a system of European collective security based on the participation of all European states irrespective of their social and political systems\\"[49] established the Warsaw Pact in response to the integration of the Federal Republic of Germany into NATO,[3][5] declaring that: \\"a remilitarized Western Germany and the integration of the latter in the North-Atlantic bloc [...] increase the danger of another war and constitutes a threat to the national security of the peaceable states; [...] in these circumstances the peaceable European states must take the necessary measures to safeguard their security\\".[49]\\r\\nOne of the founding members, East Germany was allowed to re-arm by the Soviet Union and the National People's Army was established as the armed forces of the country to counter the rearmament of West Germany.\\r\\nThe eight member countries of the Warsaw Pact pledged the mutual defence of any member who would be attacked. Relations among the treaty signatories were based upon mutual non-intervention in the internal affairs of the member countries, respect for national sovereignty, and political independence. However, almost all governments of those member states were indirectly controlled by the Soviet Union.\\r\\nThe founding signatories to the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance consisted of the following communist governments:\\r\\n?Mongolia: In July 1963 the Mongolian People's Republic asked to join the Warsaw Pact under Article 9 of the treaty. Due to the emerging Sino-Soviet split, Mongolia remained on observer status. The Soviet Government agreed to station troops in Mongolia in 1966.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor 36 years, NATO and the Warsaw Pact never directly waged war against each other in Europe; the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies implemented strategic policies aimed at the containment of each other in Europe, while working and fighting for influence within the wider Cold War on the international stage. These included the Korean War, Vietnam War, Bay of Pigs invasion, Dirty War, CambodianÿVietnamese War and the others.\\r\\nIn 1956, following the declaration of the Imre Nagy government of withdrawal of Hungary from the Warsaw Pact, Soviet troops entered the country and removed the government. Soviet forces crushed the nationwide revolt, leading to the death of an estimated 2,500 Hungarian citizens.\\r\\nThe multi-national Communist armed forces' sole joint action was the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. All member countries, with the exception of the Socialist Republic of Romania and the People's Republic of Albania, participated in the invasion.\\r\\nBeginning at the Cold War's conclusion, in late 1989, popular civil and political public discontent forced the Communist governments of the Warsaw Treaty countries from power, while independent national politics made feasible with the perestroika and glasnost induced institutional collapse of Communist government in the USSR.[50]\\r\\nBetween 1989 and 1991, Communist governments were overthrown in Albania, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.\\r\\nDuring the last acts of the Cold War, several Warsaw Pact states of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary participated in the U.S.-led coalition during the Gulf War.\\r\\nOn 25 February 1991, the Warsaw Pact was declared disbanded at a meeting of defence and foreign ministers from remaining Pact countries meeting in Hungary.[51] On 1 July 1991, in Prague, the Czechoslovak President Vclav Havel formally ended the 1955 Warsaw Treaty Organization of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance and so disestablished the Warsaw Treaty after 36 years of military alliance with the USSR.[52] In fact, the treaty was de facto disbanded in December 1989 during the violent revolution in Romania, which toppled the communist government, without military intervention from other member states.[citation needed] The USSR disestablished itself in December 1991.\\r\\nOn 12 March 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland joined NATO; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia joined in March 2004; Albania joined on 1 April 2009.\\r\\nRussia and some other post-USSR states joined in the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in 1992, or the Shanghai Five in 1996 (renamed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) after Uzbekistan's addition in 2001).\\r\\nIn November 2005, the Polish government opened its Warsaw Treaty archives to the Institute of National Remembrance, who published some 1,300 declassified documents in January 2006. Yet the Polish government reserved publication of 100 documents, pending their military declassification. Eventually, 30 of the reserved 100 documents were published; 70 remained secret and unpublished. Among the documents published is the Warsaw Treaty's nuclear war plan, Seven Days to the River Rhine ÿ a short, swift counter-attack capturing Austria, Denmark, Germany and Netherlands east of River Rhine, using nuclear weapons, in self-defence, after a NATO first strike. The plan originated as a 1979 field training exercise war game and metamorphosed into official Warsaw Treaty battle doctrine, until the late 1980s ÿ which is why the People's Republic of Poland was a nuclear weapons base, first, to 178, then, to 250 tactical-range rockets.

The first Archbishop of Canterbury, Augustine took office in 597 AD. In 601, he baptized the first Christian Anglo-Saxon king, ?thelberht of Kent. The last pagan Anglo-Saxon/Jutish king, Arwald, died in 686.\\r\\n?thelberht of Kent's wife Bertha, daughter of Charibert, one of the Merovingian kings of the Franks, had brought a chaplain (Liudhard) with her. Bertha had restored a church from Roman times to the east of Canterbury and dedicated it to Saint Martin of Tours, the patronal saint for the Merovingian royal family. ?thelberht himself, though a pagan, allowed his wife to worship her God. Probably under influence of his wife, ?thelberht asked Pope Gregory I to send missionaries, and in 596 the Pope dispatched Augustine, together with a party of monks.\\r\\nAugustine had served as praepositus (prior) of the monastery of Saint Andrew in Rome, founded by Gregory. His party lost heart on the way and Augustine went back to Rome from Provence and asked his superiors to abandon the mission project. The pope, however, commanded and encouraged continuation, and Augustine and his followers landed on the Island of Thanet in the spring of 597.\\r\\n?thelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his town of Canterbury. By the end of the year he himself had converted, and Augustine received consecration as a bishop at Arles. At Christmas 10,000 of the king's subjects underwent baptism.\\r\\nAugustine sent a report of his success to Pope Gregory with certain questions concerning his work. In 601 Mellitus, Justus and others brought the pope's replies, with the pallium for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, vestments, relics, books, and the like. Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain as soon as possible twelve suffragan bishops and to send a bishop to York, who should also have twelve suffragans. Augustine did not carry out this papal plan, nor did he establish the primatial see at London as Gregory intended, as the Londoners remained heathen. Augustine did consecrate Mellitus as bishop of London and Justus as bishop of Rochester.\\r\\nPope Gregory issued more practicable mandates concerning heathen temples and usages: he desired that native temples be Christianized and asked Augustine to Christianize pagan practices, so far as possible, into dedication ceremonies or feasts of martyrs, since \\"he who would climb to a lofty height must go up by steps, not leaps\\" (letter of Gregory to Mellitus, in Bede, i, 30).\\r\\nAugustine reconsecrated and rebuilt an old church at Canterbury as his cathedral and founded a monastery in connection with it.

The spokesman of the dominant faction was St. Wilfrid, who had been much impressed by the power and lavish life style of the Roman Church in comparison with the austerity and subservience to local rulers of the Celtic Church. Using subsidiary arguments about Easter and the tonsure, Wilfrid established the model of the Church as not ultimately answerable to the local king but to the Archbishop and to the Pope. It became a tradition for each Archbishop of Canterbury to receive the pallium from the Pope in Rome.

It sought to revive church piety by replacing secular canons- often under the direct influence of local landowners, and often their relatives- with celibate monks, answerable to the ecclesiastical hierarchy and ultimately to the Pope. This deeply split England, bringing it to the point of civil war, with the East Anglian nobility (such as Athelstan Half-King, Byrhtnoth) supporting Dunstan and the Wessex aristocracy (Ordgar, ?thelm?r the Stout) supporting the secularists. These factions mobilsed around King Eadwig (anti-Dunstan) and his brother King Edgar (pro).

See Vespers, Compline, Nocturns, Matins, and Lauds for more information. A vigil is a night spent in prayer.\\r\\nThe practice of rising at about the middle of the night, for the purpose of prayer, is as old as the Church.[1] The word \\"Vigils\\", at first applied to the night office, also comes from a Latin source, both as to the term and its use, namely the vigiliae or nocturnal watches or guards of the soldiers. The night from six o'clock in the evening to six o'clock in the morning was divided into four watches or vigils of three hours each, the first, the second, the third, and the fourth vigil. From the liturgical point of view and in its origin, the use of the term was very vague and elastic. Generally it designated the nightly meetings, synaxes, of the Christians. Under this form, the watch (vigil) might be said to date back as early as the beginning of Christianity. The liturgical service was composed of readings, singing of psalms, and various prayers, followed by the Eucharistic service.[2]\\r\\nDuring the 3rd century and 4th century, in addition to the celebration of Mass, it was customary to hold a vigil, which was a prayer service in three parts, on the night before a feast day. Vigils, in a strict sense, were night-watches in preparation for the feast.[3] Commenced in the evening, they terminated only the following morning, and involved, in addition to the eucharistic supper, homilies, chants, and divers offices.[2]\\r\\nThe Office of the Vigils was a single Office, recited without interruption at midnight. The number of psalms, which at first varied, was subsequently fixed at twelve, with the addition of a lesson from the Old Testament and another from the New Testament.[4] From this vigil service developed three of the canonical hours: Vespers, Matins, and Lauds, inasmuch as the first was prayed the preceding evening, and the last was held in the early hours of the morning. This was the arrangement already in the days of Hippolytus (?236). St.Benedict of Nursia, in his description of the liturgy of the hours, always refers to vigils as the night office. [2] After the vigil service had split into Vespers, Matins, and Lauds, Matins became three divisions known as nightwatches or nocturns.\\r\\nA Roman Catholic Mass that counts liturgically for a Sunday or Holy Day but which takes place the previous evening is often mistakenly[citation needed] called a Vigil Mass. But it is more accurately termed an \\"anticipated Mass,\\"[citation needed] because a Vigil is actually the whole day prior to certain major feasts, which acts as sort of Western version of the forefeast.

The city's major retail districts on the southwest side have likewise seen rapid development.\\r\\nDowntown Fargo has been gentrified due in part to investments by the city and private developers in the Renaissance Zone. Most older neighborhoods, such as Horace Mann, have either avoided decline or been revitalized through housing rehabilitation promoted by planning agencies to strengthen the city's core.\\r\\nNDSU has grown rapidly into a major research university, and forms a major component of the city's identity and economy. Most students live off-campus in the surrounding Roosevelt neighborhood. The university has established a presence downtown through both academic buildings and apartment housing. In addition, NDSU Bison Football has become a major sport following among many area residents.\\r\\nSince the late 1990s, the Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Statistical Area has consistently had one of the lowest unemployment rates among MSAs in the United States. Coupled with Fargo's low crime rate and the decent supply of affordable housing in the community, this has prompted Money magazine to rank the city near the top of its annual list of America's most livable cities throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s.\\r\\nFargo is a core city of the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area, which also includes Moorhead, West Fargo, and Dilworth as well as outlying communities.\\r\\nFargo sits on the western bank of the Red River of the North in a flat geographic region known as the Red River Valley. The Red River Valley resulted from the withdrawal of glacial Lake Agassiz, which drained away about 9,300 years ago. The lake sediments deposited from Lake Agassiz made the land around Fargo some of the richest in the world for agricultural uses.\\r\\nFargo's largest challenge are the seasonal floods due to the rising water of the Red River, which flows from the United States into Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada. The Red flows northward, which means melting snow and river ice, as well as runoff from its tributaries, often create ice dams causing the river to overflow. Fargo's surrounding Red River Valley terrain is essentially flat, leading to overland flooding. Since the potentially devastating flood of 2009, both Fargo and Moorhead have taken great strides in flood protection, only a near record flood would cause concern today.\\r\\nIts location makes the city vulnerable to flooding during seasons with above average precipitation. The Red River's \\"minor\\" flood stage in Fargo begins at a level of 18 feet, with \\"major\\" flooding categorized at 30 feet and above. Many major downtown roadways and access to Moorhead are closed off at this level. Record snowfalls late in 1996 led to flooding in 1997, causing the Red to rise to a record crest of 39.5 feet, nearly overtaking city defenses. In 2008ÿ2009, significant fall precipitation coupled with a rapid snowmelt in March 2009 caused the Red to rise to a new record level of 40.84 feet, but again Fargo remained safe, in large part due to flood mitigation efforts instituted after the 1997 event and sandbagging efforts by the city residents. Further upgrades were made to city infrastructure and additional resources brought to bear following the 2009 flood, which caused no issues for the city in 2010 despite another rapid melt that caused the Red to rise to 37 feet (which ranks among the top ten highest levels ever recorded). Recent discussions have focused on a $1.5 billion diversion project to channel the Red's water away from the city, but such a project is in the planning stages and being evaluated by various government agencies. As of 2012, Fargo has bought 700 houses in flood-prone areas.[15]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 48.82 square miles (126.44?km2), all land.[2]\\r\\nBecause of its location in the Great Plains and its distance from both mountains and oceans, Fargo has a humid continental climate (K?ppen Dfa/Dfb), and is in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 4.[16] The city features winters among the coldest in the continental United States, with lows falling to or below 0?F (?17.8?C) 43 nights per year, and sometimes falling to ?20?F (?28.9?C). Snowfall averages 52 inches (132?cm) per season.[17] Spring and autumn are short and highly variable seasons. Summers have frequent thunderstorms, and highs reach 90?F (32?C) on an average of 12.7 days each year.[17] Annual precipitation of 22.7 inches (577?mm) is concentrated in the warmer months. Extreme temperatures have ranged from ?48?F (?44?C) on January 8, 1887 to 114?F (46?C) on July 6, 1936.[18]\\r\\nIn 2011, Fargo won The Weather Channel's \\"America's Toughest Weather City\\" poll. Almost 850,000 votes, blizzards, cold, and floods were used to determine Fargo as the \\"Toughest Weather City\\" in 2011.[19]\\r\\nAs of the census[3] of 2010, there were 105,549 people residing in the city.

Four commissioners and a mayor are elected at large for four-year terms. Dr. Tim Mahoney is Fargo's current mayor.[25] The Fargo City Commission meets every two weeks in its chambers above the Fargo Civic Center. The meetings are broadcast on a Government-access television (GATV) cable channel.\\r\\nAlthough politically diverse, Fargo and Cass County in general has a history as a Republican-leaning area. Democrats have tended to do well in state elections in the older and established areas of Fargo (Districts 11 and 21), but Republicans have dominated throughout much of the newer areas of the city. George W. Bush carried Fargo as well as the rest of Cass County in the 2004 presidential election, with nearly 60 percent of the vote in both areas. In 2008, Democratic candidate Barack Obama won the majority of votes in Cass County,[26] with a voting percentage very close to the percentage Obama received in the entire nation, while John McCain won the majority of votes in North Dakota. Mitt Romney's margin in 2012 over Barack Obama in Cass County was 49.9% to 47%.[27] while Donald Trump expanded the margin to double digits in 2016 with a 49.2% to 38.8% vote tally against Hillary Clinton.[28]\\r\\nThe economy of the Fargo area has historically been dependent on agriculture. That dominance has decreased substantially in recent decades. Now, the city of Fargo has a growing economy based on food processing, manufacturing, technology, retail trade, higher education, and healthcare. In a study published by Forbes, Fargo was ranked the best small city in the nation to start a business or a career.[29]\\r\\nAccording to the City's 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[30] the largest employers in the city are:\\r\\nThe Fargo Public Schools system serves most of the city, operating fifteen elementary schools, three middle schools, and four high schools: Fargo North High School, Fargo South High School, Judge Ronald N. Davies High School, and an alternative high school (Woodrow Wilson).\\r\\nThe West Fargo Public Schools system serves the southwestern part of the city, in addition to West Fargo itself and the surrounding communities of Horace and Harwood.\\r\\nIn addition to public schools, a number of private schools also operate in the city. The John Paul II Catholic Schools Network operates Holy Spirit Elementary, Nativity Elementary, Sullivan Middle School, and Shanley High School. Additionally, the Oak Grove Lutheran School and Park Christian School (which is in Moorhead, Minnesota) serve grades pre-K through 12, while Grace Lutheran School serves grades pre-K through 8.\\r\\nFargo is home to North Dakota State University (NDSU), which has over 14,500 students. NDSU was founded in 1890 as the state land grant university focusing on agriculture, engineering and science, but has since branched out to cover many other fields of study. NDSU, along with Minnesota State University Moorhead and Concordia College in Moorhead, form the Tri-College University system of Fargo-Moorhead. Students can take classes at any of the three institutions. These three colleges also form a vibrant student-youth community of over 25,000. NDSCS-Fargo is a campus of North Dakota State College of Science. Located in the Skills and Technology Training Center on 19th Avenue North in Fargo, NDSCS-Fargo serves as the home to academic programming and non-credit training.\\r\\nFargo is also home to several private collegiate institutions, including Rasmussen College, a branch location of the University of Mary, and Masters Baptist College operated by Fargo Baptist Church. The University of Jamestown's Doctor of Physical Therapy program is based in Fargo. Until recently, Globe University/Minnesota School of Business maintained a Fargo Student Resource Center, now replaced by the college's Moorhead campus.\\r\\nThe Fargo Public Library was established in 1900 and for many years was housed in a Carnegie-funded building. In 1968, the library moved into a new facility as part of urban renewal efforts in the downtown area. The original 1968 building was demolished and replaced with a new library which opened in 2008. In addition, Fargo Public Library operates the Dr. James Carlson Library in southern Fargo, and the Northport branch in North Fargo. In 2002 and 2006, the Southpointe and Northport Branches were opened serving the city's south and north sides. The Dr. James Carlson Library, which replaced the earlier Southpointe Branch, opened to the public on November 16, 2007. A new main library downtown opened April 25, 2009. The Fargo Public Library is headquartered in downtown Fargo. In 2014, over 1 million items were checked out from Fargo Public Library. \\"Books and magazines made up nearly half of the total and digital media and other non-print items made up more than a third. The rest are inter-library loans and renewals,\\" according to Melisa Duncan, a library spokeswoman.\\"[31]\\r\\nFargo offers a wide variety of cultural opportunities for a city of its size. This is likely due, in part, to the presence of three universities in the area. Most theatre and events are either promoted or produced by the universities, although there are several private theatre companies in the city including Fargo-Moorhead Community Theatre (FMCT), Theatre 'B' in downtown Fargo, Ursa Major Productions, Music Theatre Fargo Moorhead, Tin Roof Theatre Company, The Entertainment Company and others. Music organizations in the area include the Fargo-Moorhead Opera, the Fargo-Moorhead Symphony Orchestra, and the Fargo-Moorhead Youth Symphony. Fargo also boasts a dance company in the Fargo-Moorhead Ballet.\\r\\nThe Fargo Theatre is a restored 1926 Art Deco movie house that features first-run movies, film festivals, and other community events. The Fargodome routinely hosts concerts, Broadway musicals, dance performances, sporting events, as well as fairs and other gatherings.\\r\\nThe Winter Carnival in Fargo is a tradition that began in 1928.\\r\\nThe Plains Art Museum is the largest museum of art in the state. It is in downtown Fargo and features regional and national exhibits. It also houses a large permanent collection of art.

The Fargo area contains the following golf courses: Edgewood Golf Course (18-hole), Fargo Country Club (18-hole) Rose Creek Golf Course (18-hole), El Zagal (9-hole), Prairiewood Golf Course (9-hole), and the new Osgood Golf Course (9-hole). In the winter Edgewood serves as a warming house and also provides cross country skis. Rose Creek and Osgood golf courses offer golfing lessons in the summer months. Fargo also has a skate park near dike west and Island park. Fargo and sister city Moorhead also hold ferry rides during the summer, on the historic Red River, to promote education of the fertile soil of the Red River Valley.\\r\\nFargo has three sister cities:\\r\\nThe Forum of Fargo-Moorhead is the city's major newspaper. The High Plains Reader, an independent weekly newspaper, also operates in the community. North Dakota State University's student paper, The Spectrum, is printed twice weekly during the academic year. The city is also served by other publications such as Area Woman, From House To Home, Bison Illustrated, OPEN Magazine, Fargo Monthly,[33] Design & Living, and Valley Faith.\\r\\nFargo is also home to several radio and television stations. Gray Television owns NBC affiliate KVLY-TV and CBS affiliate KXJB-LD, and Red River Broadcasting owns Fox affiliate KVRR. Forum Communications, which also owns The Forum, owns ABC affiliate WDAY-TV and WDAY radio. Major Market Broadcasting owns independent station KRDK-TV, which was formerly CBS affiliate KXJB.

Oz was created by author L. Frank Baum, who went on to write fourteen full-length Oz books. All of the Baum written books are in the public domain in the United States.[1] Even while he was alive, Baum was styled as \\"the Royal Historian of Oz\\" to emphasize the concept that Oz is an actual place. The illusion created was that characters such as Dorothy and Princess Ozma related their adventures in Oz to Baum themselves, by means of wireless telegraph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaum also wrote Oz-related stage plays: The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1901) with music by Paul Tietjens and Nathaniel D. Mann, The Wizard of Oz (1902) (music by Tietjens et al.; with jokes by Glen MacDonough), The Woggle-Bug (1905) with music by Frederick Chapin, The Rainbow's Daughter, or The Magnet of Love (February 1909) with music by Manuel Klein, revised in April 1909 as Ozma of Oz, and ultimately produced, with music by Louis F. Gottschalk as The Tik-Tok Man of Oz. Also in 1909, he wrote a play called The Girl from Oz. The manuscript is held in the archives at Syracuse University, but apparently its relation to Oz is little more than nominal (it is also known as The Girl from Tomorrow and was later adapted for radio by Frank Joslyn Baum), as is also the case with the short story, \\"The Littlest Giant\\", a rather brutal tale designated in two lines to be in the Gillikin country of Oz. With Gottschalk writing the music, he wrote an unproduced stage version of The Patchwork Girl of Oz in November 1913, that was developed into the film scenario.\\r\\nThe Oz books that were written subsequent to Baum's death can be classified into two categories:\\r\\nThe Oz books of Sherwood Smith, published in 2005 and 2006, are officially recognized as canon by The Baum Trust.\\r\\nRuth Plumly Thompson's style was markedly different from Baum's. Her tales harked back to more traditional fairy tales. She often included a small kingdom, with a prince or princess who saves his or her kingdom and regains the throne or saves Oz from invasion. Thompson even respelled Baum's respelling \\"Nome\\" as the more traditional \\"Gnome\\".\\r\\nIllustrator John R. Neill's vision of Oz is more manic than Thompson or Baum's. Houses often get up and do battle, and everything can be alive. His entries take Oz's color scheme (blue for Munchkin Country, red for Quadling Country, etc.) to an extreme, extending it to sky and skin colors.\\r\\nJack Snow was a Baum scholar, and even offered to take over the series at age twelve when Baum died. Snow's books lack any characters created by Thompson or Neill, although he did create his own.\\r\\nThe last two Oz books published by Reilly & Lee:\\r\\nThe Expeditioneers, as they call themselves, learn the meanings of these fortunes as they progress through an Art Colony, a Game Preserve, and a long and complex subterranean journey.\\r\\nJack Snow wrote Who's Who in Oz, a guide to characters from the first 39 Oz books, as well as a short story titled \\"A Murder in Oz,\\" in which Tip takes his life back from Ozma, and both are ultimately restored as twin siblings.\\r\\nSome are in line with the originals, while others deviate in various ways.\\r\\nBelow are some books which deal with alternate versions of Oz, that do not adhere to the original and official canon by L. Frank Baum.\\r\\nThe novel presents events, characters and situations from Baum's books and the film in new ways, with several differences between the L. Frank Baum series and the Wicked Cycle. These differences arise from the original Oz functioning as a mirror-image of Kansas in a cultural and economic framework: Oz was wealthy, prosperous and had excellent agricultural yields while Kansas was characterized by economic hardship, environmental difficulties and poor harvests. The social strife described in the Wicked Cycle indicates that the two series are set in similar and internally consistent but distinctly separate visions of Oz.\\r\\nThe novel focuses on the life of the Wicked Witch of the West, whom Maguire gives the name Elphaba.\\r\\nUnlike the popular 1939 movie and Baum's writings, this novel is not directed at children, and contains adult language and content.\\r\\nIt is the basis for the Broadway musical Wicked by Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman.","input":"How many books in the wizard of oz?"},{"output":"the village of Plockton, the town of Kyle of Lochalsh and the surrounding area","context":"Hamish Macbeth is a comedy-mystery-drama series made by BBC Scotland and first aired in 1995. It is loosely based on a series of mystery novels by M. C. Beaton (Marion Chesney). The series concerns a local police officer, Constable Hamish Macbeth, in the fictitious town of Lochdubh on the west coast of Scotland. The title character was played by Robert Carlyle. It ran for three series from 1995 to 1997, with the first two series having six episodes and the third having eight.\\r\\nThe series was released on DVD in the United Kingdom and the United States in 2005 and 2006 respectively, with the exception of the first series episode West Coast Story. This was due to rights issues surrounding the episode's extensive use of excerpts from West Side Story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHamish Macbeth, a police constable in the Northern Constabulary, accompanied by his dog, a West Highland Terrier named Wee Jock, keeps the peace in the small town of Lochdubh (pronounced with the guttural 'ch' sound, LoCH-DOO). Macbeth does this in his own way, without undue reliance on the letter of the law and with every intention of avoiding being promoted out of what is his ideal job. He strongly dislikes involvement from Inverness police, and sometimes his main work doesn't seem to be the capture of local very petty criminals, but to keep them away from prison and penalties.\\r\\nThe major running theme of the series is the tension caused by Hamish's attraction to both the journalist of the local newspaper, Isobel Sutherland (Shirley Henderson) and the aristocratic author Alexandra Maclean (Valerie Gogan). Other themes include the clairvoyance of Hamish's friend and co-worker \\"TV John\\", John McIver (Ralph Riach), the not-so-secret romance between the school-teacher Esme Murray and the shopkeeper Rory Campbell, the volatile marriage of the publican Barney Meldrum and his wife Agnes, the schemes of the two Lachie MacCraes, father and son, the laid-back, pipe smoking Doc Brown (Duncan Duff), and Major Peregrine Mclean (David Ashton), father of Alexandra and aristocratic penniless bachelor.\\r\\nThe series was accompanied by the Gaelic music of John Lunn.\\r\\nThe series was filmed on location in the village of Plockton, the town of Kyle of Lochalsh and the surrounding area.

It premiered on NBC, a terrestrial television network, on October 11, 1975 under the title NBC's Saturday Night. The show often satirizes contemporary American popular culture and politics. Saturday Night Live features a two-tiered cast: the repertory members, also known as the \\"Not Ready for Prime-Time Players\\", and newer cast members, known as \\"Featured Players.\\"\\r\\nA typical episode of SNL will feature a single host, who delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast. While the format also features a musical guest, and a number of episodes have featured celebrity cameos, the focus of this article is the guest host.\\r\\nGeorge Carlin was first to host the show; Candice Bergen was the first woman to host the show a few weeks later and again hosted only six weeks after that. Guests that host five times (or more) are members of the Five-Timers Club (see below)a term that originated on December 8, 1990, when Tom Hanks became the seventh person to host their fifth episode.

George Carlin served as the show's first host in October 1975;[1] three episodes later, Candice Bergen became the first female host[2] and the first to host more than once.[3] Actor Alec Baldwin holds the record for most times hosting, having performed the duty on seventeen different occasions since 1990; Baldwin took the record from actor Steve Martin who has hosted fifteen times since 1976.[4]\\r\\nSeveral former cast members have returned to take on hosting duties. Original cast member Chevy Chase has hosted the most times, eight in total. Bill Murray and Tina Fey follow behind, having hosted five times.

Occasionally, the musical guest has also simultaneously served as the host. Paul Simon was the first example, hosting and performing on the second episode on October 18, 1975. As of May 19, 2012, Dave Grohl is the most frequent musical guest, performing on eleven shows since 1992.[7]\\r\\nIn 1982, at age 7, Drew Barrymore became the youngest person to host the show. Actress Betty White is the oldest person to host, having done so at 88 years of age on May 8, 2010.[8] Concerned about White's age and possible fatigue, her episode had Tina Fey, Molly Shannon, Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch and Amy Poehler on standby to replace her; White went on to appear in every sketch.[9] In 2000, singer Britney Spears became the youngest person to both host and simultaneously serve as the show's musical guest, at 18 years and 161 days old.[10]\\r\\nIn addition to making cameo appearances, political figures have also hosted the show.

Now, the first time you do the show, you can't believe you're here. You just can't believe it. Your head buzzes with excitement. The second time you do the show, it means you were funny enough to be asked back - and you're pushing a movie. The third time you do the show, the second time didn't go so well, and you have something to prove to yourself. The fourth time you do the show, you're just blatantly pushing a movie. But the fifth time you do the show is the most special time of all, because you get this [holds up a card] ...a membership card in the Five-Timers Club. Come with me... [walks off the stage] I'm gonna give you a chance to look in on one of the most exclusive clubs in the world.[15]\\r\\nAfter Hanks gave his monologue, the show segued to a sketch featuring Hanks, Steve Martin, Elliott Gould, and Paul Simon in the richly appointed club. Martin and Gould were both five-time hosts; Simon had only hosted four episodes, but was accepted as a member due to his numerous appearances as a musical guest. The Five-Timers Club was mentioned to have a swimming pool with perfect 80 degree waters. The food that is served there is named after SNL performers. Then-Saturday Night Live writer Conan O'Brien portrayed Sean, the doorman of the club. Jon Lovitz appears as a club waiter. Ralph Nader appears as a former SNL host trying to get into the Five-Timers Club only for Lovitz to tell him and his group to leave.\\r\\nThe second time the Five-Timers Club was mentioned was when Danny DeVito was inducted in 1993. The Club was mentioned again after the mark was reached by hosts Alec Baldwin (1994), John Goodman (1994), Christopher Walken (2001), Drew Barrymore (2007), Justin Timberlake (2013), Ben Affleck (2013), Scarlett Johansson (2017), Melissa McCarthy (2017), and Dwayne Johnson (2017); Steve Martin appeared at the end of McCarthy's fifth episode to present her with a jacket, while Alec Baldwin did the same for Dwayne Johnson in the monologue of the season finale. McCarthy had previously mentioned the club on her fourth appearance, when she claimed to be eligible because she had also been in the 40th anniversary special.\\r\\nJustin Timberlake's monologue from March 9, 2013 featured the reappearance of the richly appointed club. The sketch features Paul Simon, Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks, and Candice Bergen. There were portraits of John Goodman and Drew Barrymore in the Five-Timers Club's Hall of Portraits. The staff at the Five-Timers Club are former cast members, with Dan Aykroyd (1975ÿ79) and Martin Short (1984ÿ85) appearing as the club's bartender and waiter, respectively. Future cast member Mike O'Brien makes an appearance as the doorman who greets Justin. The entertainment at the Five-Timers Club involves making the current SNL performers fight each other to the death, with Bobby Moynihan shown fighting Taran Killam. When Melissa McCarthy hosted for show for the fifth time, five-timers club member Steve Martin appeared in the goodnights to welcome her to the club. When Dwayne Johnson hosted the show for the fifth time, five-timers club members Tom Hanks and Alec Baldwin appeared in the monologue to welcome him to the club.\\r\\nSteve Martin was the fastest to join the Five-Timers club, hosting five times in only 546 days. Buck Henry is the only other member to join in less than four years, hosting five times in 671 days, although, in keeping with his persona on the show of being an undesirable or boring host, is said not to have been told about the club itself. The following people are members of the Five-Timers Club.[citation needed]\\r\\na Simon has only guest-hosted four times but has been included in both Five-Timers Club sketches. The show credits him as co-host of the 100th episode even though a host is not officially credited in the opening sequence. His fifth appearance on the show was as a musical guest appearance.\\r\\nb Out of his four appearances as host, Simon acted as both host and musical guest during one episode.\\r\\nc Out of his five appearances as host, Timberlake acted as both host and musical guest during three episodes. During his most recent appearance on December 21, 2013, he was the musical guest while Jimmy Fallon hosted.\\r\\nThe Five-Timers Club has been referenced in other media since its creation in 1990. The entertainment channel E! placed it at No. 22 on its list of SNL top moments.[citation needed] The club was also referenced by Fox Sports as the basis behind the creation of the \\"Favre Backup Club\\" which seeks to be the \\"NFL's equivalent\\" to the Five-Timers Club.[20]","input":"How many times has alec baldwin hosted snl?"},{"output":"Lucille","context":"Lucille is the name B.B. King gave to his guitars. They were usually black Gibson guitars similar to the ES-345-355.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the winter of 1949, King played at a dance hall in Twist, Arkansas. The hall was heated by a barrel half-filled with burning kerosene, a fairly common practice at the time. During a performance, two men began to fight, knocking over the barrel and sending burning fuel across the floor. The hall burst into flames, and the building was evacuated. [1]\\r\\nOnce outside, King realized that he had left his guitar inside so he went back into the burning building to retrieve his beloved $30 Gibson guitar. King learned the next day that the two men that started the fire had been fighting over a woman who worked at the hall named Lucille. King named that guitar, and every guitar he subsequently owned, Lucille, as a reminder never again to do something as stupid as run into a burning building or fight over women.[2]\\r\\nB.B. King wrote a song called Lucille in which he talks about his guitar and how it got its name. The song was first released on the album Lucille and is included on the B. B. King Anthology 1962ÿ1998 album.\\r\\nKing played guitars made by different manufacturers early in his career. He played a Fender Telecaster on most of his recordings with RPM Records (USA).[3] However, he is best known for playing variants of the Gibson ES-335.\\r\\nIn 1980, Gibson Guitar Corporation launched the B. B. King Lucille model.[4] The most noticeable differences between the Lucille and the Gibson ES-355TD-SV on which it is based are the \\"Lucille\\" script on the headstock, the maple neck, and the lack of F-holes on the top. King requested that, to reduce feedback, there be no F-holes.[7]\\r\\nGibson made the B.B. King Standard model from 1980 to 1985. This model had chrome hardware and dot inlays instead of block inlays.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Gibson subsidiary Epiphone markets a low-cost, foreign-made Lucille model based on the Gibson Lucille. Differences include a variation on the headstock inlays, a gloss finish and different pickups.[8]\\r\\nIn 1999, Gibson launched the Little Lucille, a version of their Blueshawk guitar. It differed from the Blueshawk in having a Tune-o-matic bridge and a TP-6 stop tailpiece.[9] Gibson discontinued the Little Lucille and the Blueshawk, on which it was based.\\r\\nIn 2005, for B.B. King's 80th birthday, Gibson made a special run of 80 Gibson Lucilles, referred to as the 80th Birthday Lucille. They presented the first prototype, which was engraved by Baron Technology, Inc, with design work by Scott Jeffrey, to King as a birthday present. King used the guitar as his main guitar until the summer of 2009, when it was stolen. On September 10, 2009, Eric Dahl unknowingly purchased the stolen instrument from a pawn shop in Las Vegas, and was contacted by a Gibson Artist Relations representative, who informed Dahl of the stolen status of the guitar. This Lucille was returned to King in late November 2009.[10]","input":"What is bb king's guitar's name?"},{"output":"Jessica Biel","context":"The Sinner is an American anthology crime drama mystery television series, based on the novel of the same name by German crime writer Petra Hammesfahr.

The ancestry question will return in the 2020 Census.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  July 2016[update], White Americans are the racial majority.  African Americans are the largest racial minority, amounting to an estimated 12.7% of the population. Hispanic and Latino Americans amount to an estimated 17.8% of the total U.S. population, making up the largest ethnic minority.[8] The White, non-Hispanic or Latino population make up 61.3% of the nation's total, with the total White population (including White Hispanics and Latinos) being 76.9%.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite Americans are the majority in every census-defined region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West) and in every state except Hawaii,[10] but contribute the highest proportion of the population in the Midwestern United States, at 85% per the Population Estimates Program (PEP),[4] or 83% per the American Community Survey (ACS).[11][verification needed] Non-Hispanic Whites make up 79% of the Midwest's population, the highest ratio of any region.[5] However, 35% of White Americans (whether all White Americans or non-Hispanic/Latino only) live in the South, the most of any region.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n55% of the African American population lives in the South.[4] A plurality or majority of the other official groups reside in the West. The latter region is home to 42% of Hispanic and Latino Americans, 46% of Asian Americans, 48% of American Indians and Alaska Natives, 68% of Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, 37% of the \\"two or more races\\" population (Multiracial Americans), and 46% of those self-designated as \\"some other race\\".[4][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2000 Census and subsequent United States Census Bureau surveys, Americans self-described as belonging to these racial groups:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach person has two identifying attributes, racial identity and whether or not they are of Hispanic ethnicity.[19] These categories are sociopolitical constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature.[2] They have been changed from one census to another, and the racial categories include both \\"racial\\" and national-origin groups.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the US Department of Labor finalized its update of the EEO-1 report format and guidelines to come into an effect on September 30, 2007. In particular, this update concerns the definitions of racial/ethnic categories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question on Hispanic or Latino origin is separate from the question on race.[3][22] Hispanic and Latino Americans have ethnic origins in the countries of Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula. Latin American countries are, like the United States, racially diverse.[23] Consequently, no separate racial category exists for Hispanic and Latino Americans, as they do not constitute a race, nor a national group.  When responding to the race question on the census form, each person is asked to choose from among the same racial categories as all Americans, and are included in the numbers reported for those races.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach racial category may contain Non-Hispanic or Latino and Hispanic or Latino Americans. For example: the White (European-American) race category contains Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanic Whites (see White Hispanic and Latino Americans); the Black or African-American category contains Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanic Blacks (see Black Hispanic and Latino Americans); the Asian-American category contains Non-Hispanic Asians and Hispanic Asians (see Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans); and likewise for all the other categories. See the section on Hispanic and Latino Americans in this article.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-identifying as both Hispanic or Latino and not Hispanic or Latino is neither explicitly allowed nor explicitly prohibited.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States since its early history, Native Americans, Africans and Europeans were considered to belong to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria for membership in these groups were similar, comprising a person's appearance, their social circle (how they lived), and their known non-White ancestry. History played a part, as persons with known slave ancestors were assumed to be African (or, in later usage, black), regardless of whether they also had European ancestry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe differences between how Native American and Black identities are defined today (blood quantum versus one-drop and political assumptions) have been based on different historical circumstances. According to the anthropologist Gerald Sider, such racial designations were a means to concentrate power, wealth, privilege and land in the hands of Whites in a society of White hegemony and privilege (Sider 1996; see also Fields 1990). The differences had little to do with biology and more to do with the history of slavery and its racism, and specific forms of White supremacy (the social, geopolitical and economic agendas of dominant Whites vis--vis subordinate Blacks and Native Americans). They related especially to the different social places which Blacks and Amerindians occupied in White-dominated 19th-century America. Sider suggests that the blood quantum definition of Native American identity enabled mixed-race Whites to acquire Amerindian lands during the allotment process. The one-drop rule of Black identity, enforced legally in the early 20th century, enabled Whites to preserve their agricultural labor force in the South. The contrast emerged because, as peoples transported far from their land and kinship ties on another continent, Black labor was relatively easy to control, and they became reduced to valuable commodities as agricultural laborers. In contrast, Amerindian labor was more difficult to control; moreover, Amerindians occupied large territories that became valuable as agricultural lands, especially with the invention of new technologies such as railroads. Sider thinks the blood quantum definition enhanced White acquisition of Amerindian lands in a doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which subjected Native Americans to marginalization and resulted in numerous conflicts related to American expansionism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe political economy of race had different consequences for the descendants of aboriginal Americans and African slaves. The 19th-century blood quantum rule meant that it was relatively easier for a person of mixed Euro-Amerindian ancestry to be accepted as White. The offspring of a few generations of intermarriage between Amerindians and Whites likely would not have been considered Amerindian (at least not in a legal sense). Amerindians could have treaty rights to land, but because an individual with only one Amerindian great-grandparent no longer was classified as Amerindian, he lost a legal claim to Amerindian land, under the allotment rules of the day. According to Sider's theory, Whites were more easily able to acquire Amerindian lands. On the other hand, the same individual who could be denied legal standing in a tribe, according to the government, because he was \\"too White\\" to claim property rights, might still have enough visually identifiable Amerindian ancestry to be considered socially as a \\"half-breed\\" or breed, and stigmatized by both communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 20th-century one-drop rule made it relatively difficult for anyone of known Black ancestry to be accepted as White. The child of an African-American sharecropper and a White person was considered Black by the local communities. In terms of the economics of sharecropping, such a person also would likely become a sharecropper as well, thus adding to the landholder or employer's labor force. In short, this theory suggests that in a 20th-century economy that benefited from sharecropping, it was useful to have as many Blacks as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough some scholars of the Jim Crow period agree that the 20th-century notion of invisible Blackness shifted the color line in the direction of paleness, and \\"expanded\\" the labor force in response to Southern Blacks' Great Migration to the North. But, others (such as the historians Joel Williamson, C. Vann Woodward, George M. Fredrickson, and Stetson Kennedy) considered the one-drop rule a consequence of the need to define Whiteness as being pure, and justifying White-on-Black oppression.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the centuries when Whites wielded power over both Blacks and Amerindians and believed in their inherent superiority over people of color, they created a social order of hypodescent, in which they assigned mixed-race children to the lower-status groups. They were often ignorant of the systems among Native American tribes of social classification, including kinship and hypodescent. The Omaha people, for instance, who had a patrilineal kinship system, classified all children with white fathers as \\"white\\", and excluded them as members of the clans and tribe, unless one was formally adopted by a male member. Tribal members might care for mixed-race children of white fathers, but considered them outside the hereditary clan and kinship fundamental to tribal society.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypodescent social construction related to the racial caste that was associated with African slavery and the conditions of the slave societies. It was made explicit by Virginia and other colonies' laws as early as 1662. Virginia incorporated the Roman principle of partus sequitur ventrem into slave law, saying that children of slave mothers were born into their status. Under English common law for subjects, children's social status was determined by the father, not the mother. But the colonists put Africans outside the category of English subjects. Generally, white men were in positions of power to take sexual advantage of black women slaves. But, historian Paul Heinegg has shown that most free African-American families listed in the censuses of 1790ÿ1810 were, in fact, descended from unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, from the years when working classes lived and worked closely together, and before slavery had hardened as a racial caste.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, social and legal conventions developed over time by whites that classified individuals of mixed ancestry into simplified racial categories (Gossett 1997), but these were always porous. The decennial censuses conducted since 1790, after slavery was well established in the United States, included classification of persons by race: white, black, mulatto, and Indian (Nobles 2000). But, the inclusion of mulatto was an explicit acknowledgement of mixed race. In addition, before the Civil War, Virginia and some other states had legal definition of \\"whiteness\\" that provided for people being classified as white if no more than 1/8 black. (For example, if not born into slavery, Thomas Jefferson's children by his slave Sally Hemings would have been classified as legally white, as they were 7/8 white by ancestry. Three of the four surviving children entered white society as adults, and their descendants have identified as white.) In the late 18th and 19th centuries, people of mixed race often migrated to frontiers where societies were more open, and they might be accepted as white if satisfying obligations of citizenship.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more familiar \\"one-drop rule\\" was not adopted by Virginia and other states until the 20th century, but it classified persons with any known African ancestry as black (Davis 2001). Passage of such laws was often urged by white supremacists and people promoting \\"racial purity\\" through eugenics, having forgotten the long history of multi-racial unions in the South that comprised the ancestry of many families.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other countries in the Americas, where mixing among groups was overtly more extensive, social categories have tended to be more numerous and fluid. In some cases, people may move into or out of categories on the basis of a combination of socioeconomic status, social class, ancestry, and appearance (M?rner 1967).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term Hispanic as an ethnonym emerged in the 20th century, with the rise of migration of laborers from Spanish-speaking countries of the western hemisphere to the United States. It includes people who may have been considered racially distinct (Black, White, Amerindian or other mixed groups) in their home countries. Today, the word \\"Latino\\" is often used as a synonym for \\"Hispanic\\". Even if such categories were earlier understood as racial categories, today they have begun to represent ethno-linguistic categories (regardless of perceived race). Similarly, \\"Anglo\\" is now used among many Hispanics to refer to non-Hispanic White Americans or European Americans, most of whom speak the English language but are not of primarily English descent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States is a racially diverse country. The growth of the Hispanic population through immigration and high birth rates is noted as a partial factor for the US' population gains in the last quarter-century. The 2000 census revealed that Native Americans had reached their highest documented population, 4.5 million, since the US was founded in 1776.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immigrants to the New World came largely from widely separated regions of the Old World. In the Americas, the immigrant populations began to mix among themselves and with the indigenous inhabitants of the continents. In the United States, for example, most people who identify as African American have some European ancestors, as revealed by genetic studies. In one analysis of those genetic markers that have differing frequencies between continents, European ancestry ranged from an estimated 7% for a sample of Jamaicans to ~?23?% for a sample of African Americans from New Orleans, where there was historically a large class of mixed race (now called Louisiana Creoles) (Parra et al. 1998).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States since its early history, Native Americans, African Americans, and European Americans were classified as belonging to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria among whites for membership in these groups were similar, comprising physical appearance, assumption of non-European ancestry, and social circle. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During and after Reconstruction, after the emancipation of slaves after the Civil War, in the effort to restore white supremacy in the South, whites began to classify anyone with \\"one drop\\" of \\"black blood\\", or known African ancestry, to be black. Such a legal definition was not put into law until the early 20th century in most southern states, but many established racial segregation of facilities during the Jim Crow era, after white Democrats regained control of state legislatures in the South.\\r\\n\\r\\nEfforts to track mixing between groups led to an earlier proliferation of historical categories (such as \\"mulatto\\" and \\"octaroon\\" among persons with partial African descent) and \\"blood quantum\\" distinctions, which became increasingly untethered from self-reported ancestry. In the 20th century, efforts to classify the increasingly mixed population of the United States into discrete categories generated many difficulties (Spickard 1992). By the standards used in past censuses, many mixed-race children born in the United States were classified as of a different race than one of their biological parents. In addition, a person may change personal racial identification over time because of cultural aspects, and self-ascribed race can differ from assigned race (Kressin et al. 2003).\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 2000 census, Latinos were required to identify as one race, and none was Latino. Partly as a result of the confusion generated by the distinction, 32.9% (U.S. census records) of Latino respondents in the 2000 census ignored the specified racial categories and checked \\"some other race\\". (Mays et al. 2003 claim a figure of 42%)\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorical trends influencing the ethnic demographics of the United States include:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some cases, immigrants and migrants form ethnic enclaves; in others, mixture creates ethnically diverse neighborhoods.\\r\\n\\r\\n(For demographics by specific ethnic groups rather than general race, see \\"Ancestry\\" below.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of people currently living in the United States are White and European Americans. The United States Census Bureau defines White people as those \\"having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.\\"[27] Like all official U.S. racial categories, \\"White\\" has a \\"not Hispanic or Latino\\" and a \\"Hispanic or Latino\\" component,[28] the latter consisting mostly of White Mexican Americans and White Cuban Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite Americans are the majority in 49 of the 50 states, with Hawaii as the exception. Non-Hispanic Whites are the majority in 46 states; Hawaii, New Mexico, California, and Texas (and the District of Columbia) are the exceptions.[29] These five jurisdictions have \\"minority majorities\\", i.e. minority groups compose the majority of the population.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe non-Hispanic White percentage (63% in 2012[5]) tends to decrease every year, and this sub-group is expected to become a plurality of the overall U.S. population after the year 2043. White Americans overall (non-Hispanic Whites together with White Hispanics) are projected to continue as the majority, at 73.1% (or 303 million out of 420 million) in 2050, from currently 77.1%.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough a high proportion of the population is known to have multiple ancestries, in the 2000 census, the first with the option to choose more than one, most people still identified with one racial category.[citation needed] In the 2000 census, self-identified German Americans made up 17.1% of the U.S. population, followed by Irish Americans at 12%, as reported in the 2000 U.S. Census. This makes German and Irish the largest and second-largest self-reported ancestry groups in the United States. Both groups had high rates of immigration to the U.S. beginning in the mid-19th century, triggered by the Great Famine in Ireland and the failed 1848 Revolution in Germany. However, English Americans and British Americans are still considered the largest ethnic group due to a serious under count following the 2000 census whereby many English and British Americans self-identified under the new category entry 'American' considering themselves 'indigenous' because their families had resided in the US for so long[30][31][32][33] or, if of mixed European ancestry, identified with a more recent and differentiated ethnic group.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\n7.2% of the population listed their ancestry as American on the 2000 census (see American ethnicity). According to the United States Census Bureau, the number of people in the U.S. who reported American and no other ancestry increased from 12.4 million in 1990 to 20.2 million in 2000. This change in reporting represented the largest \\"growth\\" of any ethnic group in the United States during the 1990s, but it represented how people reported themselves more than growth through birth rates, for instance, and certainly did not reflect immigration.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost French Americans are believed descended from colonists of Catholic New France; exiled Huguenots, much fewer in number and settling in the eastern English colonies in the late 1600s and early 1700s, needed to assimilate into the majority culture and have intermarried over generations. Isle?os of Louisiana and the Hispanos of the Southwest have had, in part, direct Spanish ancestry; most self-reported White Hispanics are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban origins, each of which are multi-ethnic nations. Hispanic immigration has increased from nations of Central and South America.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack and African Americans are citizens and residents of the United States with origins in Sub-Saharan Africa.[36] According to the Office of Management and Budget, the grouping includes individuals who self-identify as African-American, as well as persons who emigrated from nations in the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa.[37] The grouping is thus based on geography, and may contradict or misrepresent an individual's self-identification since not all immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa are \\"Black\\". Among these racial outliers are persons from Cape Verde, Madagascar, various Hamito-Semitic populations in East Africa and the Sahel, and the Afrikaners of Southern Africa including such notable figures as the inventor Elon Musk and actress Charlize Theron.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans, and formerly as American Negroes) are citizens or residents of the United States who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa.[38] According to the 2009 American Community Survey, there were 38,093,725 Black and African Americans in the United States, representing 12.4% of the population. There were 37,144,530 non-Hispanic blacks, which comprised 12.1% of the population.[39] This number increased to 42 million according to the 2010 United States Census, when including Multiracial African Americans,[37] making up 14% of the total U.S. population.[a][41] Black and African Americans make up the second largest group in the United States, but the third largest group after White Americans and Hispanic or Latino Americans (of any race).[42] The majority of the population (55%) lives in the South; compared to the 2000 Census, there has also been a decrease of African Americans in the Northeast and Midwest.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost African Americans are the direct descendants of captives from West Africa, who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present United States.[43] As an adjective, the term is usually written African-American.[44] The first West Africans were brought to Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The English settlers treated these captives as indentured servants and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually replaced by the system of race-based slavery used in the Caribbean.[45] All the American colonies had slavery, but it was usually the form of personal servants in the North (where 2% of the people were slaves), and field hands in plantations in the South (where 25% were slaves);[46] by the beginning of the American Revolutionary War 1/5th of the total population was enslaved.[47] During the revolution, some would serve in the Continental Army or Continental Navy,[48][49] while others would serve the British Empire in Lord Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment, and other units.[50] By 1804, the northern states (north of the MasonÿDixon line) had abolished slavery.[51] However, slavery would persist in the southern states until the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.[52] Following the end of the Reconstruction Era, which saw the first African American representation in Congress,[53] African Americans became disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws,[54] legislation that would persist until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 due to the Civil Rights Movement.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to US Census Bureau data, very few African immigrants self-identify as African-American. On average, less than 5% of African residents self-reported as \\"African-American\\" or \\"Afro-American\\" on the 2000 US Census. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants (~95%) identified instead with their own respective ethnicities. Self-designation as \\"African-American\\" or \\"Afro-American\\" was highest among individuals from West Africa (4%-9%), and lowest among individuals from Cape Verde, East Africa and Southern Africa (0%-4%).[56] Nonetheless, African immigrants often develop very successful professional and business working-relationships with African-Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, \\"Hispanic or Latino origin\\" was the self-identification of 47 million Americans. They chiefly have origins in the Spanish-speaking nations of Latin America. Very few also come from other places, for example: 0.2% of Hispanic and Latino Americans were born in Asia.[57] The group is heterogeneous in race and national ancestry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Census Bureau defines \\"Hispanic or Latino origin\\" thus:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leading country-of-origin for Hispanic Americans is Mexico (30.7 million), followed by Puerto Rico (4.2 million) (which actually has a special relationship with the US, of which its people are citizens), and Cuba (1.6 million), as of 2008.[59] However, as of 2010, there were 1,648,968 Salvadorans in the United States, the largest of the U.S.-Central American community. Salvadorans are poised to become the third largest Hispanic group by the next census, significantly overtaking and replacing Cubans.[60] Recent estimates already put the Salvadoran population as high as 2 million, as of 2013, the third largest Hispanic-American group.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\n62.4% of Hispanic and Latino Americans identified as white.[12] 30.5% identified as \\"some other race\\" (other than the ones listed). According to the PEP  91.9% of Latinos are white, as these official estimates do not recognize \\"some other race\\".[5] In the official estimates, Black or African American Hispanics are the second-largest group, with 1.9 million, or 4.0% of the whole group. The remaining Hispanics are accounted as follows, first per the PEP: 1.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.5% two or more races, 0.7% Asian, and 0.03% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. Per the ACS: 3.9% two or more races, 1.9% Black or African American, 1.0% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.4% Asian, and 0.05% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States the Hispanic and Latino population has reached 58 million in 2016. According to Pew Research Center the Latino population has been the principal driver of United States demographic growth since 2000. Mexicans make up most of the Hispanic and Latino population 35,758,000. There is also a growth of Hispanics who are receiving a college education in 2015, 40% of Hispanics age 25 and older have had a college experience. In 2000 the percentage was at a low 30%. In all the 50 US states California houses the largest population percentage of Latinos. In 2015, 15.2 million Hispanics lived in California.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hispanic or Latino population is young and fast-growing, due to immigration and higher birth rates.[57] For decades it has contributed significantly to U.S. population increases, and this is expected to continue. The Census Bureau projects that by 2050, one-quarter of the population will be Hispanic or Latino.[63][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nA third significant minority is the Asian American population, comprising 19.4 million in 2013, or 6.0% of the U.S. population.[11] California is home to 4.5 million Asian Americans, whereas 495,000 live in Hawaii, where they compose the plurality, at 38.5% of the islands' people. This is their largest share of any state.[65] Historically first concentrated on Hawaii and the West Coast, Asian Americans now live across the country, living and working in large numbers in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Houston, and other major urban centers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir histories are diverse. As with the new immigration from central and eastern Europe to the East Coast from the mid-19th century on, Asians started immigrating to the United States in large numbers in the 19th century. This first major wave of immigration consisted predominantly of Chinese and Japanese laborers, but also included Korean and South Asian immigrants. Many immigrants also came during and after this period from the Philippines, which was a US colony from 1898 to 1946. Exclusion laws and policies largely prohibited and curtailed Asian immigration until the 1940s. After the US changed its immigration laws during the 1940s to 1960s to make entry easier, a much larger new wave of immigration from Asia began. Today the largest self-identified Asian American sub-groups according to census data are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Indian Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Korean Americans, and Japanese Americans, among other groups.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas, particularly Native Americans, made up 0.8% of the population in 2008, numbering 2.4 million.[11] An additional 2.3 million persons declared part-American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legal and official designation of who is Native American has aroused controversy by demographers, tribal nations, and government officials for many decades. Federally recognized tribes and state recognized tribes set their own membership requirements; tribal enrollment may require residency on a reservation, documented lineal descent from recognized records, such as the Dawes Rolls, and other criteria. Some tribes have adopted the use of blood quantum, requiring members to have a certain percentage. The federal government requires individuals to certify documented blood quantum of ancestry for certain federal programs, such as education benefits, available to members of recognized tribes. But Census takers accept any respondent's identification. Genetic scientists estimated that more than 15 million other Americans, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans (specifically those of Mexican heritage), may have up to one quarter of American Indian ancestry.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce thought to face extinction as a race or culture, Native Americans of numerous tribes have achieved revival of aspects of their cultures, together with asserting their sovereignty and direction of their own affairs since the mid-20th century. Many have started language programs to revive use of traditional languages; some have established tribally controlled colleges and other schools on their reservations, so that education is expressive of their cultures. Since the late 20th century, many tribes have developed gaming casinos on their sovereign land to raise revenues for economic development, as well as to promote the education and welfare of their people through health care and construction of improved housing.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday more than 800,000 to one million persons claim Cherokee descent in part or as full-bloods; of these, an estimated 300,000 live in California, 70,000160,000 in Oklahoma, and 15,000 in North Carolina in ancestral homelands.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second largest tribal group is the Navajo, who call themselves Din and live on a 16-million acre (65,000?km2) Indian reservation covering northeast Arizona, northwest New Mexico, and southeast Utah. It is home to half of the 450,000 Navajo Nation members.[citation needed] The third largest group are the Lakota (Sioux) Nation, with distinct federally recognized tribes located in the states of Minnesota, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming; and North and South Dakota.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNative Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders numbered 427,810 in 2008, or 0.1% of the population.[11] Additionally, nearly as many individuals identify as having partial Native Hawaiian ancestry, for a total of 829,949 people of full or part Native Hawaiian ancestry.[68] This group constitutes the smallest minority in the United States. More than half identify as \\"full-blooded\\", but historically most Native Hawaiians on the island chain of Hawaii are believed to have admixture with Asian and European ancestries.[citation needed] But, the Census takes reporting by individuals as to how they identify.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome demographers believe that by the year 2025, the last full-blooded Native Hawaiian will die off, leaving a culturally distinct, but racially mixed population.[citation needed] The total number of persons who have identified as Native Hawaiian in 2008 was more than the estimated Hawaiian population when the US annexed the islands in 1898.[citation needed] Native Hawaiians are receiving ancestral land reparations. Throughout Hawaii, they are working to preserve and assert adaptation of Native Hawaiian customs and the Hawaiian language. They have cultural schools solely for legally Native Hawaiian students.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Arab American Institute (AAI), countries of origin for Arab Americans include Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are an estimated 1.9-2.0 million Middle Eastern Americans according to the U.S. Census,[70] including both Arab and non-Arab Americans,[71] comprising 0.6% of the total U.S. population; however, the Arab American Institute estimates a population closer to 3.6 million.[72] U.S. Census population estimates are based on responses to the ancestry question on the census, which makes it difficult to accurately count Middle Eastern Americans.[72][73] Though Middle Eastern American communities can be found in each of the 50 states, the majority live in just 10 states with nearly \\"one third of the total liv[ing] in California, New York, and Michigan\\".[74] More Middle Eastern Americans live in California than any other state, but Middle Eastern Americans represent the highest percentage of the population of Michigan.[74] In particular, Dearborn, Michigan has long been home to a high concentration of Middle Eastern Americans.[75][76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Census Bureau is presently finalizing the ethnic classification of MENA populations. In 2012, prompted in part by post-9/11 discrimination, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee petitioned the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency to designate the MENA populations as a minority/disadvantaged community.[77] Following consultations with MENA organizations, the US Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would establish a new MENA ethnic category for populations from the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab world, separate from the \\"white\\" classification that these populations had previously sought in 1909. The expert groups, including some Jewish organizations, felt that the earlier \\"white\\" designation no longer accurately represents MENA identity, so they successfully lobbied for a distinct categorization.[16][78] This process does not currently include ethnoreligious groups such as Jews or Sikhs, as the Bureau only tabulates these groups as followers of religions rather than members of ethnic groups.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of December 2015, the sampling strata for the new MENA category includes the Census Bureau's working classification of 19 MENA groups, as well as Turkish, Sudanese, Somali, Mauritanian, Armenian, Cypriot, Afghan, Azerbaijani and Georgian groups.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-identified multiracial Americans numbered 7.0 million in 2008, or 2.3% of the population.[11] They have identified as any combination of races (White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, \\"some other race\\") and ethnicities.[81] The U.S. has a growing multiracial identity movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the colonies and southern states protected white fathers by making all children born to slave mothers be classified as slaves, regardless of paternity, they also banned miscegenation or interracial marriage, most notably between whites and blacks. This did little to stop interracial relationships, except as legal, consensual unions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemographers state that, due to new waves of immigration, the American people through the early 20th century were mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various immigrant nationalities, who maintained cultural distinctiveness until, over time, assimilation, migration and integration took place.[citation needed] The Civil Rights Movement through the 20th century gained passage of important legislation to enforce constitutional rights of minorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, by some calculations in the 2000 Census, the multiracial population that is part white (which is the largest percentage of the multiracial population), is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2002 study found an average of 18.6% European genetic contribution and 2.7% Native American genetic contribution (with standard errors 1.5% and 1.4% respectively) in a sample of 232 African Americans. Meanwhile, in a sample of 187 European Americans from State College, Pennsylvania, there was an average of 0.7% West African genetic contribution and 3.2% Native American genetic contribution (with standard errors 0.9% and 1.6% respectively). Most of the non-European admixture was concentrated in 30% of the sample, with West African admixture ranging from 2 to 20%, with an average of 2.3%.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1958 Robert Stuckert produced a statistical analysis using historical census data and immigration statistics. He concluded that the growth in the White population could not be attributed solely to births in the White population and immigration from Europe, but was also due to people identifying as white who were partly black. He concluded that 21 percent of white Americans had some recent African-American ancestors. He also concluded that the majority of Americans of known African descent were partly European and not entirely sub-Saharan African.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, many different DNA studies have shown that many African Americans have European admixture, reflecting the long history in this country of the various populations. Proportions of European admixture in African-American DNA have been found in studies to be 17?%[85] and between 10.6% and 22.5%.[86] Another recent study found the average to be 21.2%, with a standard error of 1.2%.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Race, Ethnicity, and Genetics Working Group of the National Human Genome Research Institute notes that \\"although genetic analyses of large numbers of loci can produce estimates of the percentage of a person's ancestors coming from various continental populations, these estimates may assume a false distinctiveness of the parental populations, since human groups have exchanged mates from local to continental scales throughout history.\\"[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2000 census, the non-standard category of \\"Other\\"[3] was especially intended to capture responses such as Mestizo and Mulatto,[18] two large multiracial groups in most of the countries of origin of Hispanic and Latino Americans. However, many other responses are captured by the category.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008 15.0 million people, nearly 5% of the total U.S. population, were estimated to be \\"some other race\\",[11] with 95% of them being Hispanic or Latino.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to this category's non-standard status, statistics from government agencies other than the Census Bureau (for example: the Centers for Disease Control's data on vital statistics, or the FBI's crime statistics), but also the Bureau's own official Population Estimates, omit the \\"some other race\\" category and include most of the people in this group in the white population, thus including the vast majority (about 90%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the white population. For an example of this, see The World Factbook, published by the Central Intelligence Agency.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancestry of the people of the United States of America is widely varied and includes descendants of populations from around the world. In addition to its variation, the ancestry of people of the United States is also marked by varying amounts of intermarriage between ethnic and racial groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some Americans can trace their ancestry back to a single ethnic group or population in Europe, Africa, or Asia, these are often first- and second-generation Americans.  Generally, the degree of mixed heritage increases the longer one's ancestors have lived in the United States (see melting pot). In theory, there are several means available to discover the ancestry of the people residing in the United States, including genealogy, genetics, oral and written history, and analysis of Federal Population Census schedules. In practice, only few of these have been used for a larger part of the population.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the 2010ÿ2015 American Community Survey, the twenty largest ancestry groups in the United States were (see above for the OMB self-designation options):[90][91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese images display frequencies of self-reported ancestries, as of the 2000 U.S. Census.

If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize tenancies in common and joint tenancies, and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety. Many jurisdictions refer to a joint tenancy as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase joint tenancy as synonymous with a tenancy in common.\\r\\nThe type of ownership determines the rights of the parties to sell their interest in the property to others, to will the property to their devisees, or to sever their joint ownership of the property. Just as each of these affords a different set of rights and responsibilities to the co-owners of property, each requires a different set of conditions to exist.\\r\\nLaw can vary from place to place, and the following general discussion will not be applicable in its entirety to all jurisdictions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the common law, Co-owners share a number of rights by default:\\r\\nCo-owners generally do not have any obligation to contribute to any costs of improving the property. If one co-owner adds a feature that enhances the value of the property, that co-owner has no right to demand that any others share the cost of adding that feature?ÿ  even if other co-owners reap greater profits from the property because of it. However, at partition, a co-owner is entitled to recover the value added by his or her improvements of the property if the \\"improvements\\" resulted in an increase in property value. Conversely, if the co-owner's \\"improvements\\" decrease the value of the property, the co-owner is responsible for the decrease. In an Australian case,[1] the High Court said that the costs of repairing by one co-owner must be taken into account on the partition or final distribution (i.e. sale) of the property.\\r\\nFurthermore, each co-owner can independently encumber the co-owner's own share in the property by taking out a mortgage on that share (although this may effectively convert a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common, as described below); other co-owners have no obligation to help pay a mortgage that only runs to another owner's share of the property, and the mortgagee can only foreclose on that mortgagor's share. Bank loans secured by mortgages on individual shares of co-owned property are one of the most rapidly expanding areas in the mortgage lending industry.\\r\\nFinally, co-owners owe one another a duty of fair dealing. Because of this, any co-owner who acquires a mortgage claim against the property must give his co-owners a reasonable opportunity to purchase proportionate shares in that claim.\\r\\nTenancy in common is a form of concurrent estate in which each owner, referred to as a tenant in common, is regarded by the law as owning separate and distinct shares of the same property. By default, all co-owners own equal shares, but their interests may differ in size.\\r\\nTIC owners own percentages in an undivided property rather than particular units or apartments, and their deeds show only their ownership percentages. The right of a particular TIC owner to use a particular dwelling comes from a written contract signed by all co-owners (often called a Tenancy In Common Agreement), not from a deed, map or other document recorded in county records.[2] This form of ownership is most common where the co-owners are not married or have contributed different amounts to the purchase of the property. The assets of a joint commercial partnership might be held as a tenancy in common.\\r\\nTenants in common have no right of survivorship, meaning that if one tenant in common dies, that tenant's interest in the property will be part of his or her estate and pass by inheritance to that owner's devisees or heirs, either by will, or by intestate succession. Also, as each tenant in common has an interest in the property, they may, in the absence of any restriction agreed to between all the tenants in common, sell or otherwise deal with the interest in the property (e.g. mortgage it) during their lifetime, like any other property interest.\\r\\nWhere any party to a tenancy in common wishes to terminate (usually termed \\"destroy\\") the joint interest, he or she may obtain a partition of the property. This is a division of the land into distinctly owned lots, if such division is legally permitted under zoning and other local land use restrictions. Where such division is not permitted, a forced sale of the property is the only alternative, followed by a division of the proceeds. (This paragraph is not the case in the law of England and Wales)\\r\\nIf the parties are unable to agree to a partition, any or all of them may seek the ruling of a court to determine how the land should be divided?ÿ  physically division between the joint owners (partition in kind), leaving each with ownership of a portion of the property representing their share. Courts may also order a partition by sale in which the property is sold and the proceeds are distributed to the owners. Where local law does not permit physical division, the court must order a partition by sale.\\r\\nEach co-owner is entitled to partition as a matter of right, meaning that the court will order a partition at the request of any of the co-owners. The only exception to this general rule is where the co-owners have agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to waive the right of partition. The right may be waived either permanently, for a specific period of time, or under certain conditions. The court, however, will likely not enforce this waiver because it is a restraint on the alienability of property.[3]\\r\\nA joint tenancy or joint tenancy with right of survivorship (JTROS, JTWROS or JT TEN WROS) is a type of concurrent estate in which co-owners have a right of survivorship, meaning that if one owner dies, that owner's interest in the property will pass to the surviving owner or owners by operation of law, and avoiding probate. The deceased owner's interest in the property simply evaporates and cannot be inherited by his or her heirs. Under this type of ownership, the last owner living owns all the property, and on his or her death the property will form part of their estate. Unlike a tenancy in common, where co-owners may have unequal interests in a property, joint co-owners have an equal share in the property.[4]\\r\\nIt is important to note, however, that creditors' claims against the deceased owner's estate may, under certain circumstances, be satisfied by the portion of ownership previously owned by the deceased, but now owned by the survivor or survivors. In other words, the deceased's liabilities can sometimes remain attached to the property.\\r\\nThis form of ownership is common between wife and husband, and parent and child, and in any other situation where parties want ownership to pass immediately and automatically to the survivor. For bank and brokerage accounts held in this fashion, the acronym JTWROS is commonly appended to the account name as evidence of the owners' intent.\\r\\nTo create a joint tenancy, clear language indicating that intent must be used?ÿ  e.g. \\"to AB and CD as joint tenants with right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common\\". This long form of wording may be especially appropriate in those jurisdictions which use the phrase \\"joint tenancy\\" as synonymous with a tenancy in common. Shorter forms such as \\"to AB and CD as joint tenants\\" or \\"to AB and CD jointly\\" can be used in most jurisdictions. Words to that effect may be used by the parties in the deed of conveyance or other instrument of transfer of title, or by a testator in a will, or in an inter vivos trust deed.\\r\\nIf a testator leaves property in a will to several beneficiaries \\"jointly\\" and one or more of those named beneficiaries dies before the will takes effect, then the survivors of those named beneficiaries will inherit the whole property on a joint tenancy basis. But if these named beneficiaries had been bequeathed the property on a tenancy in common basis, but died before the will took effect, then those beneficiaries' heirs would in turn inherit their share immediately (the named beneficiary being deceased).\\r\\nTo create a joint tenancy, the co-owners must share \\"four unities\\":\\r\\nIf any of these elements is missing, the joint tenancy is ineffective, and the joint tenancy will be treated as a tenancy in common in equal shares.\\r\\nIf any joint co-owner deals in any way with a property inconsistent with a joint tenancy, that co-owner will be treated as having terminated (sometimes called \\"breaking\\") the joint tenancy. The remaining co-owners maintain joint ownership of the remaining interest. The dealing may be a conveyance or sale of the co-owner's share in the property. The position in relation to a mortgage is more doubtful (see below). For example, if one of three joint co-owners conveys his or her share in the property to a third party, the third party owns a 1/3 share on a tenancy in common basis, while the other two original joint co-owners continue to hold the remaining 2/3s on a joint tenancy basis. This result arises because the \\"unity of time\\" is broken: that is, because on the transfer the timing of the new interest is different from the original one. If it is desired to continue to maintain a joint tenancy, then the three original joint co-owners would need to transfer, in the one instrument, the joint interest to the two remaining joint co-owners and the new joint co-owner.\\r\\nA joint co-owner may break a joint tenancy and maintain an interest in the property. Most jurisdictions permit a joint owner to break a joint tenancy by the execution of a document to that effect. In those jurisdictions which retain the old common law requirements, an actual exchange with a straw man is required. This requires another person to \\"buy\\" the property from the joint co-owner for some nominal consideration, followed immediately by a sale-back to the co-owner at the same price. In either case, the joint tenancy will revert to a tenancy in common as to that owner's interest in the property.\\r\\nA significant issue can arise with the simple document execution method. In the straw man approach, there are witnesses to the transfer. With the document, there may not be witnesses. With either method, as soon as the break occurs, it works both ways. Because there may not be witnesses, the party with the document could take advantage of that fact and hide the document when the other party dies.\\r\\nIf one joint co-owner takes out a mortgage on jointly owned property, in some jurisdictions this may terminate the joint tenancy. Jurisdictions which use a title theory in this situation treat a mortgage as an actual conveyance of title until the mortgage is repaid, if not permanently. In such jurisdictions, the taking of a mortgage by one owner terminates the joint tenancy as to that co-owner. There are exceptions, and the law in the State of Georgia is a notable exception.\\r\\nIn Georgia, joint tenancy is commonly conveyed in a deed as \\"Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship\\". The legal effect of this type of tenancy is a \\"life estate\\" with a \\"contingent remainder\\". Translated, this means that the interest of each joint tenant can be thought of in two parts: the \\"present\\" interest while the parties are both alive and what happens in the \\"future\\" when one of the tenants dies. Viewed separately, the interest of each independent co-tenant is only \\"temporary\\" interest while they both co-tenants are alive and neither owns a \\"full\\" interest. The \\"full\\" interest is determined by who outlives the other and vests automatically in the survivor at, and only at, the time of death. In the case of a mortgage executed by only one of the living joint tenants, the mortgage does not sever the tenancy. Instead, the mortgage is interpreted as conveying whatever interest the debtor holds. In this example, that would be the debtor's life (or \\"temporary\\") estate only, since both parties are still living, but the lender would also be entitled to the full estate, but only if the debtor were to outlive the other joint-tenant. Consequently, if the debtor dies first, the co-tenant, who is not party to the mortgage, would take full ownership interest of the property free and clear of the mortgage. However, just because a surviving co-tenant isn't liable on the mortgage does not mean that the mortgage is extinguished or that the property is not subject to foreclosure if the mortgage isn't paid. The Georgia Supreme Court decision of Manders v. King, 284 Ga. 338, 339, 667 S.E.2d 59, 60 (2008) is instructive. \\"Georgia is one of several states adhering to the common-law doctrine of exoneration, which provides that, unless a will specifically provides otherwise, an heir or devisee of real property may look to the decedent's personal property for satisfaction of liens on devised real property, at the expense of the residuary legatees or distributees of the decedent's personal estate. J. Kraut, Annotation, Right of Heir or Devisee to Have Realty Exonerated from Lien Thereon at Expense of Personal Estate, 4 A.L.R.3d 1023,  3. See Raines v. Shipley, 197 Ga. 448, 458, 29 S.E.2d 588 (1944) ([U]nder the general law it was the duty of the executors to discharge this particular mortgage debt [on devised real property] from the personal property of the testatrix, if any she had....). See also Killingsworth v. First Nat. Bank of Columbus, 237 Ga. 544, 546, 228 S.E.2d 901 (1976) (estate required to exonerate devised real property by paying balance of mortgage liens so long as the liens were debts of the testator and not an assumption of debts of a predecessor in title). Id. In Manders, the Court held a surviving joint tenant does not qualify for exoneration of a mortgage on joint tenancy property unless there is language in the decedent's will clearly expressing an intention that the mortgage debt be paid. In re Estate of Young, supra; In re Estate of Dolley, supra, 265 Cal.App.2d at 72.2. In short, if there is a mortgage on a property that was executed by only one joint-tenant and that joint-tenant dies, unless there is a specific provision in the Will of the deceased joint-tenant that estate assets should be used to pay the outstanding mortgage, then surviving joint-tenant is not exonerated from the mortgage and the property is subject to foreclosure if the mortgage goes into default.\\r\\nIn sum, under Georgia law, execution of a mortgage (called a \\"Deed to Secure Debt\\" or \\"Security Deed\\") by one co-tenant does not sever the joint tenancy.\\r\\nHowever, in jurisdictions which use the lien theory, the mortgage merely places a lien on the property, leaving the joint tenancy undisturbed. As a lien is not enough to terminate a joint tenancy, if the debtor dies before the creditor sues, the creditor is left with no claim against the property, as the debtor's interest in the property evaporates and automatically vests in the other surviving co-owners.\\r\\nA co-owner of a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship deed may sever the joint tenancy by filing a petition to partition. A petition to partition is a legal right, so usually there is no way to stop such an action. When a court grants a partition action for a joint tenants with rights of survivorship deed, the property is either physically broken into parts and each owner is given a part of equal value OR the property is sold and the proceeds are distributed equally between the co-owners regardless of contribution to purchase price. No credits would be issued to any tenant who may have made a superior contribution toward purchase price.\\r\\nSome states allow a co-owner the option of buying out the other co-owners to avoid a public sale of the property. Some states also allow multiple co-owners to join their shares together to claim a majority ownership to avoid public sale of the property and to have the property awarded to the majority owners. If the property is sold publicly, the usual method is a public auction.\\r\\nDuring a partition process, credits may be granted to co-tenants who have paid property expenses in excess of their share, such as utilities and property maintenance. Credit may be given for improvements done to the property if the improvements have increased the value of the property. No credit would be given for excess contribution to purchase price, as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship deeds are taken in equal shares as a matter of law.\\r\\nPennsylvania partition case example: In DArcy v. Buckley, 71 Bucks Co. L. Rep. 167 (August 21, 1998), two persons purchased property as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The Plaintiff contributed five times more than the Defendant toward the purchase price. In a partition action, the Plaintiff sought credit for the full amount of his superior contributions. The Court held that, in the absence of fraud, the working of the deed operated to convey a one-half interest to each of the two joint tenants. The decision relies the authorities of Masgai v. Masgai, 460 Pa. 453, 333 A.2d 861 (1975) and DeLoatch v. Murphy, 369 Pa. Super. 255, 535 A.2d 146 (1987). The Plaintiff argued, to no avail, that he did not intend to make a lifetime gift to defendant.\\r\\nA tenancy by the entirety (sometimes called a tenancy by the entireties) is a type of concurrent estate formerly available only to married couples, where ownership of property is treated as though the couple were a single legal person. (In the State of Hawaii, the option of Tenants by the Entirety ownership is also available to domestic partners in a registered \\"Reciprocal Beneficiary Relationship\\"; Vermont's Civil Union statute qualifies parties to a civil union for tenancy by the entirety.) Like a Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship, the tenancy by the entirety also encompasses a right of survivorship, so if one spouse dies, the entire interest in the property is said to \\"ripen\\" in the survivor so that sole control of the property ripens, or passes in the ordinary sense, to the surviving spouse without going through probate.\\r\\nIn some jurisdictions, to create a tenancy by the entirety the parties must specify in the deed that the property is being conveyed to the couple \\"as tenants by the entirety,\\" while in others, a conveyance to a married couple is presumed to create a tenancy by the entirety unless the deed specifies otherwise.[5] (see also Sociedad de gananciales)[6] Also, besides sharing the four unities necessary to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship?ÿ  time, title, interest, and possession?ÿ  there must also be the fifth unity of marriage. However, unlike a JTWROS, neither party in a tenancy by the entirety has a unilateral right to sever the tenancy. The termination of the tenancy or any dealing with any part of the property requires the consent of both spouses. A divorce breaks the unity of marriage, leaving the default tenancy, which may be a tenancy in common in equal shares. Many US jurisdictions no longer recognize tenancies by the entirety.[7] Where it is recognized, benefits can include the ability to shield the property from creditors of only one spouse, as well as the ability to partially shield the property where only one spouse is filing a petition for bankruptcy relief. If a non-debtor spouse in a tenancy by the entirety survives a debtor spouse, the lien can never be enforced against the property. On the other hand, if a debtor spouse survives a non-debtor spouse, the lien may be enforced against the whole property, not merely the debtor spouse's original half-interest.\\r\\nIn many states, tenancy by the entireties is recognized as a valid form of ownership for bank accounts and financial assets. One must be careful to ensure that the tenancy by the entireties designation is chosen as opposed to other forms of joint ownership such as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, so that the benefits of tenancy by the entireties status is not lost. For example, under Florida law, if a bank account titling document allows for tenancy by the entireties and joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, if the account is opened as a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship account, the benefits of tenancy by entireties will not attach.\\r\\nKurtz, Hovenkamp.

Lowell Five Cents Savings Bank, 415 Mass. 145, 612 N.E. 2d 650.\\r\\nThere is nothing in the laws of Massachusetts, or New York as stated in Coraccio, to prevent one tenant by the entirety from conveying her own or his own interest in the property, subject to the continuing rights of the other. While it is generally believed that one tenant by the entirety cannot convey their interest because the tenancy cannot be severed, rather it is the survivorship rights of the other that cannot be severed. Thus, if a husband conveyed his interest in the property held as tenants by the entirety to his brother, the husband no longer owns an interest in the property. The brother takes his (the husband's) place within the tenancy. Here is the tricky part: if the wife dies then the husband's brother acquires all interest in the real estate. If the husband dies before the wife then it all goes to her free and clear and the husband's brother has nothing. Some conveyancers have treated deeds by one tenant by the entirety as null. However, such a deed conveys the interest of the grantor in the property subject to the survivorship rights of the other co-tenant.\\r\\nTenancy By the Entirety at Common Law/effect of a conveyance by one:","input":"What does joint tenancy mean in real estate?"},{"output":"savory, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and other herbs","context":"Herbes de Provence (French pronunciation:??[??b.d?.p??.v?s]) is a mixture of dried herbs typical of the Provence region of southeast France.

His small-world experiment while at Harvard led researchers to analyze the degree of connectedness, including the six degrees of separation concept. Later in his career, Milgram developed a technique for creating interactive hybrid social agents (cyranoids), which has since been used to explore aspects of social- and self-perception.\\r\\nHe is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of social psychology. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Milgram as the 46th-most-cited psychologist of the 20th century.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMilgram, who was Jewish,[6] was born in 1933 in the Bronx in New York City,[7] the son of Adele (ne Israel) and Samuel Milgram (1902ÿ1953), who had emigrated to the United States from Romania and Hungary respectively during World War I.[8][9][10][11] He was the second of three children.[12][3] Milgram's family was affected by the Holocaust, and after the war members of his family who had survived Nazi concentration camps, and bore concentration camp tattoos, stayed with his family for a time.[13]\\r\\nHis Bar Mitzvah speech was on the subject of the plight of the European Jews and the impact that World War II events would have on Jewish people around the world.[3][14][15] He said, upon becoming a man under Jewish law: \\"As I ... find happiness in joining the ranks of Israel, the knowledge of the tragic suffering of my fellow Jews ... makes this ... an occasion to reflect upon the heritage of my peoplewhich now becomes mine. ... I shall try to understand my people and do my best to share the responsibilities which history has placed upon all of us.\\"[15] He later wrote to a friend from childhood: \\"I should have been born into the German-speaking Jewish community of Prague in 1922 and died in a gas chamber some 20 years later. How I came to be born in the Bronx Hospital, I'll never quite understand.\\"[16] Milgram married his wife, Alexandra, in a ceremony at the Brotherhood Synagogue in Greenwich Village in Manhattan on December 10, 1961, and they had two children, Michele and Marc.[17]\\r\\nMilgram's interest in the Holocaust had its basis in what his biographer, Professor Thomas Blass, referred to as Milgram's \\"lifelong identification with the Jewish people\\".[18] Author Kirsten Fermaglich wrote that Milgram as an adult had \\"a personal conflict as a Jewish man who perceived himself both as an outsider, a victim of the Nazi destruction, and as an insider, as scientist\\".[19] Alexandra stated that Milgram's Jewish identity led to his focus on the Holocaust and his obedience-to-authority research.[19] He shared this as well with Herbert Winer, one of his obedience study subjects, who noted after speaking to Milgram about the experiment that \\"Milgram was very Jewish. I was Jewish. We talked about this. There was obviously a motive behind neutral research.\\"[19]\\r\\nMilgram's father worked as a baker, providing a modest income for his family until his death in 1953 (upon which Stanley's mother took over the bakery). Milgram attended PS 77 and James Monroe High School in the Bronx (which he graduated from in three years),[10][11] and excelled academically and was a great leader among his peers. By the time he was college age, his family had moved to nearby Queens.[14] In 1954, Milgram received his bachelor's degree in political science from Queens College in New York, which he attended tuition-free.[4] He also studied at Brooklyn College, where he received A-grades in \\"Psychology of Personality\\" and \\"An Eclectic Approach to Social Psychology\\".[6] He applied to a PhD program in social psychology at Harvard University, and was initially rejected due to an insufficient background in psychology (he had not taken any undergraduate courses in psychology at Queens College). He was eventually accepted to Harvard in 1954 after first enrolling as a student in Harvard's Office of Special Students.[4]\\r\\nIn 1961, Milgram received a PhD in social psychology from Harvard. He became an assistant professor at Yale in the fall of 1960. He served as an assistant professor in the Department of Social Relations at Harvard from 1963 to 1966 on a three-year contract. The contract was then extended for one additional year, but with the lower rank of a lecturer.[20] Most likely because of his controversial obedience experiment, Milgram was denied tenure at Harvard.\\r\\nIn 1967 he accepted an offer to become a tenured full professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center, and he taught at City University until he died in 1984.[4][21] Milgram had a number of significant influences, including psychologists Solomon Asch and Gordon Allport.[22]\\r\\nMilgram died on December 20, 1984, aged 51, of a heart attack in New York City. It was his fifth heart attack.[21] He left behind a widow, Alexandra \\"Sasha\\" Milgram, a daughter, Michele Sara, and a son, Marc Daniel.[23]\\r\\nIn 1963, Milgram submitted the results of his obedience experiments in the article \\"Behavioral Study of Obedience\\". In the ensuing controversy, the American Psychological Association held up his application for membership for a year because of questions about the ethics of his work, but eventually did grant him full membership. Ten years later, in 1974, Milgram published Obedience to Authority. He won the AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research in 1964, mostly for his work on the social aspects of obedience.[24] Inspired in part by the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann, his models were later also used to explain the 1968 My Lai Massacre (including authority training in the military, depersonalizing the \\"enemy\\" through racial and cultural differences, etc.). He produced a film depicting his experiments, which are considered classics of social psychology.\\r\\nAn article in American Psychologist [25] sums up Milgram's obedience experiments:\\r\\nIn Milgram's basic paradigm, a subject walks into a laboratory believing that s/he is about to take part in a study of memory and learning. After being assigned the role of a teacher, the subject is asked to teach word associations to a fellow subject (who in reality is a collaborator of the experimenter). The teaching method, however, is unconventionaladministering increasingly higher electric shocks to the learner. Once the presumed shock level reaches a certain point, the subject is thrown into a conflict. On the one hand, the strapped learner demands to be set free, he appears to suffer pain, and going all the way may pose a risk to his health. On the other hand, the experimenter, if asked, insists that the experiment is not as unhealthy as it appears to be, and that the teacher must go on. In sharp contrast to the expectations of professionals and laymen alike, some 65% of all subjects continue to administer shocks up to the very highest levels.\\r\\nMore recent tests of the experiment have found that it only works under certain conditions; in particular, when participants believe the results are necessary for the \\"good of science\\".[26]\\r\\nAccording to Milgram, \\"the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person's wishes, and he therefore no longer sees himself as responsible for his actions. Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person, all of the essential features of obedience follow.\\" Thus, \\"the major problem for the subject is to recapture control of his own regnant processes once he has committed them to the purposes of the experimenter.\\"[27] Besides this hypothetical agentic state, Milgram proposed the existence of other factors accounting for the subject's obedience: politeness, awkwardness of withdrawal, absorption in the technical aspects of the task, the tendency to attribute impersonal quality to forces that are essentially human, a belief that the experiment served a desirable end, the sequential nature of the action, and anxiety.\\r\\nA competing explanation[25] of Milgram's results invokes belief perseverance as the underlying factor. What \\"people cannot be counted on is to realize that a seemingly benevolent authority is in fact malevolent, even when they are faced with overwhelming evidence which suggests that this authority is indeed malevolent. Hence, the underlying cause for the subjects' striking conduct could well be conceptual, and not the alleged 'capacity of man to abandon his humanity . . . as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional structures.\\"'\\r\\nInspired by the horrific events of Nazi Germany, Milgram's obedience experiments have been used to explain a range of social influences on the individualincluding how police interrogators can get innocent people to confess to crimes they did not commit.[28] At the same time, these experiments have come under attack. Some critics questioned whether subjects sensed the unreality of the situation. Others questioned the relevance of the laboratory setting to the real world.\\r\\nThe most devastating criticisms involved the ethics of the basic experimental design. Professor Milgram, for his part, felt that such misgivings were traceable to the unsavory nature of his results: \\"Underlying the criticism of the experiment,\\" Milgram wrote, \\"is an alternative model of human nature, one holding that when confronted with a choice between hurting others and complying with authority, normal people reject authority.\\" [29]\\r\\nDaniel Raver looks back:\\r\\nEven though Milgrams personal interests were diverse, his greatest contribution to psychology came through one set of experiments, but in that set he contributed monumentally. He helped justify a science some dismiss as unimportant, contributed to the understanding of humanity, and, even if by way of attacks against him, contributed to the consideration of the treatment of research participants.\\r\\nThe six degrees of separation concept was examined in Milgram's 1967 \\"small world experiment\\", which tracked chains of acquaintances in the United States. In the experiment, Milgram sent several packages to 160 random people living in Omaha, Nebraska, asking them to forward the package to a friend or acquaintance who they thought would bring the package closer to a set final individual, a stockbroker from Boston, Massachusetts. Each \\"starter\\" received instructions to mail a folder via the U.S. Post Office to a recipient, but with some rules. Starters could only mail the folder to someone they actually knew personally on a first-name basis. When doing so, each starter instructed their recipient to mail the folder ahead to one of the latter's first-name acquaintances with the same instructions, with the hope that their acquaintance might by some chance know the target recipient.\\r\\nGiven that starters knew only the target recipient's name and address, they had a seemingly impossible task. Milgram monitored the progress of each chain via returned \\"tracer\\" postcards, which allowed him to track the progression of each letter. Surprisingly, he found that the very first folder reached the target in just four days and took only two intermediate acquaintances. Overall, Milgram reported that chains varied in length from two to ten intermediate acquaintances, with a median of five intermediate acquaintances (i.e. six degrees of separation) between the original sender and the destination recipient.\\r\\nMilgram's \\"six degrees\\" theory has been severely criticized. He did not follow up on many of the sent packages, and as a result, scientists are unconvinced that there are merely \\"six degrees\\" of separation.[30] Elizabeth DeVitaÿRaebu has discussed potential problems with Milgram's experiment.[31]\\r\\nIn 2008, a study by Microsoft showed that the average chain of contacts between users of its '.NET Messenger Service' (later called Microsoft Messenger service) was 6.6 people.[32]\\r\\nMilgram developed a technique, called the \\"lost letter\\" experiment, for measuring how helpful people are to strangers who are not present, and their attitudes toward various groups. Several sealed and stamped letters are planted in public places, addressed to various entities, such as individuals, favorable organizations like medical research institutes, and stigmatized organizations such as \\"Friends of the Nazi Party\\". Milgram found most of the letters addressed to individuals and favorable organizations were mailed, while most of those addressed to stigmatized organizations were not.[33][34]\\r\\nIn 1970ÿ71, Milgram conducted experiments which attempted to find a correlation between media consumption (in this case, watching television) and anti-social behavior. The experiment presented the opportunity to steal money, donate to charity, or neither, and tested whether the rate of each choice was influenced by watching similar actions in the ending of a specially crafted episode of the popular series Medical Center.[34]\\r\\nIn 1977 Milgram began piloting an experimental procedure that aimed to operationalize the mind-body fusion fantasy explored in the Edmond Rostand play Cyrano de Bergerac. In the story, Cyrano supplies Christian with amorous prose so that they may jointly woo Roxane (each being incapable, given their respective physical and linguistic limitations, of doing so on their own).\\r\\nMilgram trained speech shadowers to replicate in real-time spontaneous prose supplied by a remote \\"source\\" by-way-of discreet radio transmission during face-to-face dialogue with na?ve \\"interactants\\".[35] In homage to Cyrano, he referred to the hybrid agent formed by combining the words of one individual with the body of another as a \\"cyranoid\\". In his studies, interactants repeatedly failed to detect that their interlocutors were merely speech shadowing for third parties, implicitly and explicitly attributing to them communicative autonomy. Milgram referred to this phenomenon as the \\"cyranic illusion\\". This illusion held even in circumstances involving high disparity between shadower and source, such as when he sourced for child shadowers while being interviewed by panels of teachers (na?ve to the deception) tasked with assessing each child's intellectual abilities.\\r\\nMilgram hoped that the cyranoid method could evolve into a useful means of interactively exploring phenomena related to social behavior and self-perception (e.g., racial, gender, and age-based stereotyping and behavioral confirmation). Though he continued to develop the methodology through 1984 (the year of his death), he never prepared a formal publication detailing his cyranoid experiments.[36]\\r\\nIn 2014, social psychologists at the London School of Economics published the first replications of Milgram's original pilots.[37][38][39] Robb Mitchell has explored cyranoids as an experiential learning tool within the classroom (having children shadow for teachers during teaching exercises).[40] Cyranoids have also been used in installation art to explore social experiences whereby people encounter those familiar to them through the bodies of strangers.[41]\\r\\nIn 1975, CBS presented a made-for-television movie about obedience experiments, The Tenth Level, with William Shatner as Stephen Hunter, a Milgram-like scientist. Milgram was a consultant for the film, though his personal life did not resemble that of the Shatner character. In this film, incidents were portrayed that never occurred in the followup to the real-life experiment, including a subject's psychotic episode and the main character saying that he regretted the experiment. When asked about the film, Milgram told one of his graduate students, Sharon Presley, that he was not happy with the film and told her that he did not want his name to be used in the credits.\\r\\nIn 1979 French film director Henri Verneuil created a movie inspired both by the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and by Milgram's experience on submission to authority. In I as in Icarus (\\"I... comme Icare\\") a fictional country's prosecutor makes an investigation on the personality of the president's assassin, and discovers that the murderer has participated to an experiment similar to Milgram's. The experiment reveals a personality trait: far from wishing to break the law, the murderer has a strong respect for authority. It gives new leads for the prosecutor.\\r\\nIn 1986, musician Peter Gabriel wrote a song called \\"We do what we're told (Milgram's 37)\\", referring mistakenly to the percentage of test subjects who refused to continue administering shocks. Gabriel's intent was optimistic: not everyone was willing to obey authority and shock to the highest level. The actual percentage was 35. Quoted in an article in SPIN magazine in September, 1986:\\r\\nAt first this seems a very negative thing,\\" says Gabriel, \\"but I was comforted that some had the strength to rebel, and in the So version of the song, which Ive been performing in concert since around 1980, the emphasis is shifted to the positive side.[42]\\r\\nMilgram 18 was reproduced to test the participants in a 2008 television special The Heist.[43] Created by Derren Brown and Andy Nyman for British station Channel 4, the Milgram experiment helped determine which candidates were the most responsive to authority. The four most responsive and psychologically sound candidates at the end of the show were indirectly given the opportunity to rob a (fake) armoured bank van.\\r\\nIn April 2008, the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode \\"Authority\\" featured Robin Williams as a Milgram-like villain.\\r\\nIn March 2010, French television channel France 2 broadcast Jusqu'o va la tl, describing the results of a fake game show that they had run 80 times (each time independently, and with a new contestant and audience). The contestants received instructions to administer what they thought would be near fatal electric shocks to another \\"contestant\\" (really an actor) when that other contestant erred on memorized word-associations. Encouraged by the show's host and by an unprimed studio audience, the vast majority followed instructions even as the \\"victim\\" screamed.[44]\\r\\nIn 2010, luxury brand Enfants Perdus released a collection called \\"Milgram\\", in which the designers drew themes and inspiration from the Milgram experiment.[45] The design team has referenced the discussions about the human condition and the revelations of the human condition in numerous interviews.\\r\\nIn 2015, an experimental biopic about Milgram called Experimenter was released, directed by Michael Almereyda.

This was followed by Luna 20 and Luna 24 in 1972 and 1976, respectively. Following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first Lunokhod, Luna E-8 No.201, the Luna 17 and Luna 21 were successful unmanned lunar rover missions in 1970 and 1973.\\r\\nMany missions were failures at launch. In addition, several unmanned landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful, including: Luna 15, Luna 18, and Luna 23 all crashed on landing; and the U.S. Surveyor 4 lost all radio contact only moments before its landing.\\r\\nMore recently, other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the Moon at speeds of around 8,000 kilometres per hour (5,000?mph), often at precise, planned locations. These have generally been end-of-life lunar orbiters that, because of system degradations, could no longer overcome perturbations from lunar mass concentrations (\\"masscons\\") to maintain their orbit. Japan's lunar orbiter Hiten impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The European Space Agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter SMART-1 on 3 September 2006.\\r\\nIndian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indian Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter and performed remote sensing experiments during its descent to the lunar surface.\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1 executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission Chang'e 3 was launched on 1 December 2013 and soft-landed on 14 December.\\r\\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting on 20 July 1969 UTC, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 UTC with Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface.\\r\\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the Command Module. The last three missions had a rover for increased mobility.\\r\\nIn order to go to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave the gravity well of the Earth. The only practical way of accomplishing this currently is with a rocket. Unlike other airborne vehicles such as balloons or jets, a rocket is the only known form of propulsion which can continue to increase its speed at high altitudes in the vacuum outside the Earth's atmosphere.\\r\\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about 160 kilometres per hour (99?mph) and be ruggedized to withstand a \\"hard landing\\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \\"soft landing\\" (which is the only viable option with human occupants). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in 1962 all failed.[5] The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first unmanned soft lunar landing by the U.S.\\r\\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the escape velocity of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is 2.38 kilometres per second (1.48?mi/s).[6] The change in velocity (referred to as a delta-v) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original launch vehicle as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on Titan carried out by the Huygens probe in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using atmospheric entry techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\\r\\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.[7] Crash landings[8] may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been many such moon crashes, often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V moon rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the lunar module were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the Moon.\\r\\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing.[citation needed] These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\\r\\nThe intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an unmanned and then ultimately a manned moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. World War II had introduced many new and deadly innovations including blitzkrieg-style surprise attacks used in the invasion of Poland and in the attack on Pearl Harbor; the V-2 rocket, a ballistic missile which killed thousands in attacks on London and Antwerp; and the atom bomb, which killed hundreds of thousands in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the hydrogen bomb.\\r\\nWilly Ley wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \\"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\\".[9] On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 as the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and so initiated the Space Race. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.[citation needed] Also, the steady beeping of the radio beacon aboard Sputnik 1 as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides[citation needed] as effective propaganda to Third World countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet political system compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a solar orbit, the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon and the first photography of the never-before-seen far side of the Moon. These were the Luna 1, Luna 2 and Luna 3 spacecraft.\\r\\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, NASA. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that would bridge the so-called missile gap and enable a policy of deterrence to nuclear war with the Soviets known as mutual assured destruction or MAD. These newly developed missiles were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\\r\\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,[citation needed] just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \\"Luna\\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \\"Sputnik\\" or \\"Cosmos\\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\\r\\nIn contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in 1959, success eluded initial U.S. efforts to reach the Moon with the Pioneer and Ranger programs. Fifteen consecutive U.S. unmanned lunar missions over a six-year period from 1958 to 1964 all failed their primary photographic missions;[10][11] however, Rangers 4 and 6 successfully repeated the Soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions.[12][13]\\r\\nFailures included three U.S. attempts[5][12][14] in 1962 to hard land small seismometer packages released by the main Ranger spacecraft. These surface packages were to use retrorockets to survive landing, unlike the parent vehicle, which was designed to deliberately crash onto the surface. The final three Ranger probes performed successful high altitude lunar reconnaissance photography missions during intentional crash impacts between 2.62 and 2.68 kilometres per second (9,400 and 9,600?km/h).[15][16][17]\\r\\nThree different designs of Pioneer lunar probes were flown on three different modified ICBMs. Those flown on the Thor booster modified with an Able upper stage carried an infrared image scanning television system with a resolution of 1 milliradian to study the Moon's surface, an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites, a magnetometer, and temperature-variable resistors to monitor spacecraft internal thermal conditions. The first, a mission managed by the United States Air Force, exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and 1,450 kilometres (900?mi), far short of the roughly 400,000 kilometres (250,000?mi) required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\\r\\nNASA then collaborated with the United States Army's Ballistic Missile Agency to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the Juno ICBM, carrying only photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger-Mller tube detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around 100,000 kilometres (62,000?mi), serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the Van Allen radiation belts before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi), twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a solar orbit.\\r\\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \\"paddlewheel\\" solar panels extending from a one-meter diameter spherical spin-stabilized spacecraft body that was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure magnetic fields, detect low frequency electromagnetic waves in space and use a sophisticated integrated propulsion system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its Atlas ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\\r\\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory embarked upon an unmanned spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as Mariners; lunar versions were Rangers. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\\r\\nThe Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical.[18][19] Spacecraft experiments included a Lyman-alpha telescope, a rubidium-vapor magnetometer, electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range particle detectors, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating ionization chamber, cosmic dust detectors, and scintillation counters. The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and a perigee of 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi).[18]\\r\\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the magnetosphere over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth parking orbit after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\\r\\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.[5][12][14] All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1?m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650?mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of 5,050 pounds-force (22.5?kN),[12] and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5?m in diameter. This lander (code-named Tonto) was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid freon. A 42?kg (56 pounds) 30-centimetre-diameter (0.98?ft) metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere[citation needed].\\r\\nThis payload sphere contained six silver-cadmium batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer that was designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a 5?lb (2.3?kg) meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\\r\\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the 3.1 metres (10?ft) Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.[12] Seconds before impact, at 5 and 0.6 kilometres (3.11 and 0.37?mi) above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed here).\\r\\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at 330 metres (1,080?ft) above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface[citation needed].\\r\\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior heat sterilization of the spacecraft by keeping it above the boiling point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.[citation needed]\\r\\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.[citation needed] These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo manned Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While Ranger 6 suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent Ranger 7 mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\\r\\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the Ranger 7 mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the United States Congress intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo manned Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with Ranger 8 and Ranger 9 further buoyed U.S. hopes.\\r\\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February. Airbags protected its 99 kilograms (218?lb) ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second (54?km/h).[20] Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.[21]\\r\\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.[22] It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\\r\\nIn 1970 and 1973 two Lunokhod (\\"Moonwalker\\") robotic lunar rovers were delivered to the Moon, where they successfully operated for 10 and 4 months respectively, covering 10.5?km (Lunokhod 1) and 37?km (Lunokhod 2). These rover missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions.\\r\\nThe U.S. robotic Surveyor program was part of an effort to locate a safe site on the Moon for a human landing and test under lunar conditions the radar and landing systems required to make a true controlled touchdown. Five of Surveyor's seven missions made successful unmanned Moon landings. Surveyor 3 was visited two years after its Moon landing by the crew of Apollo 12. They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.\\r\\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with unmanned spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming manned landers with their much greater weight.\\r\\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a 50 kilometres (31?mi)-per-hour ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned 160 kilometres (99?mi)-per-hour impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a manned flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\\r\\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before manned spacecraft could follow unmanned ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all utilized flight paths from Earth that traveled directly to the lunar surface without first placing the spacecraft in a lunar orbit. Such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for unmanned spacecraft on a one-way trip.\\r\\nIn contrast, manned vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile for a manned Moon landing.\\r\\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions which featured lunar orbit operations as a necessary prerequisite to a manned Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial unmanned orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of manned landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\\r\\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's maria. Such mass concentrations (\\"mascons\\") can send a manned mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\\r\\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA Lunar Prospector orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume that would be detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist Eugene Shoemaker was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor ÿ currently the only human remains on the Moon.\\r\\nLuna 10 became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\\r\\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so that it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called free return trajectory. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a manned circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges above and beyond those found in a manned low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a manned Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\\r\\nManned Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around 17,000 miles per hour (27,000?km/h; 7,600?m/s). Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around 25,000 miles per hour (40,000?km/h; 11,000?m/s). The g-loading on astronauts during the resulting deceleration can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\\r\\nAchieving a manned circumlunar loop flight prior to a manned lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their Zond spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were unmanned planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate manned program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a manned circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\\r\\nInitial manned spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet Vostok and U.S. Mercury programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as Voskhod effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten Gemini low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove critical techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking that were crucial to a manned lunar landing mission profile.\\r\\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviets Union began flying their second-generation Zond manned spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him immediately to Earth. The Zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational Proton launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet manned Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation Soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced N-1 booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a manned Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. manned lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\\r\\nLike Zond, Apollo Moon flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop in the event that a Service Module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit as planned. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which is the only manned circumlunar loop mission flown to date.\\r\\nZond 5 was the first spacecraft to carry life from Earth to the vicinity of the Moon and return, initiating the final lap of the Space Race with its payload of turtles, insects, plants and bacteria. Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both of these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to human crewmembers had they been aboard.\\r\\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue unmanned Zond tests until their reliability to support manned flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the lunar module, and because of CIA reports of a potential Soviet manned circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of Apollo 8 from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\\r\\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in Baikonur, giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. Cosmonauts went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first manned trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet Politburo decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a manned Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another unmanned test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\\r\\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. Apollo spacecraft had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The Apollo 8 mission carried out the first manned trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the Saturn V booster for manned use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. Apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a manned Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within 47,400 feet (14.4?km) altitude above the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module that was too overweight to allow a successful landing. With the failure of the unmanned Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna 15 in July 1969, the stage was set for Apollo 11.\\r\\nPlans for manned Moon exploration originated during the Eisenhower administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in Collier's magazine, Wernher von Braun had popularized the idea of a manned expedition to the Moon to establish a lunar base. A manned Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, atmospheric re-entry without ablative overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, von Braun promoted a plan for the United States Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\\r\\nAfter the early Soviet successes, especially Yuri Gagarin's flight, US President John F. Kennedy looked for a US project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President Lyndon Johnson to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the Third World. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the United States, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\\r\\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads, and consequently, rockets with smaller payload capacities. By comparison, Soviet nuclear weapons were much heavier, and the powerful R-7 rocket was developed to carry them. More modest potential missions such as flying around the Moon without landing or establishing a space lab in orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun) were determined to offer too much advantage to the Soviets, since the US would have to develop a heavy rocket to match the Soviets. A Moon landing, however, would capture world imagination while functioning as propaganda.\\r\\nJohnson had championed the US manned space program ever since the Sputnik scare, sponsoring the legislation which created NASA when he was in the Senate in 1958. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best manned space achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating the USSR to a manned lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. This last dismayed NASA's leader, James E. Webb, who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\\r\\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V launch vehicle, which achieved a perfect record of zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures, in thirteen launches.\\r\\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians on the left, who wanted more money spent on social programs, and on those on the right, who favored a more military project. By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson became President in 1963, his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy planned.\\r\\nSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said in October 1963 that the USSR was \\"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\\r\\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. Sergey Korolev, the Soviet space program's chief designer, had started promoting his Soyuz craft and the N1 launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a manned Moon landing.\\r\\nKhrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a manned cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all manned projects under his direction.\\r\\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, the co-ordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for the mission that would have placed Aleksei Leonov on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a manned landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\\r\\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of manned Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.[23]\\r\\nUnlike other international rivalries, the Space Race has remained unaffected in a direct way regarding the desire for territorial expansion. After the successful landings on the Moon, the U.S. explicitly disclaimed the right to ownership of any part of the Moon.\\r\\nPresident Richard Nixon had speechwriter William Safire prepare a condolence speech for delivery in the event that Armstrong and Aldrin became marooned on the Moon's surface and could not be rescued.[24]\\r\\nIn 1951, science fiction writer Arthur C.

Some news outlets have mistakenly reported that the SSTV tapes were found in Western Australia, but those tapes were only recordings of data from the Apollo 11 Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package.[26]\\r\\nScientists believe the six American flags planted by astronauts have been bleached white because of more than 40 years of exposure to solar radiation.[27] Using LROC images, five of the six American flags are still standing and casting shadows at all of the sites, except Apollo 11.[28] Astronaut Buzz Aldrin reported that the flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during liftoff of Apollo 11.[28]\\r\\nLaunched on 24 January 1990, 11:46 UTC. At the end of its mission, the Japanese lunar orbiter Hiten was commanded to crash into the lunar surface and did so on 10 April 1993 at 18:03:25.7 UT (11 April 03:03:25.7 JST).[29]\\r\\nLunar Prospector was launched on 7 January 1998. The mission ended on 31 July 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a crater near the lunar south pole after the presence of water ice was successfully detected.[30]\\r\\nLaunched 27 September 2003, 23:14 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. At the end of its mission, the ESA lunar orbiter SMART-1 performed a controlled crash into the Moon, at about 2?km/s. The time of the crash was 3 September 2006, at 5:42 UTC.[31]\\r\\nSELENE or Kaguya was launched on 14 September 2007. After successfully orbiting the Moon for a year and eight months, the main orbiter was instructed to impact on the lunar surface near the crater Gill at 18:25 UTC on 10 June 2009.[32]\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1, launched 24 October 2007, 10:05 UTC, executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009, 20:44 GMT, after a 16-month mission.[33]\\r\\nChandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008, 00:52 UTC. The impactor, the Moon Impact Probe, impacted near Shackleton Crater at the south pole of the lunar surface at 14 November 2008, 20:31 IST.[34] Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled for launch in 2018.\\r\\nThe LCROSS data collecting shepherding spacecraft was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on 18 June 2009 on board an Atlas V rocket with a Centaur upper stage. On 9 October 2009, at 11:31 UTC, the Centaur upper stage impacted the lunar surface, releasing the kinetic energy equivalent of detonating approximately 2 tons of TNT (8.86 GJ).[35] Six minutes later at 11:37 UTC, the LCROSS shepherding spacecraft also impacted the surface.[36]\\r\\nThe GRAIL mission consisted of two small spacecraft: GRAIL A (Ebb), and GRAIL B (Flow). They were launched on 10 September 2011 on board a Delta II rocket. GRAIL A separated from the rocket about nine minutes after launch, and GRAIL B followed about eight minutes later.[37][38] The first probe entered orbit on 31 December 2011 and the second followed on 1 January 2012.[39] The two spacecraft impacted the Lunar surface on 17 December 2012.[40]\\r\\nLADEE was launched on 7 September 2013.[41] The mission ended on 18 April 2014, when the spacecraft's controllers intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon,[42][43] which, later, was determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.[44][45]\\r\\nOn 14 December 2013 at 13:12 UTC[46] Chang'e 3 soft-landed a rover on the Moon. This was the first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 on 22 August 1976.[47]\\r\\nProgress in space exploration has recently broadened the phrase moon landing to include other moons in the Solar System as well. The Huygens probe of the CassiniÿHuygens mission to Saturn performed a successful unmanned moon landing on Titan in 2005. Similarly, the Soviet probe Phobos 2 came within 120?mi (190?km) of performing an unmanned moon landing on Mars' moon Phobos in 1989 before radio contact with that lander was suddenly lost. A similar Russian sample return mission called Fobos-Grunt (\\"grunt\\" means \\"soil\\" in Russian) launched in November 2011, but stalled in low Earth orbit. There is widespread interest in performing a future moon landing on Jupiter's Europa moon to drill down and explore the possible liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface.\\r\\nChina is planning to land another rover and collect samples in the Chang'e 4 mission and return lunar soil samples by 2018 in the Chang'e 5 mission.[48]\\r\\nISRO, the Indian National Space agency, is planning a second version of Chandrayaan named Chandrayaan 2. According to former ISRO Chairman G. Madhavan Nair, \\"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) hopes to land two rovers ÿ one Indian and another Russian ÿ on the Moon in 2018, as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission. The rover will be designed to move on wheels on the lunar surface, pick up samples of soil or rocks, do on-site chemical analysis and send the data to the mother-spacecraft Chandrayaan II, which will be orbiting above. Chandrayaan II will transmit the data to Earth.\\" The payloads have already been finalized.[49][50] ISRO has mentioned that due to weight restrictions it will not be carrying any overseas payloads on this mission. The lander weight is projected to be 1,250?kg, and the spacecraft will be launched by the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.\\r\\nRussia's Luna-Glob 1 is expected to be launched in 2018.[51] In 2007 the head of the Russian Space Agency announced plans to send cosmonauts to the Moon by 2025 and establish a permanent robotically operated base there in 2027ÿ2032.[52] In 2015, Roscosmos stated that Russia plans to place a cosmonaut on the Moon by 2030, leaving Mars to NASA. The purpose is to work jointly with NASA and avoid another Space Race.[53]\\r\\nThe Lunar Precursor Robotic Program (LPRP) is a program of robotic spacecraft missions which NASA will use to prepare for future Moon landings.[54] Three orbiters have been launched in the program, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), and the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), launched in 2013, but no Moon landings are scheduled yet.\\r\\nThe Google Lunar X Prize competition offers a $20?million award for the first privately funded team to land a robotic probe on the Moon. Like the Ansari X Prize before it, the competition aims to advance the state of the art in private space exploration.[55] Of the several competing teams, Puli Space Technologies at one time (2012) planned to launch in 2014[56][needs update] and Astrobotic Technology plans to launch in the second half of 2016 with their own rover plus another team's lunar rovers from Hakuto.[57][58]\\r\\nMany conspiracy theorists hold that the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax;[59] however, empirical evidence is readily available to show that manned moon landings did indeed occur. Anyone on Earth with an appropriate laser and telescope system can bounce laser beams off three retroreflector arrays left on the Moon by Apollo 11,[60] 14 and 15, verifying deployment of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment at historically documented Apollo Moon landing sites and so proving equipment constructed on Earth was successfully transported to the surface of the Moon. In addition, in August 2009 NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter began to send back high resolution photos of the Apollo landing sites. These photos show not only the large Descent Stages of the lunar landers left behind but also tracks of the astronauts' walking paths in the lunar dust.[61]","input":"When did humans first land on the moon?"},{"output":"infantry and cavalry soldiers charged with guarding the official royal residences in the United Kingdom","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen's Guard and Queen's Life Guard  (called King's Guard and King's Life Guard when the reigning monarch is male) are the names given to contingents of infantry and cavalry soldiers charged with guarding the official royal residences in the United Kingdom. The British Army has regiments of both Horse Guards and Foot Guards predating the English Restoration (1660), and since the reign of King Charles II these regiments have been responsible for guarding the Sovereign's palaces. They are not purely ceremonial, despite tourist perceptions. The Queen's Guards are fully operational soldiers.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen's Guard and Queen's Life Guard are mounted at the royal residences that come under the operating area of the British Army's London District, which is responsible for the administration of the Household Division. This covers Buckingham Palace, St James's Palace and the Tower of London, as well as Windsor Castle. The Queen's Guard is also mounted at the sovereign's other official residence, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, but not as often as in London. In Edinburgh, the guard is the responsibility of the resident infantry battalion at Redford Barracks. It is not mounted at the Queen's private residences at Sandringham or Balmoral.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen's Guard is the name given to the contingent of infantry responsible for guarding Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace (including Clarence House) in London. The guard is made up of a company of soldiers from a single regiment, which is split in two, providing a detachment for Buckingham Palace and a detachment for St James's Palace. Because the Sovereign's official residence is still St James's, the guard commander (called the 'Captain of the Guard') is based there, as are the regiment's colours. When the Sovereign is in residence, the Queen's Guard numbers three officers and 40 other ranks, with four sentries each posted at Buckingham Palace (on the forecourt) and St James's Palace (two in Friary Court, two at the entrance to Clarence House). This reduces to three officers and 31 ORs, with two sentries each when the Sovereign is not in residence.[2] The Queen's Guard is not purely ceremonial in nature. They provide sentries during the day and night, and during the later hours, they patrol the grounds of the Palace. Until 1959, the sentries at Buckingham Palace were stationed outside the fence. This stopped following an incident involving a female tourist and a Coldstream Guardsman ÿ due to the continued pestering by tourists and sightseers, the guardsman kicked the tourist on the ankle as he marched. The tourist made a complaint to the police and, despite sympathy, the sentry was confined to barracks for ten days. Not long after, the sentries were moved inside the fence.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any time, three infantry battalions are posted for public duties; two of these are Guards battalions (one based at Wellington Barracks next to Buckingham Palace and one at Victoria Barracks in Windsor), while the third is a line infantry unit (based at Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich). In addition, there are three incremental companies based at Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich and Wellington Barracks. All of these units come under the administrative authority of London Districtas public duties units, they not only take part in ceremonial but are also committed to providing military aid to the civilian authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guard is usually found from one of the five regiments of foot guards:\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in theory, any Commonwealth unit can provide the guard. On many occasions, the Gurkhas, RAF Regiment and Royal Marines have provided the guard, while a handful of units from other Commonwealth countries have also done so (see below). Only one unit has come from a Commonwealth country of which the Queen is not head of state, namely the 1st Battalion Royal Malay Regiment in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of units of the Gurkhas and Royal Marines to have mounted the Queen's Guard since the Second World War[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe RAF Regiment has a dedicated ceremonial unit, the Queen's Colour Squadron; this unit represents the RAF whenever it provides the Queen's Guard.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2017, the Royal Navy mounted the guard with a company sized detachment formed of volunteers from 45 ships and store establishments[6] for two weeks, the first time that the Senior Service had formed the Queen's Guard in its own right (rather than being represented by the Royal Marines).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to Options for Change, because there were a total of eight guards battalions, it was rare for battalions of line infantry to mount the Queen's Guard and, as such, was a significant honour. Before 1996, only two battalions had served on public duties as part of an operational tour in London District.[8] However, when the 2nd Battalions of the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards and Scots Guards were put in suspended animation, a decision to replace one of the three Foot Guard battalions then engaged on public duties by a line infantry battalion was taken, so as to enable the Foot Guards battalion to increase the proportion of its effort employed on training for operational roles. From 1996 to 2013, a line infantry battalion was stationed in London (first at Hounslow, then Woolwich) under the command of London District:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2013 regular public duties responsibility has reverted to the Household Division.[11] However, line infantry units occasionally provide the Guard for short periods of time. In the summer of 2018, Balaklava Company, the dedicated public duties unit of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, and 2nd Battalion, The Rifles both provided the Guard at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1938 the Honourable Artillery Company, a Territorial Army unit, provided the King's Guard. The same Regiment subsequently provided the Queen's Guard in 1958, during the 1990s the Band of the Honourable Artillery Company provided musical support for the Queen's Guard and they continue to do so in the 21st century.[14] In June 2015 soldiers from the 3rd Battalion The Royal Welsh provided the Tower of London detachment of the Queen's Guard.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 May 1941, the Home Guard provided the King's Guard, in recognition of the first anniversary of its foundation.[15] This was repeated in May 1943.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two detachments of the Queen's Guard in London, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard. Because St James's Palace is still the official residence of the Court, it is here that the Colour is lodged and the Captain of the Guard establishes his headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen's Guard in London changes in the Forecourt of Buckingham Palace at 11:00 am every day in the summer and four times per week in the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe St James's Palace detachment of the Queen's Guard, led usually by the Corps of Drums, and bearing the Colour (if the Queen is in residence, then this will be the Queen's Colour; if she is not, then it is the Regimental Colour), marches along the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where the Buckingham Palace detachment has formed up to await their arrival. These two detachments are the Old Guard. Meanwhile, the New Guard is forming up and are awaiting inspection by the Adjutant on the parade square at Wellington Barracks. The Band, having been inspected by the Adjutant, forms a circle to play music whilst the New Guard is inspected. The Guard provides a full Military Band consisting of no fewer than 35 musicians (usually, though not always, from one of the Guards regiments) accompanied by their Director of Music. When the New Guard is formed up, led by the Band, it marches across into the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. Once there, the New Guard advances towards the Old Guard in slow time and halts. The Old Guard presents arms, followed by the New Guard presenting arms. The Captains of the Guards march towards each other for the handing over of the Palace keys. The new reliefs are marched to the guardrooms of Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace where new sentries are posted.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time the Band has taken its place by the centre gate, formed up in a half-circle, where it plays music to entertain the New and Old Guard as well as the watching crowds. During this period, the two regimental colours are paraded up and down by the Ensigns (usually junior officers of 2nd Lieutenant rank or equivalent). With the Old and New Guards formed up once again, the Old Guard and the Band march out through the centre gates in slow time to their Regimental Slow march played by the Band. At the end of the slow march, the Captain of the Old Guard gives the word of command to 'Break into Quick Time' and with a brisk five pace roll from the drums, the Band leads the way back to Wellington Barracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nA detachment of the regiment on guard at Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace is also responsible for providing the guard at the Tower of London. As the Tower is still officially a royal residence and is also the location of the crown jewels, it remains the army's obligation to guard it. The Tower guard numbers one officer, 3 NCOs and 10 soldiers, and usually posts a sentry outside the Jewel House and one outside the Queen's House. As the protection of the Tower is their responsibility (in conjunction with the Yeoman Warders), the guard must also see it is secure at night (see Ceremony of the Keys).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the public duties battalions or incremental companies is responsible for providing the guard at Windsor Castle. The location of the ceremony at Windsor varies; in the Easter, when the Queen is in residence it usually takes place on the lawn in the Castle's quadrangle. In wet weather or winter to protect the lawn, or when the Queen is not holding court at Windsor Castle, the ceremony occurs outside the Guardroom by Henry VIII's Gateway at the foot of Castle Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ceremony for changing the Windsor Guard is broadly the same as that which takes place at Buckingham Palace. At 10.40am, the New Guard marches from Victoria Barracks, through Windsor and turn left going up Castle Hill to enter the Lower Ward. During the Easter, and when Her Majesty is holding court at the Castle, the guards change in the Upper Ward on the grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen changing guard in the normal way, the new guard arrives at roughly 11 am when the old guard has formed up outside the guardroom. Once both guards and the duty band (there is no duty band on Sundays) are present, the old guard and new guard will present arms to each other, interspersed by bugle calls ÿ the officers will then go towards each other and symbolically touch left hands to 'hand over the keys to the castle' (though no actual keys are handed over anymore). The guards will then slope arms and the reliefs will be formed up to go round the castle and change the sentries ÿ during this process, the band typically plays a selection of music. Once the relief returns, the old guard forms back up ready to march back to Victoria Barracks. The band leads them out whilst the new guard presents arms. Once the old guard has left, the new guard is dismissed to the guardroom where they will be based for the next 24/48 hours ÿ every two hours, the guard relief will march out and change the sentries.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Gordon Riots in 1780 a detachment of the Foot Guards successfully defended the Bank of England from a violent mob.  Thenceforth the Bank paid for a detachment of soldiers, usually provided by the Brigade of Guards, to defend the Bank.[18] From 1780, the detachment marched from their barracks, initially from the Tower of London, later Wellington or Chelsea Barracks, though in bad weather the detachment would be sent by a normal train of the London Underground.[19][clarification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a Guard Mount at 3?pm, each guard consisted of one officer, one sergeant, one corporal, one lance corporal, eight guardsmen and a drummer; originally the guard had 30 guardsmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce at the Bank there were two sentry posts, one outside the Counting House Parlour and another outside the bullion vaults.[20] The officer was given half a bottle of port and the right to invite a friend or two to dinner in the bank.  The other ranks were given a pint of beer with their dinner and one brand new shilling, two for a sergeant,  that they bought tea and a cake with in the Canteen.  The Guard wore plimsolls in the Bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1963, the Bank Picquet travelled by vehicle clad in service dress and armed with automatic weapons, with the emphasis on security moving from ceremonial to tactical deployment. Improved security features and armed police made the guard unnecessary, and the service ended on the evening of 31 July 1973.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Guard is also mounted in Edinburgh at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the Queen's official residence in Scotland, and at Edinburgh Castle. Unlike in London, there is no Guards battalion permanently based in the city, so the guard is provided by whichever the resident infantry battalion is at Redford Barracks in the city. The guard is not mounted throughout the year ÿ it is usually mounted daily during the week that the Queen spends at the palace (prior to her summer break at Balmoral), and during the Lord Commissioner's Week. Until 2001\\r\\n, sentries were permanently posted on the Esplanade at the entrance of the castle, ostensibly as the guards to the Honours of Scotland housed inside. The sentries were changed every hour. However, cutbacks in the size of the army led to the permanent castle guard being abolished ÿ now, the guard is mounted at the same time as the guard at the Palace, or when there is a royal visitor to Edinburgh. Sentries are also posted during the month of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, usually from a unit that has an anniversary from the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the reorganisation of the infantry following the 2003 defence review, the 1st and 2nd Battalions, Royal Regiment of Scotland (the Royal Scots Borderers and Royal Highland Fusiliers) will be permanently based in Edinburgh, rotating between 19 Light Brigade or 52 Infantry Brigade. Whichever battalion is assigned to 52 Brigade would then be responsible for performing public duties in Edinburgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the 2010 defence review, announcements of further reforms to the infantry led to the reduction of the 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland to an incremental company, similar to the three companies of foot guards stationed in London, which will be a public duties unit permanently based in Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen's Guard is an operational posting, with the primary purpose of protecting the Sovereign. However, there have been a handful of incidents over the years when this protection has been tested; in 1982, a man named Michael Fagan was able to evade the sentries stationed in the grounds of Buckingham Palace and make his way to the Queen's bedroom, before he was captured by police. In this instance, security of the Queen's room was the task of the Metropolitan Police. In 2004, a member of the pressure group Fathers4Justice spent five and a half hours standing on the parapet by the balcony at the front of Buckingham Palace. Again, the security was the primary responsibility of the Metropolitan Police; although the Queen was not present at the time, it raised fears of the possibility of a terrorist attack on the palace, and gave rise to calls for the British Army to be given a greater hand in the overall security of the Royal Family.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sentry will be on duty \\"at their post\\" for a two-hour period. Every 10 minutes, he comes to attention, slopes arms and does a march of 15 paces across the area of the post. Each sentry will do this four to five times before halting. He will then shoulder arms and stand at ease. Standing \\"easy\\" is not permitted whilst a sentry is at post. Orders for sentry duty read out before each 2 hour 'tour of duty', make it clear to each individual that: \\"you may not eat, sleep, smoke, stand easy, sit or lie down during your tour of duty\\".[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nSentries receive instruction on how to eliminate nuisance or any suggestion of threat from members of the public. There is a protocol they follow which begins with \\"stamping\\" (coming to attention sharply). He will also shout: \\"Stand back from the Queen's Guard\\" or similar. If this does not eliminate the nuisance or threat he will repeat the stamp and shout again. If the nuisance or threat still does not cease the sentry will assume the position of \\"port arms\\" whereby he points his rifle at the source of the interference with his duties. If these warnings are not heeded the sentry then has the choice of detaining the person(s) himself or pressing the button in his sentry box to summon assistance.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a person or persons step in front of a sentry while he is marching he will shout: \\"Make way for the Queen's Guard!\\" (Or Castle guard/Tower of London guard/Windsor Castle guard etc.)[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile The Foot Guards are also fully operational soldiers, part of their duties is guarding The Queen and her residences. The duty of mounting 'Queen's Guard' as it is known within the Army is one which many also take on with great pride. The guards remain a fully functional part of royal defences though through the years they have become a tourist attraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough formerly the guards were able to be positioned among the public, in recent times, more and more of the sentry posts have been moved away from the public because of incidents involving tourists interfering with the guards' job. Most recently, ropes were installed between the sentry posts at Windsor Castle and the public after an incident occurred between a sentry and a tourist who was mocking him, pretending to march alongside him and eventually grabbing the shoulder on which his rifle was resting.[24][25] In London, the only open sentry posts remaining not usually behind any sort of fence were those at the Pall Mall entrance to St James's Palace (although when the Prince of Wales took up residence at Clarence House, the sentries were moved outside the gate); however, in December 2014, the Pall Mall sentries were moved to Friary Court inside the walls of the palace, while the Clarence House sentries repositioned inside the fence and at the entrance to the gardens. This was as a result of the increased threat of so-called \\"lone wolf\\" terrorist attacks, particularly following the murder of a British soldier in Woolwich, and the terrorist attack on the Canadian Parliament.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nBattalions on public duties were part of the regular arms plot, a system where infantry battalions were periodically rotated to various locations and different roles. Following the restructuring of the army announced in 2006, the arms plot system ceased ÿ infantry battalions have now been given fixed roles and locations. In theory, this includes public duties in London, which will retain its two guards and one line infantry battalion. However, for some postings, including public duties, light role infantry battalions will continue to rotate. In the case of public duties in London, the four Guards battalions will rotate every two years, while the line infantry battalion will rotate with battalions assigned to 52 Infantry Brigade and British Forces Cyprus. This has changed following the implementation of the Army 2020 plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2007, the first serving women in the British Army served on detachments of the Queen's Guard when the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery took over the guard at Windsor Castle, while the Army Air Corps took on public duties in London.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not the first occasion that women have provided the Queen's Guard. In 2000, the Australian Federation Guard performed public duties in London for a month and included several women amongst its number.[29] Female officers were also among the contingent of Royal Canadian Mounted Police members who formed the guard in May 2012.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first female Captain of the Queen's Guard was 24-yr old Captain Megan Couto of the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry as they formed the Queen's Guard in June 2017 in celebration of Canada 150.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of units from the British Empire and Commonwealth to have mounted the King's Guard/Queen's Guard.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen's Life Guard is the mounted guard at the entrance to Horse Guards. Horse Guards is the official main entrance to both St James's Palace and Buckingham Palace (a tradition that stems from the time when The Mall was closed at both ends); however, sentries have been posted there since the Restoration, when the Palace of Whitehall was the main royal residence. The guard is on horseback from 10 am until 4 pm, with the two sentries changing every hour. From 4 pm until 8 pm a pair of dismounted sentries remain. At 8 pm, the gates of Horse Guards are locked, and a single sentry remains until 7 am.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen The Queen is in London, the Guard consists of 1 officer, 1 corporal major (who carries the standard), 2 non-commissioned officers, 1 trumpeter and 11 troopers. This is known as a Long Guard. When Her Majesty is not resident in London, the Guard is reduced to 2 non-commissioned officers and 10 troopers. This is known as a Short Guard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guard is usually provided by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, with the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals alternating. When the HCMR leaves London for a month of summer training (and vacation for the horses), the guard is provided by the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery. Only two other regiments have had the honour of mounting the Queen's Life Guard; in 2000, the Mounted Troop of Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), a regiment of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, mounted the Queen's Life Guard during the same deployment as The Royal Canadian Regiment provided the Queen's Guard. In 2012, as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the Musical Ride of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police mounted the Queen's Life Guard for a day in May 2012, becoming the first non-military unit to do so.[44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of Guard Changing, the Old Guard forms up on the north side of the enclosure on Horse Guards Parade and the New Guard on the south side. As the New Guard arrives, each Guard carries the Standard and the Trumpeters of both Old and New Guards sound the Royal Salute on the arrival of the New Guard and on the departure of the Old Guard. When both Guards have formed up in the enclosure, the Corporal Major, Senior NCO and the sentries of the first relief of the New Guard leave for the Guard Room which is then handed over. The sentries of the Old Guard, after being relieved, rejoin the remainder of the Old Guard on the north side of the enclosure.

The resort completed an expansion in 2004, adding the 27-story Rendezvous Tower, and underwent renovations in 2011, converting the resort to a Roaring Twenties theme.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Resorts site was originally occupied by two three-story wooden Quaker rooming houses, The Chalfonte House and The Haddon House.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chalfonte House[4] was built in 1868 by Elisha and Elizabeth Roberts. They had purchased a plot of land at North Carolina Avenue and Pacific Avenue from John DaCosta for $6500.00. The hotel was constructed during the winter for a cost of $21,000 and could accommodate 140 guests. They named the hotel for Chalfont St Giles, the town in Buckinghamshire where William Penn is buried. The Chalfonte House was expanded and moved oceanward twice, in 1879 and 1889.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Haddon House was opened across the street, on the current Resorts site, by Samuel and Susanna Hunt in 1869. They named the hotel for the Quaker family who had founded Haddonfield, New Jersey. It was sold to Leeds & Lippincott in 1890. In 1896 they rebuilt The Haddon House at a cost of $200,000, naming the new, larger hotel \\"Haddon Hall\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Leeds then bought The Chalfonte House in 1900 and constructed a modern hotel on the site, the Chalfonte Hotel.  This eight-story $1,000,000 brick building, Atlantic City's first \\"skyscraper\\", was designed by architect Addison Hutton (18341916),[6] and opened its doors to guests on July 2, 1904.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Haddon Hall building was constructed in stages in the 1920s. The 11-story wing facing the Boardwalk was constructed first, with the 15-story center and 11-story rear wings added later in the decade. Soon after the modern Haddon Hall was completed, it was merged by Leeds & Lippincott with the adjacent Chalfonte via a skyway, which still exists and can be seen today. The new Chalfonte-Haddon Hall complex consisted of 1,000 rooms and, at the time of its completion, was the city's largest hotel by capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, under the command of Col. Robert C. McDonald, M.C., (November 27, 1943June 30, 1944) Chalfonte-Haddon Hall was requisitioned by the US Military and put to a new use, as the Atlantic City Air Forces Training & Reception Center Hospital, renamed Thomas England General Hospital.  More than 40 other local hotels were taken over by the United States Military at the same time.[8] The first meeting of the Section on Surgery of the American Academy of Pediatrics was held in the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall on November 21, 1948.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Nixon spoke in front of the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel on June 22, 1971 .\\r\\n[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nResorts International, which was formed in March 1968, first became interested in developing a resort in Atlantic City after the company learned of a planned fourth attempt to bring casino gambling to New Jersey by limiting it to Atlantic City.  The company heavily contributed to the November 1976 gaming referendum which successfully passed that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile campaigning for the gaming initiative, Resorts International also began planning for a future Atlantic City casino by securing an option for 55 acres (220,000?m2) of land on the Atlantic City Boardwalk from the city's Housing and Re-Development Authority as well as acquiring Leeds & Lippincott Company, which owned Chalfonte-Haddon Hall. Resorts purchased 67 percent of Leeds & Lippincott Inc. in August 1976, and completed the acquisition the following month, paying a total of $2.489 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nResorts International reduced the 1,000 rooms at Chalfonte-Haddon Hall to 566 by closing the older, smaller Chalfonte building due to the rooms being impossible to expand to the city's room requirements. The Haddon Hall was easier to convert, and space was available in the building to allow for a casino, restaurants, shops and a showroom.[11]  The company's logic in the decision to use Haddon Hall was that renovating an existing property on the boardwalk would give the company an advantage by allowing the resort to be open at least a year before its new-build competition, as well as being less expensive to construct. Though state leaders preferred companies to build new resorts rather than renovating existing properties, as Resorts International was the first casino project developed in New Jersey, the company was encouraged by the governor.[citation needed] This would not be the case with the later resorts built on the Boardwalk.\\r\\n\\r\\nResorts International opened its doors at 10:00AM on May 26, 1978.  Initial gaming laws in New Jersey only allowed casinos to operate for 18 hours during the week and 20 hours during the weekends. This situation produced massive lines outside of Resorts and people waited hours to get inside after Governor Brendan Byrne cut the ceremonial opening ribbon. The first act in the hotel's 1700-seat Super Star Theater were Steve Lawrence & Eydie Gorme, with Lawrence throwing out the first dice roll at one of the casino's craps tables.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the conversion to Resorts International, the squash courts on the 15th floor of Haddon Hall remained in operation under their original name: The Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Racquet Club.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chalfonte Hotel building was left vacant until demolished in 1980 to make room for a parking lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the initial success of its flagship Atlantic City property, Resorts International struggled to compete with its competition as more casinos were developed on the boardwalk.  Newer and more extravagant resorts began to erode market share and interest in the property during the 1980s, and Resorts International added to the problem by not making any significant upgrades to the property.  Instead, the company focused on expanding its operations in the market by announcing in the mid 1980s its plans to develop a new property in Atlantic City called the Taj Mahal Casino.  Financial difficulties, however, prevented Resorts International from ever completing the Taj Mahal project, and in 1987 the company became a takeover target when Donald Trump purchased a controlling block of Resorts International stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the death of James M. Crosby, Trump made an offer to all remaining Resorts International shareholders in late 1987 to buy all of the remaining outstanding shares of the company's stock that he did not already control. Trump was challenged for control of the company in early 1988, though, when Merv Griffin, through his Griffin Gaming & Entertainment company, also made a bid for all of the stock in Resorts International. After a two-month battle for control of the company, Trump and Griffin finally reached an agreement to divide the company's holdings between them. Trump would receive the stalled Taj Mahal Casino, while Griffin would receive ownership of both Resorts Atlantic City and Resorts Paradise Island in the Bahamas.[13]  The casino later became the location of filming for Merv's variety/game show Ruckus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the conclusion of the deal between Griffin and Trump, Griffin spent $90 million making improvements to Resorts Atlantic City, while selling the Paradise Island property to Sun International Hotels. Griffin later sold the remainder of Griffin Gaming and Entertainment in 1998 to Sun International Hotels for $350 million. Sun International was headed by Sol Kerzner, and under his leadership the company planned a $500 million revamping of the property after completing the purchase. However, the company only completed a $48 million expansion and renovation to Resorts Atlantic City in 1999 before refocusing its efforts on its other international properties. In 2001, Sun International sold the property to Colony Capital for $140 million; less than half of the cost the company originally paid to buy the property.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 10, 2009, it was announced that Resort International was not able to pay the mortgage for more than a year for the Atlantic City property and made a deal to have the loan canceled and surrender the property to RAC Atlantic City Holdings L.L.C. (which is owned by the lenders, Wells Fargo and others).[15] In 2010 former Tropicana Casino and Resort President Dennis Gomes announced his intentions to purchase Resorts Atlantic City for $35 million in cash from the lenders who took over after Colony Capital defaulted. The casino was taken over by DGMB Casinos, a company headed by Dennis Gomes, in December 2010, days before the casino was scheduled to shut down.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2010, a plan was revealed to transform the resort into a Roaring Twenties theme. The re-branding was proposed by current owner Dennis Gomes, and was initiated in December 2010 when he took over the casino. It capitalized on the success of the HBO series Boardwalk Empire and changes accentuate the resort's existing art deco design, as well as presenting new 1920s-era uniforms for employees and music from the time period. The casino also introduced drinks and shows reminiscent of the period.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resort came under controversy in April 2011 after fifteen older and middle-aged cocktail waitresses, some of them longtime employees, were fired after they \\"did not look good enough\\" in skimpy new uniforms introduced as part of the resort's makeover.[17] Several of the former employees filed a discrimination lawsuit against the company for the incident, in which an outside modeling agency had the waitresses model in the uniforms, which were modeled after 1920s-era Flapper outfits. Celebrity attorney Gloria Allred won court permission to represent the former employees.[18] The fired employees were offered jobs for other positions at the resort.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2011, Resorts became the first casino in Atlantic City to market itself to LGBT customers. The resort opened \\"Prohibition\\", the city's first gay casino nightclub, as well as hiring a director of LGBT marketing.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2011, a five-year lease was signed with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, owner of the Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport, New Jersey, to provide a marketing partnership between the casino and racetrack. The agreement allowed Resorts to rename the Haskell Invitational as the Resorts Casino & Hotel Haskell Invitational, and possibilities include a merging of loyalty programs as well as bringing entertainers' appearances at the casino to the racetrack. The program is part of a strategy to mesh horse racing with casino gambling.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nResorts announced an agreement in August 2012 for the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, operator of the Mohegan Sun, to take over management of the casino and hotel.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a Supreme Court ruling in 2018 and passage of a New Jersey law legalizing sports betting, Resorts announced deals with DraftKings and SBTech to open a sportsbook on-property, online, and via mobile devices.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nOcean Tower\\r\\nBuilt in 1927, Ocean Tower is 260?ft (79?m) tall.[24] The tower is the original Haddon Hall that reopened in 1978 and contains 480 guest rooms. The base of the tower is home to the main casino floor, spa, pool, and the main retail and dining level. It also contains a club reserved for qualified casino players called \\"1133\\", as well a 350-seat theater. As of 2013 this building also houses an Online Gaming room, a \\"Margaritaville\\" casino section of the casino floor, as well as a \\"Margaritaville\\" restaurant. Also as of the 2013 the previous \\"1133\\" club has been remodeled and expanded into two separate players clubs named the \\"Epic\\" and \\"Paramount\\" clubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nRendezvous Tower\\r\\nThe 459-room Rendezvous Tower was built on the site of a smaller hotel tower for the casino. The Rendezvous Tower, whose rooms were designed by Bergman Walls Associates, opened in 2004. The tower contains 357 luxury rooms and 42 suites. Combined with the property's existing 480 rooms, Resorts total room inventory was boosted to 879 rooms after it was completed. The exterior of the tower features an Art Deco design that was part of a \\"return to the classics\\" theme which Colony Capital implemented for the property. The new tower also brought upon an expansion of the casino and several new restaurants.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 392134N 742520W? / ?39.3595N 74.4222W? / 39.3595; -74.4222","input":"When did the first casino open in atlantic city?"},{"output":"the Qin and Han dynasties","context":"The merit system is the process of promoting and hiring government employees based on their ability to perform a job, rather than on their political connections. It is the opposite of the spoils system.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known example of a merit system dates to the Qin and Han dynasties. To maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, the government maintained a complex network of officials.[1] Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the civil service examinations, and education became the key for social mobility.[1] After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the nine-rank system was established during the Three Kingdoms period. The concept of a merit system spread from China to British India during the 17th century, and then into continental Europe.[2]\\r\\nThe United States civil service began to run on the spoils system in 1829 when Andrew Jackson became president. The assassination of United States President James A. Garfield by a disappointed office seeker in 1881 proved its dangers. President Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau who believed that the president owed him a civil service position and in not giving him the position, threatened the very being of the republican party. Two years later, the system of appointments to the United States federal bureaucracy was revamped by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which made the merit system common practice. The merit system determines the fitness of the candidate by the ability to pass a written competitive examination, given by a commission of examiners. The answers submitted by candidates must be unsigned, so as to obviate the possibility of favoritism on the part of the examiners. A list is made of the successful candidates, arranged in the order of their merit as shown by the results of the examination. Appointments must be made from this eligible list in the order of rank unless good cause can be shown why one of higher rank should be set aside for one standing lower on the list.[4]\\r\\nProponents of the system admit that the system does not always lead to the choice of most competent candidate but is effective in eliminating those most incompetent.[4] In addition the possible exclusion of most competent candidate is outweighed by the system's benefits such as limiting the ability of nepotism and political favoritism. The power of appointment being vested in the president of the United States by the United States Constitution, it is not within the power of the United States Congress to fetter the president's action by the enactment of laws restricting the exercise of the power of appointments. Thus, in the United States, the merit system has been extensively applied by the voluntary action of the president following self-imposed rules. It has been judicially determined that the civil-service rules promulgated by the president of the United States do not have the force of general law, and confer upon members of the civil service no right to invoke the aid of the courts to protect them against violation thereof. They are the president's laws, and the president alone can enforce them.[5] Working under the supervision of the president is the Merit Systems Protection Board. The MSPB follows nine core principles when governing the executive branch workforce.\\r\\nForced Ranking is a system in which performing employees are ranked into groups a company has established. The term 'Rank and Yank' was created by the former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. The 'Rank and Yank' encouraged terminating the employment of poor performers and replacing them with new personnel. Many like Welch and Former Chief Executive of Microsoft believe in replacing poor performers while others, such as Tom Barry, former Managing Director at BlessingWhite, believe in 're-engaging underperforming employees.'[3]\\r\\nAs the United States has become Anti-Bureaucratic, it has moved away from the outdated depiction of Merit System. Twenty-eight states have established an At Will environment where civil service employees can be fired at any time without cause. In 2014 the Department of Veteran Affairs became overwhelmed with problems with scheduling appointments. Congress called for immediate action and ordered the Department of Veteran Affairs to lay off miscreant employees. Donald F. Kettl, a Professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, explores in his work, The Merit Principle in Crisis, At will practices and whether theyre beneficial to the bureaucratic practices of the government. Kettl states that due to an increase in government programs, firing miscreant bureaucratic employees would only weaken the governments ability to steer. Such repercussions such as Kettls are not the only measures taken by employers.[4]\\r\\nSusan J. Wells, a writer for HR Magazine, expresses her take on Merit Pay and its meaning in No Results, No Raise. [5] Wells believes that the concept of Tough Love makes a more profound impact on the balance of protecting and rewarding those whose performance excels and those whose performance could be improved. Wells elaborates that not rewarding low performers with a merit increase at the end of the year is an ideal way of showing Tough Love.' The idea gives low performing employees a year to improve their performance and receive constant feedback from managerial staff.\\r\\nThe importance of the merit system in a work place is to provide good quality work to the public. When merit is truly assessed in the process of hiring or promoting personnel, an honest, effective, and productive workplace is created.[6] Employees build organizations and the service they provide to customers allows the organization to be successful. Without its employees or customers, an organization would be doomed. Motivated and happy employees are the key principle of the merit system. Employees who are satisfied with their jobs are likely to provide a higher level of productivity (more work in less time-costing organizations less money), less likely to quit (low or lower employee turnover rates), great communication for voicing workplace concerns (trust and comfort between supervisor and employees), little to no abuse of company benefits/incentives, i.e.: lunch breaks, sick leave, bonuses, etc. Bottom line, administration is responsible for providing and setting the atmosphere and standards of a workplace that result in success.[7]\\r\\nThe merit system is criticized that it leads to uncooperative behaviors between employees creating conflict that produces low work ethics. Merit system is based on performance compensation that encourages competition among employees, creating a competitive environment that puts employees at odds with one another. This can lead to unwanted behaviors of conduct that can affect the productivity of the work place. Disrupting team unity to look better on reviews and personal goals become more important than team goals.[8]","input":"Who developed the first governmental system based on merit?"},{"output":"Brockton High School","context":"Brockton High School, established in 1870, is a high school located in Brockton, Massachusetts. It is a part of Brockton Public Schools. As of 2016 Brockton High School, with 4,250 students, is one of the largest high schools in the United States and the largest high school in Massachusetts.[4] Although widely stated by locals to be the largest high school East of the Mississippi River, it is in fact false, as this title is currently held by Brooklyn Technical High School in New York City.[5] Brockton High School's colors are Black & Red and their mascot is the Boxers, which is a reference to the storied boxing history of the city, and also a tribute to hall-of-fame boxers Rocky Marciano and Marvin Hagler, who are both from Brockton and alumni of Brockton High School.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Brockton High was established, it could house only 125 students. As the population of Brockton grew, there was increasing demand for a larger building. In 1906, a new high school was constructed, consisting of an \\"A\\" building and a \\"B\\" building. By the 1960s, student numbers exceeded capacity, causing split sessions; upper classmen and sophomores attended school at different times of the day. The sophomores attended in the afternoon while the upperclassman took their classes in the morning. In 1965, the City Council Finance Committee approved an $8 million proposal to construct a new high school to accommodate the swelling student body. In 1965, the ground for the new building was broken and in 1970, the school was complete. The \\"A\\" building has since been torn down, and the \\"B\\" building currently houses charter and alternative high school programs. Currently there are about 4,250 students housed in the nine buildings which comprise the current high school; the campus is approximately the size of an aircraft carrier (1/3 mile long) and has 13.5 acres (55,000?m2) of floor space, about half the size of the Prudential Center in Boston.[1]\\r\\nNahyo M. Kim of The New York Times wrote that in a period around 10 years before 2010, Brockton High \\"was a case study in failure\\" everyone just kept failing for no apparent reason.[4] At that time the school's unofficial motto was \\"students have a right to fail if they want\\".[4] Around 1999 the school set up a reform plan, using the skill areas of reading, reasoning, speaking, and writing and using them in the school's curriculum. By 2001 student performance improved. Susan Szachowicz, the former principal, said that the school culture and large size was crucial to the school's turnaround. This occurred in a period when education advocates promoted small schools.[7]\\r\\nBrockton High School is set on a small urban campus comprising nine buildings including four student academic buildings divided by colors (Green, Red, Azure, Yellow). The campus also does feature a gym, football stadium, ice skating rink, 25-yard swimming pool, 1608-seat capacity auditorium, TV and Radio stations, four cafeterias, and a planetarium.\\r\\nThe current Brockton High School campus was state of the art for its time when it first opened in 1970, for it featured a modern greenhouse, planetarium, a modern public address system, and a high-tech TV studio (redone in 2003.) It also has the original fire alarm system from 1970, which is still in use as of 2016.\\r\\nIn 1999, 75% of its students failed Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) mathematics examinations and 44% failed MCAS English examinations.[7] Around that period, about 1/3 of students of each Brockton class dropped out.[4] By 2001, student performance improved.[7] Between 2000 and 2001, more students went from failing to passing at Brockton High than at any other school in Massachusetts.[4]\\r\\nIn 2005, 98% of the senior class (850 students) graduated. In 2008 78% of the graduating senior class planned to pursue a college degree.[citation needed] In 2006, Brockton High School was a recipient of the National School Change Award.[citation needed] Brockton High School was one of 7 schools in the United States to receive this award. Out of the seven schools, there were only two high schools.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2008, Brockton students had a higher level of improvement on the English MCAS than 90% of the Massachusetts high schools. By 2010 it was one of the highest performing schools on the MCAS.[7]\\r\\nAs of 2016, the school had approximately 4,250 students. The high school is 60.9% African American, 20.8% White, 2.5% Asian, 12.3% Hispanic, and 3.5% other. In 2016 it was made so everyone could get free lunch. Out of its 4,250 students, 2,161 are male and 2,089 are female.\\r\\nBrockton High is quite well known for its athletics, especially football.

At the school, he led the Bishops to five catholic Conference titles and three Massachusetts Class D State Championship. Colombo amassed 96 wins as the head coach of Archbiship Williams, and 220 wins as the head coach of Brockton.[10]\\r\\nThe school's mascot is the Boxer. The actual mascot is a dog, but the name is a pun in reference to Rocky Marciano and Marvin Hagler, two famous boxers from Brockton. The stadium in which the Boxers' football, soccer and outdoor track teams compete is named Rocky Marciano Stadium in honor of the legendary boxer. With a capacity of approximately 10,000 people, Marciano Stadium is one of the largest high school stadiums in Massachusetts and is one of the premier facilities in the state as well.

Hurricane-force winds were experienced throughout the city, although the most severe portion of Katrina missed the city, hitting nearby St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes. Hurricane Katrina made its final landfall in eastern St. Tammany Parish. The western eye wall passed directly over St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana as a Category 3 hurricane at about 9:45?am Central Time, August 29, 2005.[1] The communities of Slidell, Avery Estates, Lakeshore Estates, Oak Harbor, Eden Isles and Northshore Beach were inundated by the storm surge that extended over six miles inland. The storm surge affected all 57 miles (92?km) of St. Tammany Parishs coastline, including Lacombe, Mandeville and Madisonville.[2] The storm surge in the area of the Rigolets Pass was estimated to be 16 feet, not including wave action, declining to 7 feet (2.1?m) at Madisonville. The surge had a second peak in eastern St. Tammany as the westerly winds from the southern eye wall pushed the surge to the east, backing up at the bottleneck of the Rigolets Pass.\\r\\nIn the City of New Orleans, the storm surge caused approximately 23 breaches in drainage canal and navigational canal levees and floodwalls. As mandated in the Flood Control Act of 1965, responsibility for the design and construction of the city's levees belongs to the United States Army Corps of Engineers and responsibility for their maintenance belongs to the Orleans Levee Board.[3][4] The failures of levees and floodwalls during Katrina are considered by experts to be the worst engineering disaster in the history of the United States.[5] By August 31, 2005, 80% of New Orleans was flooded, with some parts under 15 feet (4.6?m) of water. The famous French Quarter and Garden District escaped flooding because those areas are above sea level. The major breaches included the 17th Street Canal levee, the Industrial Canal levee, and the London Avenue Canal floodwall. These breaches caused the majority of the flooding, according to a June 2007 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[6] The flood disaster halted oil production and refining which increased oil prices worldwide.\\r\\nBetween 80 and 90 percent of the residents of New Orleans were evacuated before the hurricane struck, testifying to some of the success of the evacuation measures.[7] Despite this, many remained in the city, mainly those who did not have access to personal vehicles or who were isolated from the dissemination of news from the local governments. The Louisiana Superdome was used to house and support some of those who were unable to evacuate. Television shots frequently focused on the Superdome as a symbol of the flooding occurring in New Orleans.\\r\\nThe disaster had major implications for a large segment of the population, economy, and politics of the entire United States. It has prompted a Congressional review of the Army Corps of Engineers and the failure of portions of the federally built flood protection system which experts agree should have protected the city's inhabitants from Katrina's surge. Katrina has also stimulated significant research in the academic community into urban planning, real estate finance, and economic issues in the wake of a natural disaster.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Orleans was settled on a natural high ground along the Mississippi River. Later developments that eventually extended to nearby Lake Pontchartrain were built on fill to bring them above the average lake level. Navigable commercial waterways extended from the lake into the interior of the city to promote waterborne commerce. After the construction of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal in 1940, the state closed these waterways causing the town's water table to lower drastically.\\r\\nIn 1965, heavy flooding caused by Hurricane Betsy brought concerns regarding flooding from hurricanes to the forefront. That year Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1965 which, among other issues, gave authority for design and construction of the flood protection in the New Orleans metropolitan area to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, subject to cost sharing principles, some of which were waived by later legislation. The local municipalities were charged with maintenance once the projects were completed. After 1965, the corps built a levee system around a much larger geographic footprint that included previous marshland and swamp. Many new subdivisions were developed to cater to those who preferred a more suburban lifestyle but were open to remaining within the city limits of New Orleans. Historians question why the area farthest east was developed, since it was viable wetlands and because ringing this region with levees did nothing significant toward protecting the city. What expansion accomplished was to increase the amount of land that could be developed, and it was a reason for the Army Corps to expand the size of its project. In addition the structures caused subsidence of up to 8 feet (2.4?m) in some areas due to the consolidation of the underlying organic soils.\\r\\nA 1999ÿ2001 study Richard Camapanella, Tulane School of Architecture, using LIDAR technology found that 51% of the terrestrial surface of the contiguous urbanized portions of Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Bernard parishes lie at or above sea level, with the highest neighborhoods at 10ÿ12 feet (3.0ÿ3.7?m) above mean sea level.[9] Forty nine percent lies below sea level, in places to equivalent depths.\\r\\nWhen authorized, the flood control design and construction were projected to take 13 years to complete. When Katrina made landfall in 2005, the project was between 60ÿ90% complete with a projected date of completion estimated for 2015, nearly 50 years after authorization.[10] Hurricane Georges in September 1998 galvanized some scientists, engineers and politicians into collective planning, Scientific American declared that \\"New Orleans is a disaster waiting to happen\\" in October 2001.[11] However, even the most insistent calls from officials to evacuate ahead of Katrina did not warn that the levees could breach.[12]\\r\\nOn August 29th 2005, flood walls and levees catastrophically failed throughout the metro area. Many collapsed well below design thresholds (17th Street and London Canals). Others collapsed after a brief period of overtopping (Industrial Canal) caused scouring or erosion of the earthen levee walls. In eastern New Orleans, levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway failed in several places because they were built with sand and erodible materials instead of clay, an obvious construction flaw.\\r\\nThe eye of Hurricane Katrina was forecast to pass through the city of New Orleans. In that event, the wind was predicted to come from the north as the storm passed, forcing large volumes of water from Lake Pontchartrain against the levees and possibly into the city. It was also forecast that the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain would reach 14ÿ18 feet (4.3ÿ5.5?m), with waves reaching 7?feet (2?m) above the storm surge.[13]\\r\\nOn August 28, at 10:00?a.m. CDT, the National Weather Service (NWS) field office in New Orleans issued a bulletin predicting catastrophic damage to New Orleans and the surrounding region. Anticipated effects included, at the very least, the partial destruction of half of the well-constructed houses in the city, severe damage to most industrial buildings, rendering them inoperable, the \\"total destruction\\" of all wood-framed low-rise apartment buildings, all windows blowing out in high-rise office buildings, and the creation of a huge debris field of trees, telephone poles, cars, and collapsed buildings.[14] Lack of clean water was predicted to \\"make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\\"\\r\\nIt was also predicted that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render most of the city uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all the water out of the city.[15]\\r\\nOn Saturday night, Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them of the severity of the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that he went to bed that night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.\\r\\nMany New Orleans residents took precautions to secure their homes and prepare for possible evacuation on Friday the 26th and Saturday the 27th. On August 27 the state of Louisiana was declared an emergency area by the Federal Government,[16] and by mid morning of that day, many local gas stations which were not yet out of gas had long lines. Nagin first called for a voluntary evacuation of the city at 5:00?p.m. on August 27 and subsequently ordered a citywide mandatory evacuation at 9:30?a.m. on August 28, the first such order in the city's history. In a live news conference, Mayor Nagin predicted that, \\"the storm surge most likely will topple our levee system\\", and warned that oil production in the Gulf of Mexico would be shut down.\\r\\nMany neighboring areas and parishes also called for evacuations. By mid-afternoon, officials in Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, Lafourche, Terrebonne, Jefferson, St. Tammany, and Washington parishes had called for voluntary or mandatory evacuations.\\"[17]\\r\\nAlthough Mayor Ray Nagin ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city, many people refused to leave or were unable to do so. In Plaquemines Parish, an official described those remaining behind as \\"gambling with their own lives.\\"[18] Reasons were numerous, including a belief that their homes or the buildings in which they planned to stay offered sufficient protection, lack of financial resources or access to transportation, or a feeling of obligation to protect their property. These reasons were complicated by the fact that an evacuation the previous year for Hurricane Ivan had resulted in gridlocked traffic for six to ten hours. The fact that Katrina occurred at the end of the month, before pay checks were in the hands of many was also significant.[19] A \\"refuge of last resort\\" was designated at the Louisiana Superdome. Beginning at noon on August 28 and running for several hours, city buses were redeployed to shuttle local residents from 12 pickup points throughout the city to the \\"shelters of last resort.\\"[20]\\r\\nBy the time Hurricane Katrina came ashore early the next morning, Mayor Nagin estimated that approximately one million people had fled the city and its surrounding suburbs.[21] By the evening of August 28, over 100,000 people remained in the city, with 20,000 taking shelter at the Louisiana Superdome, along with 300 National Guard troops.[22] The Superdome had been used as a shelter in the past, such as during 1998's Hurricane Georges, because it was estimated to be able to withstand winds of up to 200 miles per hour (320?km/h) and water levels of 35 feet (11?m).[23] While supplies of MREs (Meals ready to eat) and bottled water were available at the Superdome, Nagin told survivors to bring blankets and enough food for several days, warning that it would be a very uncomfortable place.\\r\\nHurricane Katrina made its second and third landfalls in the Gulf Coast region on August 29, 2005 as a Category 3 hurricane.\\r\\nOn Monday August 29 area affiliates of local television station WDSU reported New Orleans was experiencing widespread flooding due to breaches of several Army Corps-built levees, was without power, and that there were several instances of catastrophic damage in residential and business areas. Entire neighborhoods on the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain were flooded.\\r\\nThe extensive flooding stranded many residents who were forced to stay in place long after Hurricane Katrina had passed. Stranded survivors dotted the tops of houses citywide. Some were trapped inside attics and were unable to escape. Many people chopped their way onto their roofs with hatchets and sledge hammers, which Mayor Nagin had residents urged to store in their attics in case of such events.[24] Clean water was unavailable, and power outages were expected to last for weeks.\\r\\nBy 11:00?p.m. August 29, Mayor Nagin described the loss of life as \\"significant\\" with reports of bodies floating on the water throughout the city, though primarily in the eastern portions. Some hotels and hospitals reported diesel fuel shortages. The National Guard began setting up temporary morgues in select locations.\\r\\nCoordination of rescue efforts August 29 and August 30 were made difficult by disruption of the communications infrastructure. Many telephones, including most cell phones, and Internet access were inoperable because of line breaks, destruction of base stations, or power failures, even though some base stations had their own back-up generators. In a number of cases, reporters were asked to brief public officials on the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them any other way.\\r\\nAll local television stations were disrupted. Local television stations, and newspapers, moved quickly to sister locations in nearby cities. New Orleans CBS-affiliate WWL-TV was the only local station to remain on the air during and after the storm, broadcasting from Baton Rouge.[25] Broadcasting and publishing on the Internet became an important means of distributing information to evacuees and the rest of the world, with news networks citing blogs like Interdictor and Gulfsails for reports of what was happening in the city.[26] Amateur radio provided tactical and emergency communications and handled health-and-welfare enquiries. By September 4, a temporary communications hub was set up at the Hyatt Hotel in downtown New Orleans.\\r\\nThe first television pictures out of New Orleans shown on national TV were from Houston's ABC owned and operated KTRK which flew its helicopter to New Orleans in the days after the storm.\\r\\nMost of the city's major roads were damaged. The only route out of the city was east to the east bank of New Orleans on the Crescent City Connection bridge. The I-10 Twin Span Bridge traveling east towards Slidell, suffered severe damage; 473 spans were separated from their supports and 64 spans dropped into the lake.[27] The 24-mile (39?km) long Lake Pontchartrain Causeway escaped unscathed but was only carrying emergency traffic.[28] On August 29, at 7:40?a.m. CDT, it was reported that most of the windows on the north side of the Hyatt Regency New Orleans had been blown out, and many other high rise buildings had extensive window damage.[29] The Hyatt was the most severely damaged hotel in the city, with beds reported to be flying out of the windows. Insulation tubes were exposed as the hotel's glass exterior was completely sheared off.\\r\\nLouis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was closed before the storm but reported no flooding in airplane movement areas or inside of the building itself. By August 30, it was reopened to humanitarian and rescue operations. Commercial cargo flights resumed on September 10, and commercial passenger service resumed on September 13.[30]\\r\\nThe Superdome sustained significant damage, including two sections of the roof when waterproof membrane had essentially been peeled off by wind. On August 30, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco ordered the complete evacuation of the remaining people that sought shelter in the Superdome.[31] They were then transported to the Astrodome in Houston, Texas.\\r\\nAs of mid-day Monday, August 29, the eye of Hurricane Katrina passed east of the City subjecting it to hurricane wind conditions, but sparing New Orleans the worst impact. The City seemed to have escaped most of the catastrophic wind damage and heavy rain that had been predicted. Most buildings came through well structurally.\\r\\nHowever, the city's levee and flood walls designed and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Storm surge breached the levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal (\\"MR-GO\\") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded.[32] There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put the majority of the city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.\\r\\nIn a June 2006 report on the disaster,[33] the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers admitted that faulty design specifications, incomplete sections, and substandard construction of levee segments, contributed to the damage done to New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina.[34] A report released by the American Society of Civil Engineers in June 2007 concluded that two-thirds of the flooding in the city could have been avoided if the levees had held.[35]\\r\\nThe failure of the Hurricane Protection Project of New Orleans has prompted many government officials to call for many congressional committee hearings[36] and investigations. The group Levees.org led by Sandy Rosenthal called for 8/29 Commission to investigate both the engineering and decision-making behind the collapse of a flood protection system that should have held against Katrina's storm surge.[37]\\r\\nFinal reports indicate that the official death toll, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, was 1,464 people.[38] The first deaths were reported shortly before midnight on August 28, 2005, as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to Baton Rouge. On September 4, Mayor Nagin speculated that the death toll could rise as high as ten thousand after the clean-up was completed.[39] Some survivors and evacuees reported seeing bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections, especially in the east of the city. The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.\\r\\nThere were six deaths confirmed at the Superdome. Four of these were from natural causes, one was the result of a drug overdose, and one was a suicide. At the Convention Center, four bodies were recovered. One of these four is believed to be the result of a homicide.[40] Body collection throughout the city began on approximately September 9. Prior to that date, the locations of corpses were recorded, but most were not retrieved.\\r\\nLater studies determined that most of New Orleans' Katrina dead were elderly persons living near levee breaches in the Lower Ninth Ward and Lakeview neighborhoods.\\r\\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was characterized by extensive reporting of looting, violence, shooting against rescuers, murder and rape. While some criminal acts did occur, such as the emptying of an entire Walmart,[41] many reports were also exaggerated, inflated, or simply fabricated. Several news organizations went on to issue retractions.[42]\\r\\nThere were reports of snipers taking potshots at rescue helicopters; these were false. Reports of gangs roving the city shooting police officers and survivors were also false, as only one policeman was shot in the aftermath of Katrina and no indictments were brought forward against the supposed gang members.[43]\\r\\nMany reported instances of \\"looting\\" were in fact stranded survivors scavenging necessary supplies such as food, water, clothing, and shelter.[44] Some instances of looting were later found out to have been carried out by a small number of NOPD officers.[45]\\r\\nRebecca Solnit, writing in The Nation, reported that Several weeks after Hurricane Katrina, community organizer and former Black Panther Malik Rahim had told Amy Goodman on her nationally syndicated program DemocracyNow!, \\"During the aftermath, directly after the flooding, in New Orleans hunting season began on young African American men. In Algiers, I believe, approximately around 18 African American males were killed. No one really know[s] what's the overall count.\\"[46]\\r\\nThese investigations led to at least one indictment by the Department of Justice.[47]\\r\\nCivil disturbances in post-Hurricane Katrina were consistent with all existing research on disaster sociology, which concludes that [post-disaster] widespread looting [is] a myth,[48] and were vastly overstated by the media, ultimately fueling a climate of suspicion and paranoia which greatly hampered rescue efforts and further worsened the conditions of the survivors.[49]\\r\\nSome initial reports of mass chaos, particularly in stories about the Superdome, were later found to be exaggerated or rumor.[50] In the Superdome for example, the New Orleans sex crimes unit investigated every report of rape or atrocity and found only two verifiable incidents, both of sexual assault. The department head told reporters, \\"I think it was urban myth. Any time you put 25,000?people under one roof, with no running water, no electricity and no information, stories get told.\\" Based on these reports, government officials expected hundreds of dead to be found in the Superdome, but instead found only six dead: four natural deaths, one drug overdose, and one suicide.[40][51] In a case of reported sniper fire, the \\"sniper\\" turned out to be the relief valve of a gas tank popping every few minutes.[50]\\r\\nAdditional acts of unrest occurred following the storm, particularly with the New Orleans Police Department. In the aftermath, a tourist asked a police officer for assistance, and got the response, \\"Go to hell, it's every man for himself.\\"[52] Also, one-third of New Orleans police officers deserted the city in the days before the storm, many of them escaping in their department-owned patrol cars. This added to the chaos by stretching law enforcement thin.[53] Additionally, several NOPD officers were arrested weeks after Katrina for suspicion of vehicle theft.[54]\\r\\nThe City of Gretna on the West Bank of the Mississippi River received considerable press coverage when, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina (late August 2005), displaced and dehydrated survivors who attempted to escape from New Orleans by walking over the Crescent City Connection bridge over the Mississippi River were turned back at gunpoint by City of Gretna Police, along with Crescent City Connection Police and Jefferson Parish Sheriff's deputies, who set up a roadblock on the bridge in the days following the hurricane.\\r\\nOn August 31, New Orleans's 1,500-member police force was ordered to abandon search and rescue missions and turn its attention toward controlling the widespread looting.[citation needed] The city also ordered a mandatory curfew. Mayor Nagin called for increased federal assistance in a \\"desperate S.O.S.\\", following the city's inability to control looting. He was often misquoted as declaring \\"martial law\\" in the city, despite there being no such term in Louisiana state law (a declaration of a state of emergency was instead made).[55] On the same day, Governor Kathleen Blanco announced the arrival of a military presence, stating that \\"they have M-16s and are locked and loaded. These troops know how to shoot and kill and I expect they will.\\"[56] Despite the increased law enforcement presence, crime continued to be a problem.[citation needed]\\r\\nRelief efforts were constantly disrupted by violence[citation needed], and there were reports[citation needed] of groups of armed men running rampant through the streets, looting and pillaging unattended buildings and stores.[citation needed] Charity Hospital, one of several facilities attempting to evacuate patients, was forced to halt the effort after coming under gunfire.[57] By September 1, 6,500 National Guard troops had arrived in New Orleans, and on September 2 Blanco requested a total of 40,000 for assistance in evacuation and security efforts in Louisiana.[58][59][60][61] In addition, the Louisiana State Guard and state defense forces from several states were activated to aid the National Guard in sheltering the large number of refugees leaving Louisiana and assist in other disaster recovery operations.[62]\\r\\nSome concern over the availability and readiness of the Louisiana National Guard to help stabilize the security situation was raised. Guardsman Lieutenant Colonel Pete had commented that \\"dozens of high water vehicles, humvees, refuelers, and generators were abroad.\\"[63] At the time of the hurricane, approximately 3,000 members of the Guard were serving a tour of duty in Iraq. With total personnel strength of 11,000, this meant that 27% of the Louisiana National Guard was abroad.[64] However, both the White House and the Pentagon argued that the depletion of personnel and equipment did not impact the ability of the Guard to perform its missionrather, impassable roads and flooded areas were the major factors impeding the Guardsmen from securing the situation in New Orleans.\\r\\nBefore Hurricane Katrina, the murder rate in New Orleans was ten times higher than the U.S. average. After the situation in New Orleans was brought under control, criminal activity in New Orleans dropped significantly.[65]\\r\\nIn response to the increase in criminal activity in New Orleans, makeshift prisons were constructed to house prisoners for short periods of time. Camp Greyhound was a temporary prison that housed more than 200 suspected looters in New Orleans until they could be transferred to other institutions. With room for 700 prisoners, the facility was guarded by officers from one of the United States' toughest prisons, the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.[66] The station's bus terminals were converted into chain-link prison cells that could hold up to fifteen prisoners each. These prisoners were kept in conditions that included a portable toilet and military issued meals, but excluded a mattress or cot.[67]\\r\\nLaw enforcement constructed the necessary offices of a police station in the general areas of the bus station, which included the offices of the District Attorney and the Justice Department.[68] Camp Greyhound did have several issues with police records due to flooding, and prisoners who had committed minor infractions were kept in the same areas as those with more serious allegations. The facility was run on backup generators and outdated fingerprinting methods were used, which added to the confusion of the facility.[69]\\r\\nAs one of the largest structures in the city, evacuees were brought to the Superdome to wait out the storm or to await further evacuation. Many others made their way to the Superdome on their own, hoping to find food, water, shelter, or transport out of town. On August 29, Katrina passed over New Orleans with such force that it ripped two holes in the Superdome roof. On the evening of August 30, Maj. Gen. Bennett C. Landreneau, of the Louisiana National Guard, said that the number of people taking shelter in the Superdome had risen to around 15,000 to 20,000 as search and rescue teams brought more people to the Superdome from areas hard-hit by the flooding.[70] As conditions worsened and flood waters continued to rise, on August 31, Governor Blanco ordered that all of New Orleans, including the Superdome, be evacuated. The area outside the Superdome was flooded to a depth of 3 feet (0.91?m), with a possibility of 7 feet (2.1?m) if the area equalized with Lake Pontchartrain. Governor Blanco had the state send in 68 school buses on Monday to begin evacuating people.[71]\\r\\nDespite increasingly squalid conditions, the population inside continued to grow. The situation inside the building was described as chaotic; reports of rampant drug use, fights, rape, and filthy living conditions were widespread. At the time, as many as 100 were reported to have died in the Superdome, with most deaths resulting from heat exhaustion, but other reported incidents included an accused rapist who was beaten to death by a crowd and an apparent suicide.[72] Despite these reports, though, the final official death toll was significantly less: six people died inside (4 of natural causes, one overdose, and an apparent suicide) and a few more in the general area outside the stadium.[40]\\r\\nFEMA had announced that, in conjunction with Greyhound, the National Guard, and Houston Metro, the 25,000?people at the Superdome would be relocated across state lines to the Houston Astrodome.[73] Roughly 475 buses were promised by FEMA to ferry evacuees with the entire evacuation expected to take two days.[74] By September 4, the Superdome had been completely evacuated.\\r\\nAlthough the Superdome suffered damage by water and wind to the overall interior and exterior structures, as well as interior damage from human waste and trash, the facility was repaired at a cost of US$140?million and was ready for games by the autumn of 2006.[75]\\r\\nBecause of Hurricane Katrina, the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center suffered a loss of water pressure and electricity, and one of its convention halls had a large hole in its ceiling. The center was otherwise only lightly damaged.[76]\\r\\nOn August 29, as people were being turned away at the Superdome and rescues continued, rescuers began dropping people off at the Convention Center, which, at 8 feet (2?m) above sea level, easily escaped the flood. Captain M.A. Pfeiffer of the NOPD was quoted as saying, \\"It was supposed to be a bus stop where they dropped people off for transportation. The problem was, the transportation never came.\\"[76] By the afternoon of the 29th, the crowd had grown to about 1,000?people. The convention center's president (who was there with a small group of convention center employees at this time) addressed the crowd near dark, informing them that there was no food, water, medical care, or other services. By late on the evening of the 29th, the convention center had been broken into, and evacuees began occupying the inside of the convention center.[76]\\r\\nA contingent of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied one part of the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units.[76] The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000?people.[77] Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface.[78][79] In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.\\r\\nBy September 1, the facility, like the Superdome, was completely overwhelmed and declared unsafe and unsanitary. However, even though there were thousands of people who were evacuating at the center, along with network newscasters, pleading desperately for help on CNN, FOX, and other broadcast outlets, FEMA head Michael Brown and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff both claimed to have no knowledge of the use of the Convention Center as a shelter until the afternoon of September 1.[80]\\r\\nA sizable contingent of National Guard arrived on September 2 to establish order and provide essential provisions, and on September 3, buses began arriving at the convention center to pick up the refugees there.[76] The Convention Center was completely evacuated by September 4.\\r\\nOn August 31, a public health emergency was declared for the entire Gulf Coast, and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco ordered a mandatory evacuation of all those remaining in New Orleans. Relief organizations scrambled to locate suitable areas for relocating evacuees on a large scale. Many of the survivors in the Superdome were bussed to the Reliant Astrodome in Houston, Texas. Houston agreed to shelter an additional 25,000 evacuees beyond those admitted to the Astrodome, including one \\"renegade bus\\" that was commandeered by private citizen Jabbar Gibson, who had been released on bond from the Orleans Parish Prison just days before the storm hit, and had a previous criminal conviction. By September 1, the Astrodome was declared full and could not accept any more evacuees. The George R. Brown Convention Center nearby was opened to house additional evacuees. San Antonio, Texas also agreed to house 25,000 refugees, beginning relocation efforts in vacant office buildings on the grounds of KellyUSA, a former air force base, and Reunion Arena in Dallas, Texas was mobilized to house incoming evacuees, and smaller shelters were established in towns across Texas and Oklahoma. Arkansas also opened various shelters and state parks throughout the state for evacuees.\\r\\nExpected to last only two days, the evacuation of remaining evacuees proved more difficult than rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure and a growing number of evacuees. By the morning of September 1, Governor Blanco reported that the number of evacuees in the Superdome was down to 2,500. However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, the Superdome held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn. Evacuees from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000, believing the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town.\\r\\nEvacuation efforts were hastened on September 2 by the wider dispersal of evacuees among newly opened shelters. Louis Armstrong International Airport was reopened to allow flights related to relief efforts, and began to load evacuees onto planes as well.\\r\\nElements of the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in New Orleans September 3. The flooding was a challenge for the paratroopers when they first arrived. The division had just four boats at the time, however, the division quickly started getting Coast Guard, Navy and Marine assets placed under their control. Army Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the 82nd's commanding general, noted: \\"We eventually became the 82nd 'Waterborne' Division,\\" the general said, \\"and that really was our forte\\" during search-and-rescue and security missions in flooded sections of the city.\\r\\nTask Force Katrina Commander Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore also charged the paratroopers to straighten out the evacuation situations at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, the New Orleans Convention Center and the Superdome. In all, 3,600 of the division's paratroopers were deployed to New Orleans to participate in Task Force All-American. The unit worked in tandem with state, local and other federal authorities to feed, process and transport evacuees to other accommodations; the division's soldiers helped evacuate 6,000 New Orleans residents. By September 18, the 82nd Division medical personnel had treated 1,352?people and given 2,047 immunizations, according to unit documents. By September 19, 82nd Division military engineers had cleared 185 city blocks of debris, cleared 113 streets, and removed 218 trees, according to unit documents.[81]\\r\\nOn September 3, some 42,000 evacuees were evacuated from New Orleans, including those remaining in the Superdome and Convention Center. Efforts turned to the hundreds of people still trapped in area hotels, hospitals, schools and private homes.[82]\\r\\nOn September 6, Mayor Ray Nagin ordered a forced evacuation of everyone from the city who was not involved in clean up work, citing safety and health concerns.[83] The order was given not only as an attempt to restore law and order, but also out of concern about the hazardous living conditions in the city. Eviction efforts escalated three days later, when door-to-door searches were conducted to advise remaining residents to leave the city. Despite this, a number of residents defied the eviction order. While initially lax in enforcing evictions, National Guard troops eventually began to remove residents by force.[84]\\r\\nThere was a concern that the prolonged flooding would lead to an outbreak of health problems for those who remained in the city. In addition to dehydration and food poisoning, there was also potential for the spread of hepatitis A, cholera, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever, all related to the growing contamination of food and drinking water supplies in the city compounded by the city's characteristic heat and stifling humidity.[85] Survivors could also face long-term health risks due to prolonged exposure to the petrochemical tainted flood waters and mosquito-borne diseases such as yellow fever, malaria and West Nile Virus.[86][87]\\r\\nOn September 2, an emergency triage center was set up at the airport. A steady stream of helicopters and ambulances brought in the elderly, sick, and injured. Baggage equipment was used as gurneys to transport people from the flight line to the hospital, which was set up in the airport terminal. The scene could be described as, \\"organized chaos\\", but efficient. By September 3, the situation started to stabilize. Up to 5,000 people had been triaged and fewer than 200 remained at the medical unit.[88]\\r\\nHospital evacuations continued from other area hospitals that were flooded or damaged. Reports from the Methodist Hospital indicated that people were dying of dehydration and exhaustion while the staff worked unendingly in horrendous conditions. The first floor of the hospital flooded and the dead were stacked in a second floor operating room. Patients requiring ventilators were kept alive with hand-powered resuscitation bags.\\r\\nAmong the many hospitals shut down by damage related to the hurricane was the public hospital serving New Orleans, Charity Hospital, which was also the only trauma center serving that region. The destruction of the hospital's structure has forced the continued closure as funding for a new building is sought out.\\r\\nOn September 6, E. coli was detected in the water supply. According to the CDC, five people died from bacterial infections caused by the toxic waters. The deaths appear to have been caused by Vibrio vulnificus bacteria, of the Cholera family.[89]\\r\\nBefore Katrinas landfall in 2005, the economy of New Orleans relied heavily on its usefulness and income derived from being a port city. The population grew and the economy peaked in the late 19th century. However, in the recent years, after rapid industrialization and the development of faster methods of transporting goods, the economy of New Orleans has been in a steady decline.[90] As a result, New Orleans came to rely on three major industries for economic revenue: transportation, entertainment, and public services.[91] However, after Katrinas landfall, these sectors, including the overall economy, were reduced and heavily affected by the natural disaster.\\r\\nAfter the hurricane, the labor force diminished and wages decreased by staggering amounts. In July 2005, 9,592 people applied for unemployment services and the payroll of metropolitan firms declined by 13.6% between July 2005 and July 2007, indicating an estimated loss of 70,000 jobs.[92] The sectors most affected were service-related industries, fluctuating with the population. The only sector to truly thrive after landfall was construction, which was in high demand to make needed repairs and rebuild destroyed homes.[91]\\r\\nIn the first initial months following Katrina, the labor force reduced faster than the demand and unemployment rates skyrocketed. However, as of September 2006, the unemployment rates have never fallen below national average, indicating improvement.[93] In the second quarters of both 2005 and 2007, the firms' wages were increased by 21%, twice more than national increases, indicating even further improvement, although the gains were varied across the sectors.[94]\\r\\nThere have been some suggestions concerning the usage of natural capital to further aid New Orleanss economy. One such is that, as opposed to rebuilding on flooded lands, restoring acres of wetlands to profit from the economic wealth.[95] The Mississippi delta provides the United States with one of the largest fisheries and the most important flyway terminus, enabling New Orleans to profit from these ecological industries.[95] Furthermore, by increasing the wetlands, it would help create a natural barrier that could aid New Orleans in future storms.[96] It is estimated that if New Orleans were to restore 1,700 square miles (4,400?km2) of wetland lost before 2005, the natural capital would be worth an estimated $6 billion/year, or $200 billion at the present value.[96] While New Orleans has made numerous efforts in rebuilding their economy, and has been successful with tourist-attracting events such as Mardi Gras, the natural capital provided could further assist the city in returning to its pre-Katrina wealth and economy.\\r\\nFollowing Katrina, many said that the hurricane had greater impact on black and less economically privileged people, and that it had relatively less impact on predominantly white, and wealthier people. \\"The citys remarkable recovery has, to a troubling degree, left behind the African-Americans who still make up the majority of its population,\\" according to FiveThirtyEight.[97] They based this on statistics showing that black residents of New Orleans are more likely to be unemployed than when the storm hit, and more likely to be living in poverty. Household incomes of blacks have also fallen, and the wage gap between black and whites has grown. All these changes are attributed in some way to Katrina.[97]\\r\\nAbout 175,000 black residents departed New Orleans over the year following the storm, while only 100,000 returned, pushing the African American population to 59 percent, from 66 percent previously. The biggest impact has been on the middle-class blacks, given that most black professionals are older and more advanced in their careers, and the majority of the affluent and middle class are white.[97]\\r\\nThese setbacks to the black population in New Orleans corresponded with a large number of educated white arrivals, contributing to a high rate of business formation in the city. These newcomers have had the effect of driving up housing prices, making rent less affordable for the majority black residents.[97]\\r\\nThe influence of blacks in the city receded politically, too: in 2010 New Orleans elected its first white mayor in 32 years, a white majority (5-2) took control of the City Council, which had previously been black, and a white police chief and district attorney were elected. Lance Hill of Tulane University said: \\"The perception among most African-Americans is that they are living politically as a defeated group in their own city.\\"[98]\\r\\nAfter Hurricane Katrina, many African-American's suffered from mental illnesses--such as PTSD--at higher rates than their Caucasian counterparts. Populations experiencing mental illnesses, especially after a natural disaster, is not uncommon. African-Americans, however, \\"had approximately two-fold greater odds of screening positive for PTSD\\" after Hurricane Katrina than whites.[99] It is deduced that African-Americans exhibit PTSD at higher frequencies than whites because they \\"were more likely to experience frequent mental distress.\\"[99] For example, African-American's \\"report more negative events and chronic stressors--witnessing violence, receiving bad news, death events, lifetime major discrimination, daily discrimination--than whites, which negatively affects their mental health.\\"[99] African-Americans \\"are more segregated than any other racial/ethnic group in the United States, and racial segregation is associated with poorer quality housing and neighborhoods that have limited resources to enhance health and well-being.\\"[99] Another study found that the \\"[b]lack race was associated with greater symptom severity\\" of PTSD than other races.[100] It is known that \\"[m]inority status itself has been shown to increase the risk of PTSD after trauma, though this effect may be largely because of differential exposure to poverty in violence.\\"[100] Additionally, the \\"largely Black population of New Orleans bore a disproportionally heavy burden of predisaster chronic disease complicated by inadequate health care access.\\"[100]","input":"What caused the greatest loss of life and property during hurricane katrina?"},{"output":"March 18, 2005","context":"","input":"When did the suite life of zack and cody first air?"},{"output":"244,000","context":"The Northern Territory (abbreviated as NT) is a federal Australian territory in the central and central northern regions of Australia. It shares borders with Western Australia to the west (129th meridian east), South Australia to the south (26th parallel south), and Queensland to the east (138th meridian east). To the north, the territory is bordered by the Timor Sea, the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Despite its large areaover 1,349,129 square kilometres (520,902?sq?mi), making it the third largest Australian federal divisionit is sparsely populated. The Northern Territory's population of 244,000 (2016) makes it the least populous of Australia's eight major states and territories, having fewer than half as many people as Tasmania.[1]\\r\\nThe archaeological history of the Northern Territory begins over 40,000 years ago when Indigenous Australians settled the region. Makassan traders began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for trepang from at least the 18th century onwards. The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century. The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions. After three failed attempts to establish a settlement (1824ÿ1828, 1838ÿ1849, and 1864ÿ66), success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at Port Darwin. Today the economy is based on tourism, especially Kakadu National Park in the Top End and the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park (Ayers Rock) in central Australia, and mining.\\r\\nThe capital and largest city is Darwin. The population is concentrated in coastal regions and along the Stuart Highway. The other major settlements are (in order of size) Palmerston, Alice Springs, Katherine, Nhulunbuy, and Tennant Creek. Residents of the Northern Territory are often known simply as \\"Territorians\\" and fully as \\"Northern Territorians\\", or more informally as \\"Top Enders\\" and \\"Centralians\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndigenous Australians have lived in the present area of the Northern Territory for an estimated 40,000 years, and extensive seasonal trade links existed between them and the peoples of what is now Indonesia for at least five centuries.\\r\\nWith the coming of the British, there were four early attempts to settle the harsh environment of the northern coast, of which three failed in starvation and despair. The Northern Territory was part of colonial New South Wales from 1825 to 1863, except for a brief time from February to December 1846, when it was part of the short-lived colony of North Australia. It was part of South Australia from 1863 to 1911. Under the administration of colonial South Australia, the overland telegraph was constructed between 1870 and 1872.\\r\\nA railway was also built between Palmerston and Pine Creek between 1883 and 1889. The economic pattern of cattle raising and mining was established so that by 1911 there were 513,000 cattle. Victoria River Downs was at one time the largest cattle station in the world. Gold was found at Grove Hill in 1872 and at Pine Creek, Brocks Creek, Burrundi, and copper was found at Daly River.\\r\\nOn 1 January 1911, a decade after federation, the Northern Territory was separated from South Australia and transferred to Commonwealth control. Alfred Deakin opined at this time \\"To me the question has been not so much commercial as national, first, second, third and last. Either we must accomplish the peopling of the northern territory or submit to its transfer to some other nation.\\"[5]\\r\\nIn late 1912 there was growing sentiment that the name \\"Northern Territory\\" was unsatisfactory.[6][7] The names \\"Kingsland\\" (after King George V and to correspond with Queensland), \\"Centralia\\" and \\"Territoria\\" were proposed with Kingsland becoming the preferred choice in 1913. However, the name change never went ahead.[8][9]\\r\\nFor a brief time between 1927 and 1931 the Northern Territory was divided into North Australia and Central Australia at the 20th parallel of South latitude. Soon after this time, parts of the Northern Territory were considered in the Kimberley Plan as a possible site for the establishment of a Jewish Homeland, understandably considered the \\"Unpromised Land\\".\\r\\nDuring World War II, most of the Top End was placed under military government. This is the only time since Federation that part of an Australian state or territory has been under military control. After the war, control for the entire area was handed back to the Commonwealth. The Bombing of Darwin occurred on 19 Feb 1942. It was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia. Evidence of Darwins World War II history is found at a variety of preserved sites in and around the city, including ammunition bunkers, airstrips, oil tunnels and museums.\\r\\nIndigenous Australians had struggled for rights to fair wages and land. An important event in this struggle was the strike and walk off by the Gurindji people at Wave Hill Cattle Station in 1966. The Commonwealth Government of Gough Whitlam set up the Woodward Royal Commission in February 1973, which set to enquire into how land rights might be achieved in the Northern Territory. Justice Woodward's first report in July 1973 recommended that a Central Land Council and a Northern Land Council be established to present to him the views of Aboriginal people. In response to the report of the Royal Commission a Land Rights Bill was drafted, but the Whitlam Government was dismissed before it was passed.\\r\\nThe Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 was eventually passed by the Fraser Government on 16 December 1976 and began operation on the following Australia Day (26 January 1977).\\r\\nIn 1974, from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, the city of Darwin, Northern Territory, was devastated by tropical Cyclone Tracy. Cyclone Tracy killed 71 people, caused A$837 million in damage (1974 dollars), or approximately A$4.45 billion (2014 dollars), and destroyed more than 70 percent of Darwin's buildings, including 80 per cent of houses. Tracy left more than 41,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless. The city was rebuilt with much improved construction codes and is a modern, landscaped metropolis today.\\r\\nIn 1978 the Territory was granted responsible government, with a Legislative Assembly headed by a Chief Minister. The Administrator of the Northern Territory is an official acting as the Queen's indirect representative in the Territory.\\r\\nDuring 1995ÿ6 the Northern Territory was briefly one of the few places in the world with legal voluntary euthanasia, until the Federal Parliament overturned the legislation.[10] Before the over-riding legislation was enacted, four people used the law supported by Dr. Philip Nitschke.\\r\\nThere are many very small settlements scattered across the territory, but the larger population centres are located on the single paved road that links Darwin to southern Australia, the Stuart Highway, known to locals simply as \\"the track\\".\\r\\nThe Northern Territory is also home to two spectacular natural rock formations, Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Kata Tjuta (The Olgas), which are sacred to the local Aboriginal peoples and which have become major tourist attractions.\\r\\nIn the northern part of the Territory lies Kakadu National Park, which features breathtaking wetlands and native wildlife. To the north of that lies the Arafura Sea, and to the east lies Arnhem Land, whose regional centre is Maningrida on the Liverpool River delta. There is an extensive series of river systems in the Northern Territory. These rivers include: the Alligator Rivers, Daly River, Finke River, McArthur River, Roper River, Todd River and Victoria River.\\r\\nMount Sonder, the fourth highest mountain in the Northern Territory after nearby Mount Zeil, in West MacDonnell National Park\\r\\nNourlangie Rock in Kakadu National Park\\r\\nJim Jim Falls, Kakadu National Park\\r\\nUluru (Ayers Rock), one of the best known images of the Northern Territory\\r\\nAerial view of Uluru\\r\\nThe Northern Territory has two distinctive climate zones.\\r\\nThe northern end, including Darwin, has a tropical climate with high humidity and two seasons, the wet (October to April) and dry season (May to September). During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as 14?C (57?F), but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.\\r\\nThe wet season is associated with tropical cyclones and monsoon rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70% during the wettest months. On average more than 1,570?mm (62?in) of rain falls in the north. Rainfall is highest in north-west coastal areas, where rainfall averages from 1,800ÿ2,100mm (72ÿ84?in).\\r\\nThe central region is the desert centre of the country, which includes Alice Springs and Ayers Rock, and is semi-arid with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from October to March. Central Australia receives less than 250?mm (9.8?in) of rain per year.\\r\\nThe highest temperature recorded in the territory was 48.3?C (118.9?F) at Finke on 1 and 2 January 1960. The lowest temperature was ?7.5?C (18.5?F) at Alice Springs on 17 July 1976.[12]\\r\\nThe Northern Territory Parliament is one of the three unicameral parliaments in the country. Based on the Westminster System, it consists of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly which was created in 1974, replacing the Northern Territory Legislative Council.\\r\\nThe Northern Territory Legislative Council was the partly elected governing body from 1947 until its replacement by the fully elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1974. The total enrolment for the 1947 election was 4,443. The Northern Territory was split into five electorates: Darwin, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Batchelor, and Stuart.\\r\\nWhilst this assembly exercises similar powers as the governments of the states of Australia, it does so by legislated devolution of powers from the Commonwealth Government, rather than by any constitutional right. As such, the Commonwealth Government retains the right to legislate for the Territory, including the power to override legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly. The Monarch is represented by the Administrator of the Northern Territory, who performs a role similar to that of a state governor.\\r\\nTwenty-five members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member electorates.\\r\\nFor several years there has been agitation for full statehood. A referendum of voters in the Northern Territory was held on the issue in 1998, which resulted in a 'no' vote. This was a shock to both the Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments, for opinion polls showed most Territorians supported statehood. However, under the Australian Constitution, the Federal Government may set the terms of entry to full statehood. The Northern Territory was offered three Senators, rather than the twelve guaranteed to original states. (Because of the difference in populations, equal numbers of Senate seats would mean a Territorian's vote for a Senator would have been worth more than 30 votes in New South Wales or Victoria.) Alongside what was cited as an arrogant approach adopted by then Chief Minister Shane Stone, it is believed that most Territorians, regardless of their general views on statehood, were reluctant to adopt the particular offer that was made.[13]\\r\\nThe Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is the head of government of a self-governing territory, while the head of government of a state is a Premier. The Chief Minister is appointed by the Administrator of the Northern Territory, who in normal circumstances will appoint the leader of whichever party holds the majority of seats in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The current Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is Michael Gunner of the Australian Labor Party. He replaced Adam Giles on 31 August 2016.\\r\\nThe Northern Territory received self-government on 1 July 1978 under its own Administrator of the Northern Territory appointed by the Governor-General of Australia. The Commonwealth government, not the Government of the Northern Territory, advises the governor-general on appointment of the Administrator, but by convention, consults first with the Territory Government. The current Administrator is John Hardy.\\r\\nThe Northern Territory is represented in the Commonwealth parliament by two Members in the House of Representatives and two members in the Senate. As of September 2016[update], resulting from the 2016 federal election, Warren Snowdon from the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and Luke Gosling from the Australian Labor Party (ALP) serve in the House of Representatives, and Malarndirri McCarthy from the ALP and Nigel Scullion from the CLP serve in the Senate.\\r\\nThe Northern Territory is divided into 17 local government areas, including 11 shires and five municipalities. Shire, city and town councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Northern Territory parliament, such as road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.\\r\\nAboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory are groups of Aboriginal landowners, set up under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act.\\r\\nThe two dominant political parties in the Northern Territory are the conservative Country Liberal Party, and the social-democratic Australian Labor Party. Minor parties that are also active in the NT are the Northern Territory Greens, Palmer United Party and Australia's First Nations Political Party. In the 2016 NT elections only two CLP representatives were elected (MLAs Higgins and Finocchiaro) plus five independents. This makes the parliamentary status of the CLP as a major party a matter of interest.\\r\\nThe population of the Northern Territory at the 2011 Australian census was 211,945,[14] a 10 per cent increase from the 2006 census. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated a June 2015 resident population of 244,300, taking into account residents overseas or interstate. The Territory's population represents 1% of the total population of Australia.[1][15][16]\\r\\nThe Northern Territory's population is the youngest in Australia and has the largest proportion (23.2%) under 15 years of age and the smallest proportion (5.7%) aged 65 and over. The median age of residents of the Northern Territory is 31 years, six years younger than the national median age.[14]\\r\\nMore than 100 nationalities are represented in the Northern Territory's population, including more than 50 organisations representing different ethnic groups.[17]\\r\\nThe 2011 Census revealed that the most common ancestries in Northern Territory were Australian 23.9%, English 19.4%, Australian Aboriginal 14.7%, Irish 6.2% and Scottish 5.1%.[18]\\r\\nIn terms of birthplace, according to the 2011 census 25.4% of the population were born overseas.[14] 2.5% of Territorians were born in England, 1.9% in New Zealand, 1.7% in Philippines, 0.9% in India and 0.5% in the United States.\\r\\nIndigenous Australians own some 49% of the land. The life expectancy of Aboriginal Australians is well below that of non-Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory, a fact that is mirrored elsewhere in Australia. ABS statistics suggest that Indigenous Australians die about 11 years earlier than the average Australian. There are Aboriginal communities in many parts of the territory, the largest ones being the Pitjantjatjara near Uluru, the Arrernte near Alice Springs, the Luritja between those two, the Warlpiri further north, and the Yolngu in eastern Arnhem Land.\\r\\nMore than 54% of Territorians live in Darwin, located in the territory's north (Top End). Less than half of the territory's population live in the rural Northern Territory.\\r\\nIn the 2011 census Roman Catholics form the single largest religious group in the territory with 19.7% of the Northern Territory's population, followed by Anglican (10.6%), Uniting Church (10.1%) and Lutheran (7%). Buddhism is the territory's largest non-Christian religion (0.8%), followed by Hinduism (0.4%) and Islam (0.3%). Around 20% of Territorians do not profess any religion.[20]\\r\\nMany Aborigines practice their traditional religion, the belief in the Dreamtime.\\r\\nThere are more than 100 Aboriginal languages spoken in the Northern Territory,[21] in addition to English which is most common in cities such as Darwin or Alice Springs. Major indigenous languages spoken in the Northern Territory include Murrinh-patha and Ngangikurrungurr in the northwest around Wadeye, Warlpiri and Warumungu in the center around Tennant Creek, Arrernte around Alice Springs, Pintupi-Luritja to the south east, Pitjantjatjara in the south near Uluru, Yolngu Matha to the far north in Arnhem Land (where the dialect Djambarrpuyngu of Dhuwal is considered a lingua franca), and Burarra, Maung, Iwaidja and Gunwinggu in the center north and on Croker Island and the Goulburn Islands. Tiwi is spoken on Melville Island and Bathurst Island.[22] Literature in many of these languages is available in the Living Archive of Aboriginal Languages.\\r\\nA Northern Territory school education consists of six years of primary schooling, including one transition year, three years of middle schooling, and three years of secondary schooling. In the beginning of 2007, the Northern Territory introduced Middle School for Years 7ÿ9 and High School for Years 10ÿ12. Northern Territory children generally begin school at age five. On completing secondary school, students earn the Northern Territory Certificate of Education (NTCE). Students who successfully complete their secondary education also receive a tertiary entrance ranking, or ENTER score, to determine university admittance. An International Baccalaureate is offered at one school in the Territory ÿ Kormilda College.\\r\\nNorthern Territory schools are either publicly or privately funded. Public schools, also known as state or government schools, are funded and run directly by the Department of Education.[23] Private fee-paying schools include schools run by the Catholic Church and independent schools, some elite ones similar to English public schools. Some Northern Territory Independent schools are affiliated with Protestant, Lutheran, Anglican, Greek Orthodox or Seventh-day Adventist churches, but include non-church schools and an Indigenous school.\\r\\nAs of 2009, the Northern Territory had 151 public schools, 15 Catholic schools and 21 independent schools. 39,492 students were enrolled in schools around the Territory with 29,175 in public schools, and 9,882 in independent schools. The Northern Territory has about 4,000 full-time teachers.\\r\\nThe Northern Territory has one university. Northern Territory University (now called Charles Darwin University) opened in 1989.[24] Charles Darwin University had about 19,000 students enrolled: about 5500 higher education students and about 13500 students on vocational education and training (VET) courses. The first tertiary institution in the territory was the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education (established in the mid-1960s).\\r\\nThe Northern Territory Library is the Territory's research and reference library. It is responsible for collecting and preserving the Northern Territory documentary heritage and making it available through a range of programs and services. Material in the collection includes books, newspapers, magazines, journals, manuscripts, maps, pictures, objects, sound and video recordings and databases.\\r\\nThe Northern Territory's economy is largely driven by mining, which is concentrated on energy producing minerals, petroleum and energy and contributes around $2.5 billion to the gross state product and employs over 4,600 people. Mining accounts for 14.9% of the gross state product in 2014-15 compared to just 7% nationally.[25]\\r\\nIn recent years, largely due to the effect of major infrastructure projects and mine expansions, construction has overtaken mining as the largest single industry in the Territory. Construction, mining and manufacturing, and government and community services, combine to account for about half of the Territory's gross state product (GSP), compared to about a third of national gross domestic product (GDP).[26]\\r\\nThe economy has grown considerably over the past decade, from a value of $15 billion in 2004-05 to over $22 billion in 2014-15. In 2012-13 the Territory economy expanded by 5.6%, over twice the level of national growth, and in 2014-15 it grew by 10.5%, four times the national growth rate.[27]\\r\\nBetween 2003 and 2006 the gross state product had risen from $8,670 million to $11,476 million and increase of 32.4%. During the three years to 2006-2007 the Northern Territory gross state product grew by an average annual rate of 5.5%. Gross state product per capita in the Northern Territory ($72,496) is higher than any Australian state or territory and is also higher than the gross domestic product per capita for Australia ($54,606).\\r\\nThe Northern Territory's exports were up 12.9% or $681 million in 2012-13. The largest contributor to the territory's exports was: mineral fuels (largerly LNG), crude materials (mainly mineral ores) and food and live animals (primarily live cattle). The main international markets for Territory exports are Japan, China, Indonesia, the United States and Korea.[28]\\r\\nImports to the Northern Territory totalled $2,887.8 million which consisted of mainly machinery and equipment manufacturing (58.4%) and petroleum, coal, chemical and associated product manufacturing (17.0%).[29]\\r\\nThe principal mining operations are bauxite at Gove Peninsula where the production is estimated to increase 52.1% to $254 million in 2007ÿ08, manganese at Groote Eylandt, production is estimated to increase 10.5% to $1.1 billion which will be helped by the newly developed mines include Bootu Creek and Frances Creek, gold which is estimated to increase 21.7 per cent to $672 million at the Union Reefs plant and uranium at Ranger Uranium Mine.[30]\\r\\nTourism is an important economic driver for the Territory and a significant industry in regional areas.[31] Iconic destinations such as Uluru and Kakadu make the Northern Territory a popular destination for domestic and international travellers. Diverse landscapes, waterfalls, wide open spaces, aboriginal culture and wild and untamed wildlife provides the opportunity for visitors to immerse themselves in the natural wonder that the Northern Territory offers. In 2015, the Territory received a total of about 1.6 million domestic and international visitors contributing an estimated $2.0 billion to the local economy. Holiday visitors made up the majority of total visitation (about 792,000 visitors).\\r\\nTourism has strong links to other sectors in the economy including accommodation and food services, retail trade, recreation and culture, and transport.[32]\\r\\nThe Territory's current marketing campaign is 'Do the NT'.\\r\\nThe Northern Territory is the most sparsely populated state or territory in Australia. From its establishment in 1869 the Port of Darwin was the major Territory supply for many decades. It was damaged in the 1942 Japanese air raids and subsequently restored. In the late 1960s improved roads in adjoining States linking with the Territory, port delays and rapid economic development led to uncertainty in port and regional infrastructure development. As a result of the Commission of Enquiry established by the Administrator,[33] port working arrangements were changed, berth investment deferred and a port masterplan prepared.[34] Extension of rail transport was then not considered because of low freight volumes.\\r\\nToday the NT has a well connected network of sealed roads, including two National Highways, linking with adjoining States and connecting the major Territory population centres, and other important centres such as Uluru (Ayers Rock), Kakadu and Litchfield National Parks. The Stuart Highway, once known as \\"The Track\\", runs north to south, connecting Darwin and Alice Springs to Adelaide. Some of the sealed roads are single lane bitumen. Many unsealed (dirt) roads connect the more remote settlements.\\r\\nThe AdelaideÿDarwin railway, a new standard gauge railway, connects Adelaide via Alice Springs with Darwin, replacing earlier narrow gauge railways which had a gap between Alice Springs and Birdum. The Ghan passenger train runs from Darwin to Adelaide, stopping at Katherine, Tennant Creek, Alice Springs and Kulgera in the NT.\\r\\nThe Northern Territory is one of the few remaining places in the world with no speed restrictions on select public roads. On 1 January 2007 a default speed limit of 110?km/h was introduced on roads outside of urban areas (Inside urban areas of 40, 50 or 60?km/h). Speeds of up to 130?km/h are permitted on some major highways, such as the Stuart Highway.[35] On 1 February 2014, the speed limit was removed on a 204?km portion of the Stuart Highway for a one-year trial period.[36]Darwin International Airport is the major domestic and international airport for the territory. Several smaller airports are also scattered throughout the Territory and are served by smaller airlines; including Alice Springs Airport, Ayers Rock Airport, Katherine Airport and Tennant Creek Airport.\\r\\nThe Northern Territory has only one daily tabloid newspaper, News Corporation's Northern Territory News, or NT News. The Sunday Territorian is the sister paper to the NT News and is the only dedicated Sunday tabloid newspaper in the Northern Territory.\\r\\nThe Centralian Advocate is circulated around the Alice Springs region twice a week. There are also five weekly community newspapers. The Territory receives the national daily, The Australian, while the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and the Guardian Weekly are also available in Darwin. Katherine's paper is the Katherine Times.\\r\\nMetropolitan Darwin has had five broadcast television stations:\\r\\nDarwin also has a single open-narrowcast station:\\r\\nRegional Northern Territory has a similar availability of stations:\\r\\nRemote areas are generally required to receive television via the Viewer Access Satellite Television service, which carries the same channels as the regional areas, as well as some extra open-narrowcast services, including Indigenous Community Television and Westlink\\r\\nDarwin has radio stations on both AM and FM frequencies. ABC stations include ABC NewsRadio (102.5FM), 105.7 ABC Darwin (8DDD 105.7FM), ABC Radio National (657AM), ABC Classic FM (107.3FM) and Triple J (103.3FM). The 2 commercial stations are: Mix 104.9 (8MIX), Hot 100 (8HOT)\\r\\nThe leading community stations are 104.1 Territory FM, and Radio Larrakia (8KNB).\\r\\nThe radio stations in Alice Springs are also broadcast on the AM and FM frequencies. ABC stations include Triple J (94.9FM), ABC Classic FM (97.9FM), 783 ABC Alice Springs (783AM) and ABC Radio National (99.7FM). There are two community stations in the town--CAAMA (100.5FM) and 8CCC (102.1FM). The commercial stations, which are both owned by the same company are Sun 96.9 (96.9FM) and 8HA (900AM). Two additional stations, Territory FM (98.7FM) and Radio TAB (95.9FM) are syndicated from Darwin and Brisbane respectively.","input":"What is the population of northern territory 2017?"},{"output":"eleven","context":"Halloween is an American horror franchise that consists of eleven films, as well as novels, comic books, merchandise, and a video game.

Michael Myers is the antagonist in all of the films except Halloween III: Season of the Witch, the story of which has no direct connection to any other film in the series. In 2007, writer-director Rob Zombie made a remake of the 1978 film. A direct sequel to the 2007 remake was released two years later. A direct sequel to the original film that ignores all other films in the franchise was released on October 19, 2018. It was the highest grossing film in the franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe films collectively grossed over $366 million at the box-office worldwide. The film series is ranked second at the United States box officein adjusted 2008 dollarswhen compared to other American horror series. Both the original film and the 2018 sequel have received critical praise, while the other films have received mixed or negative reviews.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Halloween (1978), co-written and directed by John Carpenter, tells the story of Michael Myers as he stalks and kills teenage babysitters on Halloween night. The film begins with six-year-old Michael (Will Sandin) killing his older sister Judith (Sandy Johnson) on Halloween night 1963 in the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is subsequently hospitalized at Warren County's Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Fifteen years later, Michael (Nick Castle and Tony Moran) escapes from Smith's Grove and returns to his hometown where he stalks Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends as they babysit. The film ends with Michael being shot six times by his psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence).[2] Halloween II (1981) picks up where the events of Halloween left off. Michael's body is missing from the front lawn, where he fell when Loomis shot him. Michael follows Laurie to the local hospital, killing everyone who gets between him and Laurie. The story reveals that Laurie is actually Michael's sister: she was given up for adoption as an infant. Michael corners Loomis and Laurie in an operating room, where Loomis causes an explosion as Laurie escapes. Michael, engulfed in flames, stumbles out of the room before finally falling dead.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Myers does not appear in Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982). This installment follows the story of Dr. Challis (Tom Atkins) as he tries to solve the mysterious murder of a patient in his hospital. He, along with the patient's daughter Ellie (Stacey Nelkin), travels to the small town of Santa Mira, California. The pair discover that Silver Shamrock Novelties, a company run by Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy), is attempting to use the mystic powers of the Stonehenge rocks to resurrect the ancient aspects of the Celtic festival, Samhain, which Cochran connects to witchcraft. Cochran is using his Silver Shamrock Halloween masks to achieve his goal, which will be achieved when all the children wearing his masks watch the Silver Shamrock commercial airing Halloween night. Challis contacts the television stations and convinces all but one of the station managers to remove the commercial. The film ends with Challis screaming for the final station to turn off the commercial.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nHalloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988), as the title suggests, features the return of Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) to the film series. It is revealed that Michael survived the fire in Halloween II but has been comatose since that night. While being transferred back to Smith's Grove, Michael awakens upon hearing that Laurie Strode, who died in a car accident, has a daughter, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris). Michael escapes and makes his way to Haddonfield in search of his niece Jamie. Fellow survivor Dr. Loomis goes to Haddonfield after learning that Michael has escaped transfer. Eventually, the police track Michael down and shoot him several times before he falls down a mine shaft.[5] Picking up directly where the previous film ends, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989) has Michael (Don Shanks) surviving the gunshots, and the fall down the mine; he stumbles upon a hermit who bandages him up. One year later, and showing signs of a metaphysical connection to Jamie, Michael tracks Jamie to a local child mental health clinic. Using Jamie as bait, Loomis manages to capture Michael. The film ends with Michael being taken into police custody, only to be broken out of jail by a mysterious stranger, all dressed in black.[6] Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) picks up the story approximately six years after the events of The Revenge of Michael Myers. The mysterious stranger who broke Michael out of jail kidnaps Jamie Lloyd (J. C. Brandy) in an effort to obtain her child. Jamie escapes with her newborn son, with Michael (George P. Wilbur) in pursuit. Michael kills Jamie and continues searching for her baby; the infant is found by Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd)the young boy who was babysat by Laurie Strode in the first filmwho brings it home for safety. It is revealed that Michael is driven by the Curse of Thorn, which forces a person to kill their entire family in order to save all of civilization. The mysterious stranger is revealed to be Dr. Loomis's colleague, Dr. Wynn (Mitchell Ryan), who is part of a group of people who protect the chosen individual so that they may complete their task. With the help of Kara Strode (Marianne Hagan), Laurie's adoptive cousin, Tommy keeps the infant from Michael, who slaughters Wynn and his followers. Michael is finally subdued by Tommy, who injects him with large quantities of tranquilizers inside the Smith's Grove Sanitarium. The film ends with Loomis walking back into the sanitarium to find Michael.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events that transpire between the fourth to sixth films are effectively ignored in 1998's Halloween H20: 20 Years Later. This film opens twenty years after the events of the second film. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has faked her own death so that she could go into hiding from her brother Michael. Now working as the head mistress of a private school under the name Keri Tate, Laurie continues to live in fear of her brother's return. Her own son, John (Josh Hartnett), attends school where she teaches. Laurie's fear becomes reality when Michael (Chris Durand) shows up at the school and begins killing John's friends and eventually he and Laurie come face-to-face. Laurie manages to get John and his girlfriend (Michelle Williams) to safety, but decides to return to the school to face Michael once and for all. Laurie succeeds in stopping Michael, but not satisfied until she knows that he is truly dead, Laurie steals his body and decapitates Michael, finally killing him.[8] Halloween: Resurrection (2002) picks up three years after H20, and reveals that Michael swapped clothes with a paramediccrushing the paramedic's larynx so that he could not talkand that was whom Laurie killed. Unable to deal with having killed an innocent man, and the fact that Michael was still out there, Laurie is committed to a mental institution. Michael (Brad Loree) shows up at the institution, but Laurie captures him. Her fear of making the same mistake twice gets the better of her, and when she attempts to remove Michael's mask he surprises and kills her. Michael travels back to his family home in Haddonfield, but finds a group of college students filming an Internet reality show. Michael proceeds to kill everyone, until he is finally electrocuted by the only surviving student, Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), and the show's creator Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes).[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nA remake of the original Halloween was released in 2007. This film focuses on the events that led Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) to kill his family. It also identifies Laurie as Michael's sister early on, which was something not done in the original 1978 film. On Halloween, Michael murders a school bully, his older sister and her boyfriend, as well as his mother's boyfriend. Committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, Michael closes himself off from everyone. Fifteen years later, Michael (Tyler Mane) escapes and heads to Haddonfield to find his younger sister, with his psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) in pursuit. Michael finds his sister living with the Strode family, and going by the name Laurie. After killing nearly all of her friends and family, Michael then kidnaps Laurie and attempts to explain to her that he is her brother through the use of a picture that he has kept of himself and her as an infant. Unable to understand, Laurie fights back; eventually, Laurie uses Loomis's gun to shoot Michael in the head.[10] In 2009, a sequel to the remake, titled Halloween II, picks up right where the latter leaves off and then jumps ahead one year. Here, Michael (Mane) is presumed dead, but resurfaces after a vision of his deceased mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) informs him that he must track Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) down so that they can \\"come home\\" together. In the film, Michael and Laurie have a mental link, with the two sharing visions of their mother.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter viewing John Carpenter's film Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) at the Milan Film Festival, independent film producer Irwin Yablans and financier Moustapha Akkad sought out Carpenter to direct for them a film about a psychotic killer stalking babysitters.[12] Carpenter and Debra Hill began drafting a story titled The Babysitter Murders, but the title was changed at Yablans' request, suggesting the setting be changed to Halloween night and naming it Halloween instead.[13] Moustapha Akkad fronted the $300,000 for the film's budget,[12] even though he was worried about the tight schedule, low budget, and Carpenter's limited experience as a filmmaker. He finally decided to finance the film after Carpenter relayed the entire film to Akkad, \\"in a suspenseful way, almost frame for frame\\", and opted not to take any fees for directing the film.[13] The low budget forced wardrobe and props to be crafted from items on hand or that could be purchased inexpensively; this included the trademark mask worn by Michael Myers throughout the film. Production designer, art director, location scout and co-editor Tommy Lee Wallace created Michael's mask from a William Shatner Halloween mask, purchased for $1.98.[12] The limited budget also dictated the filming location and time schedule. Halloween was filmed in 21 days in the spring of 1978 primarily in South Pasadena, California. An abandoned house owned by a church stood in as the Myers house. Two homes on Orange Grove Avenue in Hollywood were used for the film's climax.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the success of Halloween, Yablans and Akkad began working on Halloween II. There was initial discussion about filming Halloween II in 3-D, but the idea never came to fruition. After Halloween II was released, Carpenter and Hill were approached about creating a third Halloween film, but they were reluctant to pledge commitment. The pair agreed to participate in the new project only if it was not a direct sequel to Halloween II, which meant no Michael Myers.[16] Most of the filming for Halloween III took place on location in the small coastal town of Loleta in Humboldt County, California. Familiar Foods, a milk bottling plant in Loleta, served as the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory, but all special effects involving fire, smoke, and explosions were filmed at Post Studios.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Halloween III was released, Michael Myers was brought back into the franchise with 1988's The Return of Michael Myers, where he has stayed for the remainder of the series. Four more sequels would follow, between 1988 and 2002, before the series would take a break for five years. On June 4, 2006, Dimension Films announced that Rob Zombie, director of House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, would be creating the next installment in the Halloween franchise. Bob Weinstein approached Rob Zombie about making the film, and Zombie, who was a fan of the original Halloween and friend of John Carpenter, jumped at the chance to make a Halloween film for Dimension Films.[18] Before Dimension went public with the news, Zombie felt obligated to inform John Carpenter, out of respect, of the plans to remake his film.[19] Carpenter's request was for Zombie to \\"make it his own [film]\\".[20] Zombie's film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept, with considerable original content in the new film.[21] Zombie also wanted to reinvent the character, as he felt Michael, along with Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Pinhead, had become too familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary.[22] Zombie delved deeper into Michael Myers's mythology. Michael's mask was even given its own story to provide an explanation as to why he wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film.[23] Zombie wanted to bring Michael closer to what a psychopath really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, a sequel to the 2007 remake was announced, with French filmmakers Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo in negotiations to direct.[24] Instead, Zombie was resigned to write and direct the sequel, with the film taking place directly after the end of his remake.[25] In an interview, Zombie expressed how the exhaustion of creating the first Halloween made him not want to come back for a sequel, but after a year of cooling down he was more open to the idea. The writer/director explains that with the sequel, he was no longer bound by a sense of needing to retain any \\"John Carpenter-ness\\", as he could now do \\"whatever [he] wants to do\\".[26] Instead of focusing on Michael, Zombie chose to look more at the psychological consequences on Laurie after the events of the remake. As Zombie explains, after Michael murdered her friends and family, Laurie became a \\"wreck\\", who continually sinks lower as the film moves forward.[27] Rob Zombie declined to return to film the second sequel to the 2007 remake.[28] The second sequel, Halloween 3D, was cancelled in 2012.[29][30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nA new effort to make a Halloween film, Halloween Returns, was attempted in 2015, unrelated to the Rob Zombie films. This ultimately failed and was cancelled when Dimension Films lost the rights to the Halloween franchise.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 23, 2016, it was reported that Miramax and Blumhouse Productions were developing a new Halloween film, which they would co-finance. On February 9, 2017, John Carpenter announced that a new Halloween film was going to be written by David Gordon Green and Danny McBride and will be directed by Green.[32] The film will be a direct sequel to the original Halloween and will ignore all of the franchise's previous sequels.[33][34][35]  In September 2017, Jamie Lee Curtis confirmed that she would reprise her role as Laurie Strode. In October 2017, Judy Greer entered negotiations to play Laurie's daughter Karen Strode.[36] In December 2017, it was announced Andi Matichak had signed on to play Karen Strode's daughter and Laurie's granddaughter.[37] The film will be distributed by Universal Pictures, their first involvement in the franchise since distributing 1982's Halloween III: Season of the Witch. On October 17, 2017, Carpenter announced that he would be returning to score the upcoming film, saying, \\"I'll be consulting with the director to see what he feels. I could create a new score, we could update the old score and amplify it, or we could combine those two things. I'll have to see the movie to see what it requires.\\"[38] On December 20, 2017, it was announced that Nick Castle would be reprising his role as Michael Myers.[39] Filming began on January 13, 2018,[40] concluding on February 19, 2018.[41] The film was released on October 19, 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Carpenter composed the music to the first three films. For Halloween, Carpenter chose to use a piano melody played in a 5/4 time rhythm instead of a symphonic soundtrack. Critic James Berardinelli calls the score \\"relatively simple and unsophisticated\\", but admits that \\"Halloween's music is one of its strongest assets.\\"[42] Carpenter stated in an interview, \\"I can play just about any keyboard, but I can't read or write a note.\\"[13] In the end credits, Carpenter bills himself as the \\"Bowling Green Orchestra\\" for performing the film's score, but he did receive assistance from composer Dan Wyman, a music professor at San Jose State University.[12][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe score for Halloween II is a variation of John Carpenter's compositions from the first film, particularly the main theme's familiar piano melody played. The score was performed on a synthesizer organ rather than the piano used for Halloween.[44] One reviewer for the BBC described the revised score as having \\"a more Gothic feel\\". The reviewer asserted that it \\"doesn't sound quite as good as the original piece\\", but \\"it still remains a classic piece of music\\".[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic remained an important element in establishing the atmosphere of Halloween III. Just as in Halloween and Halloween II, there was no symphonic score.[46] Much of the music was composed to solicit \\"false startles\\" from the audience.[47] The soundtrack was composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth, who had also worked on the score for Halloween II. The score of Halloween III differed greatly from the familiar main theme of the original and its first sequel. Carpenter replaced the familiar piano melody with a slower, electronic theme played on a synthesizer with beeping tonalities.[48] Howarth explains how he and Carpenter composed the music for the third film:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music style of John Carpenter and myself has further evolved in this film soundtrack by working exclusively with synthesizers to produce our music. This has led to a certain procedural routine. The film is first transferred to a time coded video tape and synchronized to a 24 track master audio recorder; then while watching the film we compose the music to these visual images. The entire process goes quite rapidly and has 'instant gratification', allowing us to evaluate the score in synch to the picture. This is quite an invaluable asset.[49]\\r\\nFollowing Carpenter's departure from the series, Howarth would stay on-board as the sole composer for the next two sequels, and also acted as the lead composer on Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, with Paul Rabjohns providing additional music when the initial edit of the film was substantially re-filmed.[50] While Halloween H20 credits John Ottman as its sole composer, in reality most of the soundtrack was provided by Scream composer Marco Beltrami, using a mixture of music from that film and a few original cues written by Beltrami, after the producers disliked Ottman's score.[51] Danny Lux provided the soundtrack for Halloween: Resurrection,[52] while Tyler Bates composed the soundtracks for both the 2007 Halloween reboot and its 2009 sequel.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Halloween franchise, when compared to the other top-grossing American horror franchisesA Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, Friday the 13th, the Hannibal Lecter series, Psycho, Saw, Scream, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacreand adjusting for 2017 inflation is the second highest-grossing horror franchise in the United States at approximately $814,8 million.[54] This list is topped by Friday the 13th at $825.1 million,[55] followed by the Nightmare on Elm Street series with $703.3 million.[56] The Hannibal Lecter film series closely follows in third with $737.6 million.[57] Following Halloween is the Saw series with $580.9 million,[58] Scream with $586.9 million,[59] Psycho with $554.4 million,[60] The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with $391 million,[61] and the Child's Play film series rounding out the list with $249.6 million.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nHalloween: 25 Years of Terror is a DVD released on July 25, 2006, featuring a documentary on the Halloween films, narrated by P. J. Soles and featuring interviews from many of the cast members as well as filmmakers of the Halloween films and a lot of footage from the series as well. It has panel discussions with members from the casts and crews of most of the Halloween films, plus other celebrities and filmmakers such as Rob Zombie and Clive Barker as well as film critics. All of the panel discussions took place at a 25th-year anniversary convention in Pasadena, California (one of the filming locations of the original Halloween) in October 2003. It also has extended versions of interviews featured in the documentary and much more. In 2010, The Biography Channel produced a television special titled Halloween: The Inside Story, which premiered on October 28, 2010.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the original Halloween was released in 1978, a novelization of the film followed just a year later. Written by Curtis Richards, the book follows the events of the film, but expands on the festival of Samhain and Michael's time at Smith's Grove Sanitarium.[77] Halloween II, Halloween III: Season of the Witch, and Halloween 4 each received novelizations as well. Jack Martin would write Halloween II, which was released alongside its film counterpart. Martin included an additional victim of Michael's in this novel.[78] Halloween IV, released in October 1988 and written by Nicholas Grabowsky, also followed the events of the film in which it was adapted from.[79] A novelization of the 2018 film by John Passarella will be released on October 23, 2018.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver a four-month period, Berkley Books published three young adult novels written by Kelly O'Rourke; the novels are original stories created by O'Rourke, with no direct continuity with the films.[81] The first, released on October 1, 1997, titled The Scream Factory, follows a group of friends who set up a haunted house attraction in the basement of Haddonfield City Hall, only to be stalked and killed by Michael Myers while they are there.[82] The Old Myers Place is the second novel, released December 1, 1997, and focuses on Mary White, who moves into the Myers house with her family. Michael returns home and begins stalking and attacking Mary and her friends.[83] O'Rourke's final novel, The Mad House, was released on February 1, 1998. The Mad House features a young girl, Christine Ray, who joins a documentary film crew that travels to haunted locations; they are currently headed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where they are confronted by Michael.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Halloween comic was published by Brian Pulido's Chaos! Comics. Simply titled Halloween, it was intended to be a one-issue special, but eventually two sequels spawned: Halloween II: The Blackest Eyes and Halloween III: The Devil's Eyes. All of the stories were written by Phil Nutman, with Daniel Farrandswriter for Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myersassisting on the first issue; David Brewer and Justiniano worked on the illustrations. Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues, focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers. The first issue includes back story on Michael's childhood, while the third picks up after the events of the film Halloween H20.[85] These comics were based on Daniel Farrand's concept for Halloween: Resurrection; he had been approached by the producers to pitch a follow-up to Halloween H20. His idea was to have Tommy Doyle incarcerated at Smith's Grove for Michael Myers' crimes, only to escape and reunite with Lindsay Wallace. Together, they study the journals of Dr. Loomis and find out more about Michael's childhood. The movie would have explored Michael's time at Smith's Grove and his relationship with Dr. Loomis, before returning to Tommy and Lindsay, who are attacked by the adult Michael Myers. Upon defeating him and removing his mask, they discover Laurie Strode, who has taken over her brother's mantle. Farrand's logic was that, since Jamie Lee Curtis was contracted to cameo in Halloween: Resurrection, they should make that cameo as significant and surprising as possible. Although the studio did not follow up on his pitch, Farrands was able to tell his story in comic book form.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne Good Scare was released in 2003; it was written by Stefan Hutchinson and illustrated by Peter Fielding. The main character in this comic is Lindsey Wallace, the young girl who first saw Michael Myers alongside Tommy Doyle in the original 1978 film. Hutchinson wanted to bring the character back to his roots, and away from the \\"lumbering Jason-clone\\" the film sequels had made him.[87] One Good Scare came about because Hutchinson wanted to produce a comic book to celebrate the series' twenty-fifth anniversary; it was to be sold as a collectible at a Halloween convention in South Pasadena. Due to the positive reception to One Good Scare, Hutchinson hoped to use the comic as a \\"demo\\" for getting a distribution deal, but was unable to do so due to rights issues.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile waiting to acquire the rights to publish more Halloween comics, Stefan Hutchinson worked on the documentary Halloween: 25 Years of Terror with Malek Akkad. Together, they developed ideas for possible Halloween stories that would be \\"connected into a larger tale, so the idea was that it would use the serial aspect of comic books to create different storylines than would be possible in the films.\\"[88] On July 25, 2006, as an insert inside the DVD release of Halloween: 25 Years of Terror, Hutchinson released Halloween: Autopsis. Written by Hutchinson, and artwork by Marcus Smith and Nick Dismas, the story is about a photographer assigned to take pictures of Michael Myers. As the photographer, Carter, follows Dr. Loomis he begins to take on Loomis's obsession himself, until finally meeting Michael Myers in person, which results in his death.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nRob Zombie's reboot of the film series ensured that any Halloween comics would not be contradicted by upcoming films, allowing Hutchinson creative freedom. Malek Akkad was approached by Devil's Due Publishing with the possibility of producing a line of Halloween comics, and he and Hutchinson worked to make them a reality. Hutchinson was convinced by the strong support of One Good Scare that the comic books would have an audience.[88] In 2008, Stefan Hutchinson released the first issue of his new comic book, Halloween: Nightdance. This is a four-issue miniseries, and it does not contain any charactersother than Michaelfrom the films.[90] The four issues are titled, \\"A Shape in the Void\\", \\"The Silent Clown\\", \\"A Rainbow in One Color\\", and \\"When the Stars Came Crashing Down\\".[91] The first issue, \\"A Shape in the Void\\", takes place on October 31, 2000, so that it falls between Halloween H20 and Halloween: Resurrection. Issue one follows Michael as he stalks Lisa, an eighteen-year-old girl with insecurities and \\"a chronic fear of darkness\\".[90] Hutchinson explains that Nightdance was an attempt to escape the dense continuity of the film series and recreate the tone of the 1978 film. Michael becomes inexplicably fixated on Lisa, just as he did with Laurie in the original Halloween, before the sequels established that a sibling bond was actually his motivation for stalking her.[92] The aim was to once again establish Michael Myers as a \\"credible and dangerous force\\".[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 2008 saw the release of Devil's Due's Halloween: 30 Years of Terror to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Halloween franchise. This comic book one-shot is a collection of short stories inspired by John Carpenter's original. \\"Trick or Treat\\" features the MacKenzies, unseen characters from the first film who Tommy and Lindsey run to for help. \\"P.O.V.\\" shows a murder from the point of view of both Michael and his victim, \\"Visiting Hours\\" sees Laurie Strode reflecting on how her life could have been had her brother never found her in 1978, while \\"Tommy and the Boogeyman\\" reveals that Tommy Doyle grew up to write comic books featuring Michael Myers. In the final story, \\"Repetition Compulsion\\", Dr. Loomis tries to predict where Michael will strike next on Halloween 1989. Writer Hutchinson explains that H30 came about because, unlike previous decades, there was no Halloween film coming out in 2008 to acknowledge the occasion.[93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nDevil's Due released the three-issue miniseries Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode in late 2008. Written by Hutchinson with artwork from Jeff Zornow, the story bridges the gap between Halloween II and Halloween H20 by focusing on Laurie Strode in the aftermath of the 1978 murders. Hutchinson explains that Laurie is \\"trying to get better and trying to repair, but where do you even start after going through such horror? How do you even try to resume normality when you don't know what that is anymore?\\" Although Michael appears in the series, it is not clear whether he is real or if the traumatised Laurie is seeing things. Hutchinson is not a fan of the revelation that Laurie and Michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in the story. He wanted to avoid the \\"bloodline plot of the middle sequels\\", which he felt demystified the character of the Shape, and approach the story so that \\"it becomes almost incidental that she's his sister\\". Hutchinson believed that Laurie Strode's evolution into Keri Tate was fertile ground for a storyline; he says, \\"it's not the faking of the death that's interesting at all, but it's the fall that leads to that happening. The faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence, but the state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential.\\"[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of Stefan Hutchinson's Halloween comic books take place in the Halloween H20 timeline, which retconned Halloween 4ÿ6 from continuity. Hutchinson comments that, while the retcon was unpopular with \\"a lot of fans\\" for ignoring previous movies, he preferred the \\"simplicity of this storyline, over the needlessly convoluted mythology that the last three films had created\\". However, he admits that one of the downsides of the H20 timeline is that fans do not know exactly what happened to Dr. Sam Loomis after Halloween II. To remedy this, Hutchinson pitched Halloween: Sam as a way of paying tribute to the character.[88] Written by Hutchinson and featuring illustrations from Autopsis' Marcus Smith, Sam is a prose short story available exclusively for download at the website HalloweenComics.com. It explores the life of Dr. Loomis, including his backstory and relationship with Elizabeth Worthington, a journalist he met during World War II. In 1995, Michael Myers visits the ailing Dr. Loomis in a hospital and murders Elizabeth in front of him. Loomis attempts to stop him, but dies of a coronary failure.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1983, Wizard Video, who had also released a video game version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, released a Halloween game for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player is a babysitter who has to protect her children from Michael Myers, who has managed to get inside the house. Although the game is called Halloween, and features the film's theatrical poster as its cover art as well as the movie's main music theme, the game itself never refers to any characters, including the killer, by their names in the film.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Halloween franchise has also seen profitability through various merchandise like toys, dolls, statues, model kits, bobbleheads, snow globes, movie posters, masks, T-shirts, hats, and more.

Daniel's jealous rivals trick Darius into issuing a decree that for thirty days no prayers should be addressed to any god or man but Darius himself; any who break this are to be thrown to the lions. Daniel continues to pray to the God of Israel, and the king, although deeply distressed, must condemn Daniel to death, for the edicts of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered.  Hoping for Daniel's deliverance, he has him cast into the pit. At daybreak the king hurries to the place and cries out anxiously, asking if God had saved his friend. Daniel replies that his God had sent an angel to close the jaws of the lions, \\"because I was found blameless before him.\\" The king commands that those who had conspired against Daniel should be thrown to the lions in his place, along with their wives and children, and writes to all the people of the whole world commanding that all should tremble and fear before the God of Daniel.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is generally accepted that the Book of Daniel originated as a collection of folktales among the Babylonian diaspora, the Jewish community living in Babylon and Mesopotamia in the Persian and Hellenistic periods (5th to 2nd centuries BC).[8] Chapters 4ÿ6, which includes the tale of Daniel in the lions' den, may belong to the earliest stage, as these differ quite markedly in the oldest texts.[9] Although the entire book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel the seer, the tales of chapters 1-6, including the story of the lion's den, are the voice of an anonymous narrator (except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar).[10] It is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nChapters 2-7 are in Aramaic, and are in the clear form of a chiasm (a poetic structure in which the main point or message of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by further repetitions on either side):[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of Daniel in the lions' den in chapter 6 is paired with the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and the \\"fiery furnace\\" in Daniel 3. The parallels include the jealousy of non-Jews, an imperial edict requiring Jews to compromise their religion on pain of death, and divine deliverance. Each story climaxes with the king confessing the greatness of the God of the Jews and issuing an edict of royal protection. In each case life is preserved through divine presence in the fire or the pit.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe structure of Daniel 6 itself is also in the form of a chiasm:[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Josippon, \\"the beasts in the den received Daniel as faithful dogs might receive their returning master, wagging their tails and licking him.\\"  The Midrash Tehillim says that \\"the mouth of the den was closed with a huge stone, which had rolled of itself from Palestine to Babylon for that purpose\\" and that \\"upon this stone sat an angel in the shape of a lion, so that Daniel's enemies might not harass him.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Daniel is sometimes depicted as a young man in illustrations of the incident, James Montgomery Boice points out that he would have been over eighty years old at the time.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nPainters who have depicted this incident include:","input":"Who was cast into the lion's den?"},{"output":"Tom Sawyer","context":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (or, in more recent editions, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) is a novel by Mark Twain, first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885. Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry \\"Huck\\" Finn, a friend of Tom Sawyer the narrator of two other Twain novels (Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective). It is a direct sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\\r\\nThe book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in a Southern antebellum society that had ceased to exist about 20 years before the work was published, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an often scathing satire on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism.\\r\\nPerennially popular with readers, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has also been the continued object of study by literary critics since its publication. The book was widely criticized upon release because of its extensive use of coarse language. Throughout the 20th century, and despite arguments that the protagonist and the tenor of the book are anti-racist,[2][3] criticism of the book continued due to both its perceived use of racial stereotypes and its frequent use of the racial slur \\"nigger\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order of appearance:\\r\\nThe story begins in fictional St. Petersburg, Missouri (based on the actual town of Hannibal, Missouri), on the shore of the Mississippi River \\"forty to fifty years ago\\" (the novel having been published in 1884). Huckleberry \\"Huck\\" Finn (the protagonist and first-person narrator) and his friend, Thomas \\"Tom\\" Sawyer, have each come into a considerable sum of money as a result of their earlier adventures (detailed in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer). Huck explains how he is placed under the guardianship of the Widow Douglas, who, together with her stringent sister, Miss Watson, are attempting to \\"sivilize\\" him and teach him religion. Finding civilized life confining, his spirits are raised somewhat when Tom Sawyer helps him to escape one night past Miss Watson's slave Jim, to meet up with Tom's gang of self-proclaimed \\"robbers.\\" Just as the gang's activities begin to bore Huck, he is suddenly interrupted by the reappearance of his shiftless father, \\"Pap\\", an abusive alcoholic. Knowing that Pap would only spend the money on alcohol, Huck is successful in preventing Pap from acquiring his fortune; however, Pap kidnaps Huck and leaves town with him.\\r\\nPap forcibly moves Huck to his isolated cabin in the woods along the Illinois shoreline. Because of Pap's drunken violence and imprisonment of Huck inside the cabin, Huck, during one of his father's absences, elaborately fakes his own death, escapes from the cabin, and sets off downriver. He settles comfortably, on Jackson's Island. Here, Huck reunites with Jim, Miss Watson's slave. Jim has also run away after he overheard Miss Watson planning to sell him \\"down the river\\" to presumably more brutal owners. Jim plans to make his way to the town of Cairo in Illinois, a free state, so that he can later buy the rest of his enslaved family's freedom. At first, Huck is conflicted about the sin and crime of supporting a runaway slave, but as the two talk in depth and bond over their mutually held superstitions, Huck emotionally connects with Jim, who increasingly becomes Huck's close friend and guardian. After heavy flooding on the river, the two find a raft (which they keep) as well as an entire house floating on the river. Entering the house to seek loot, Jim finds the naked body of a dead man lying on the floor, shot in the back. He prevents Huck from viewing the corpse.\\r\\nTo find out the latest news in town, Huck dresses as a girl and enters the house of Judith Loftus, a woman new to the area. Huck learns from her about the news of his own supposed murder; Pap was initially blamed, but since Jim ran away he is also a suspect and a reward for Jim's capture has initiated a manhunt. Mrs. Loftus becomes increasingly suspicious that Huck is a boy, finally proving it by a series of tests. Once he is exposed, she nevertheless allows him to leave her home without commotion, not realizing that he is the allegedly murdered boy they have just been discussing. Huck returns to Jim to tell him the news and that a search party is coming to Jackson's Island that very night. The two hastily load up the raft and depart.\\r\\nAfter a while, Huck and Jim come across a grounded steamship. Searching it, they stumble upon two thieves discussing murdering a third, but they flee before being noticed. They are later separated in a fog, making Jim intensely anxious, and when they reunite, Huck tricks Jim into thinking he dreamed the entire incident. Jim is not deceived for long, and is deeply hurt that his friend should have teased him so mercilessly. Huck becomes remorseful and apologizes to Jim, though his conscience troubles him about humbling himself to a black man.\\r\\nTraveling onward, Huck and Jim's raft is struck by a passing steamship, again separating the two. Huck is given shelter on the Kentucky side of the river by the Grangerfords, an \\"aristocratic\\" family. He befriends Buck Grangerford, a boy about his age, and learns that the Grangerfords are engaged in a 30-year blood feud against another family, the Shepherdsons. The Grangerfords and Shepherdsons go to the same church, which ironically preaches brotherly love. The vendetta finally comes to a head when Buck's older sister elopes with a member of the Shepherdson clan. In the resulting conflict, all the Grangerford males from this branch of the family are shot and killed, including Buck, whose horrific murder Huck witnesses. He is immensely relieved to be reunited with Jim, who has since recovered and repaired the raft.\\r\\nNear the Arkansas-Missouri-Tennessee border, Jim and Huck take two on-the-run grifters aboard the raft. The younger man, who is about thirty, introduces himself as the long-lost son of an English duke (the Duke of Bridgewater). The older one, about seventy, then trumps this outrageous claim by alleging that he himself is the Lost Dauphin, the son of Louis XVI and rightful King of France. The \\"duke\\" and \\"king\\" soon become permanent passengers on Jim and Huck's raft, committing a series of confidence schemes upon unsuspecting locals all along their journey. To divert suspicions from the public away from Jim, they pose him as recaptured slave runaway, but later paint him up entirely blue and call him the \\"Sick Arab\\" so that he can move about the raft without bindings.\\r\\nOn one occasion, the swindlers advertise a three-night engagement of a play called \\"The Royal Nonesuch\\". The play turns out to be only a couple of minutes' worth of an absurd, bawdy sham. On the afternoon of the first performance, a drunk called Boggs is shot dead by a gentleman named Colonel Sherburn; a lynch mob forms to retaliate against Sherburn; and Sherburn, surrounded at his home, disperses the mob by making a defiant speech describing how true lynching should be done. By the third night of \\"The Royal Nonesuch\\", the townspeople prepare for their revenge on the duke and king for their money-making scam, but the two cleverly skip town together with Huck and Jim just before the performance begins.\\r\\nIn the next town, the two swindlers then impersonate brothers of Peter Wilks, a recently deceased man of property. To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an English accent and the duke pretends to be a deaf-mute while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. Huck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions\\"All right, then, I'll go to hell!\\"Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.\\r\\nHuck learns that Jim is being held at the plantation of Silas and Sally Phelps. The family's nephew, Tom, is expected for a visit at the same time as Huck's arrival, so Huck is mistaken for Tom and welcomed into their home. He plays along, hoping to find Jim's location and free him; in a surprising plot twist, it is revealed that the expected nephew is, in fact, Tom Sawyer. When Huck intercepts the real Tom Sawyer on the road and tells him everything, Tom decides to join Huck's scheme, pretending to be his own younger half-brother, Sid, while Huck continues pretending to be Tom. In the meantime, Jim has told the family about the two grifters and the new plan for \\"The Royal Nonesuch\\", and so the townspeople capture the duke and king, who are then tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail.\\r\\nRather than simply sneaking Jim out of the shed where he is being held, Tom develops an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read,[5] including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep and returned to the Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck is rewarded six hundred dollars for saving the aunts from the con men. Huck gives most of it to Jim for his family. Huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.\\r\\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn explores themes of race and identity. A complexity exists concerning Jim's character. While some scholars point out that Jim is good-hearted, moral, and he is not unintelligent (in contrast to several of the more negatively depicted white characters), others have criticized the novel as racist, citing the use of the word \\"nigger\\" and emphasizing the stereotypically \\"comic\\" treatment of Jim's lack of education, superstition and ignorance.[6][7]\\r\\nThroughout the story, Huck is in moral conflict with the received values of the society in which he lives, and while he is unable to consciously refute those values even in his thoughts, he makes a moral choice based on his own valuation of Jim's friendship and Jim's human worth, a decision in direct opposition to the things he has been taught. Mark Twain, in his lecture notes, proposes that \\"a sound heart is a surer guide than an ill-trained conscience\\" and goes on to describe the novel as \\"...a book of mine where a sound heart and a deformed conscience come into collision and conscience suffers defeat\\".[8][not in citation given]\\r\\nTo highlight the hypocrisy required to condone slavery within an ostensibly moral system, Twain has Huck's father enslave his son, isolate him, and beat him. When Huck escapes ÿ which anyone would agree was the right thing to do ÿ he then immediately encounters Jim \\"illegally\\" doing the same thing. The treatment both of them receive are radically different especially with an encounter with Mrs. Judith Loftus who takes pity on who she presumes to be a runaway apprentice, Huck, yet boasts about her husband sending the hounds after a runaway slave, Jim.[9]\\r\\nSome scholars discuss Huck's own character, and the novel itself, in the context of its relation to African-American culture as a whole. John Alberti quotes Shelley Fisher Fishkin, who writes in her 1990s book Was Huck Black?: Mark Twain and African-American Voices, \\"by limiting their field of inquiry to the periphery,\\" white scholars \\"have missed the ways in which African-American voices shaped Twain's creative imagination at its core.\\" It is suggested that the character of Huckleberry Finn illustrates the correlation, and even interrelatedness, between white and black culture in the United States.[10]\\r\\nThe original illustrations were done by E.W. Kemble, at the time a young artist working for Life magazine. Kemble was hand-picked by Twain, who admired his work. Hearn suggests that Twain and Kemble had a similar skill, writing that:\\r\\nWhatever he may have lacked in technical grace ... Kemble shared with the greatest illustrators the ability to give even the minor individual in a text his own distinct visual personality; just as Twain so deftly defined a full-rounded character in a few phrases, so too did Kemble depict with a few strokes of his pen that same entire personage.[11]\\r\\nAs Kemble could afford only one model, most of his illustrations produced for the book were done by guesswork. When the novel was published, the illustrations were praised even as the novel was harshly criticized. E.W. Kemble produced another set of illustrations for Harper's and the American Publishing Company in 1898 and 1899 after Twain lost the copyright.[12]\\r\\nTwain initially conceived of the work as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography. Twain worked on the manuscript off and on for the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and set it aside for several years. After making a trip down the Hudson River, Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade).[13]\\r\\nMark Twain composed the story in pen on notepaper between 1876 and 1883. Paul Needham, who supervised the authentication of the manuscript for Sotheby's books and manuscripts department in New York in 1991, stated, \\"What you see is [Clemens'] attempt to move away from pure literary writing to dialect writing\\". For example, Twain revised the opening line of Huck Finn three times. He initially wrote, \\"You will not know about me\\", which he changed to, \\"You do not know about me\\", before settling on the final version, \\"You don't know about me, without you have read a book by the name of 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'; but that ain't no matter.\\"[14] The revisions also show how Twain reworked his material to strengthen the characters of Huck and Jim, as well as his sensitivity to the then-current debate over literacy and voting.[15][16]\\r\\nA later version was the first typewritten manuscript delivered to a printer.[17]\\r\\nDemand for the book spread outside of the United States. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was eventually published on December 10, 1884, in Canada and the United Kingdom, and on February 18, 1885, in the United States.[18] The illustration on page 283 became a point of issue after an engraver, whose identity was never discovered, made a last-minute addition to the printing plate of Kemble's picture of old Silas Phelps, which drew attention to Phelps' groin. Thirty thousand copies of the book had been printed before the obscenity was discovered. A new plate was made to correct the illustration and repair the existing copies.[19][20]\\r\\nIn 1885, the Buffalo Public Library's curator, James Fraser Gluck, approached Twain to donate the manuscript to the library. Twain did so. Later it was believed that half of the pages had been misplaced by the printer. In 1991, the missing first half turned up in a steamer trunk owned by descendants of Gluck's. The library successfully claimed possession and, in 1994, opened the Mark Twain Room to showcase the treasure.[21]\\r\\nIn relation to the literary climate at the time of the book's publication in 1885, Henry Nash Smith describes the importance of Mark Twain's already established reputation as a \\"professional humorist\\", having already published over a dozen other works. Smith suggests that while the \\"dismantling of the decadent Romanticism of the later nineteenth century was a necessary operation,\\" Adventures of Huckleberry Finn illustrated \\"previously inaccessible resources of imaginative power, but also made vernacular language, with its new sources of pleasure and new energy, available for American prose and poetry in the twentieth century.\\"[22]\\r\\nWhile it was clear that the publication of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was controversial from the outset, Norman Mailer, writing in The New York Times in 1984, concluded that Twain's novel was not initially \\"too unpleasantly regarded.\\" In fact, Mailer writes: \\"the critical climate could hardly anticipate T. S. Eliot and Ernest Hemingway's encomiums 50 years later,\\" reviews that would remain longstanding in the American consciousness.[23]\\r\\nAlberti suggests that the academic establishment responded to the book's challenges both dismissively and with confusion. During Twain's time, and today, defenders of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn \\"lump all nonacademic critics of the book together as extremists and censors' thus equating the complaints about the book's coarseness' from the genteel bourgeois trustees of the Concord Public Library in the 1880s with more recent objections based on race and civil rights.\\"[10]\\r\\nUpon issue of the American edition in 1885 several libraries banned it from their shelves.[24] The early criticism focused on what was perceived as the book's crudeness. One incident was recounted in the newspaper the Boston Transcript:\\r\\nThe Concord (Mass.) Public Library committee has decided to exclude Mark Twain's latest book from the library. One member of the committee says that, while he does not wish to call it immoral, he thinks it contains but little humor, and that of a very coarse type. He regards it as the veriest trash. The library and the other members of the committee entertain similar views, characterizing it as rough, coarse, and inelegant, dealing with a series of experiences not elevating, the whole book being more suited to the slums than to intelligent, respectable people.[25]\\r\\nWriter Louisa May Alcott criticized the book's publication as well, saying that if Twain \\"[could not] think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them\\".[26][27]\\r\\nTwain later remarked to his editor, \\"Apparently, the Concord library has condemned Huck as 'trash and only suitable for the slums.' This will sell us another twenty-five thousand copies for sure!\\"\\r\\nIn 1905, New York's Brooklyn Public Library also banned the book due to \\"bad word choice\\" and Huck's having \\"not only itched but scratched\\" within the novel, which was considered obscene. When asked by a Brooklyn librarian about the situation, Twain sardonically replied:\\r\\nI am greatly troubled by what you say. I wrote 'Tom Sawyer' & 'Huck Finn' for adults exclusively, & it always distressed me when I find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them. The mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be washed clean. I know this by my own experience, & to this day I cherish an unappeased bitterness against the unfaithful guardians of my young life, who not only permitted but compelled me to read an unexpurgated Bible through before I was 15 years old. None can do that and ever draw a clean sweet breath again on this side of the grave.[28]\\r\\nMany subsequent critics, Ernest Hemingway among them, have deprecated the final chapters, claiming the book \\"devolves into little more than minstrel-show satire and broad comedy\\" after Jim is detained.[29] Although Hemingway declared, \\"All modern American literature comes from\\" Huck Finn, and hailed it as \\"the best book we've had\\", he cautioned, \\"If you must read it you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys  [sic]. That is the real end. The rest is just cheating.\\"[30][31] Pulitzer Prize winner Ron Powers states in his Twain biography (Mark Twain: A Life) that \\"Huckleberry Finn endures as a consensus masterpiece despite these final chapters\\", in which Tom Sawyer leads Huck through elaborate machinations to rescue Jim.[32]\\r\\nIn his introduction to The Annotated Huckleberry Finn, Michael Patrick Hearn writes that Twain \\"could be uninhibitedly vulgar\\", and quotes critic William Dean Howells, a Twain contemporary, who wrote that the author's \\"humor was not for most women\\". However, Hearn continues by explaining that \\"the reticent Howells found nothing in the proofs of Huckleberry Finn so offensive that it needed to be struck out\\".[33]\\r\\nMuch of modern scholarship of Huckleberry Finn has focused on its treatment of race. Many Twain scholars have argued that the book, by humanizing Jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery, is an attack on racism.[34] Others have argued that the book falls short on this score, especially in its depiction of Jim.[24] According to Professor Stephen Railton of the University of Virginia, Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.[35]\\r\\nIn one instance, the controversy caused a drastically altered interpretation of the text: in 1955, CBS tried to avoid controversial material in a televised version of the book, by deleting all mention of slavery and omitting the character of Jim entirely.[36]\\r\\nBecause of this controversy over whether Huckleberry Finn is racist or anti-racist, and because the word \\"nigger\\" is frequently used in the novel (a commonly used word in Twain's time which has since become vulgar and taboo), many have questioned the appropriateness of teaching the book in the U.S. public school systemthis questioning of the word \\"nigger\\" is illustrated by a school administrator of Virginia in 1982 calling the novel the \\"most grotesque example of racism I've ever seen in my life\\".[37] According to the American Library Association, Huckleberry Finn was the fifth most frequently challenged book in the United States during the 1990s.[38]\\r\\nThere have been several more recent cases involving protests for the banning of the novel. In 2003, high school student Calista Phair and her grandmother, Beatrice Clark, in Renton, Washington, proposed banning the book from classroom learning in the Renton School District, though not from any public libraries, because of the word \\"nigger\\". Clark filed a request with the school district in response to the required reading of the book, asking for the novel to be removed from the English curriculum. The two curriculum committees that considered her request eventually decided to keep the novel on the 11th grade curriculum, though they suspended it until a panel had time to review the novel and set a specific teaching procedure for the novel's controversial topics.[39]\\r\\nIn 2009, a Washington state high school teacher called for the removal of the novel from a school curriculum. The teacher, John Foley, called for replacing Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with a more modern novel.[40] In an opinion column that Foley wrote in the Seattle Post Intelligencer, he states that all \\"novels that use the N-word' repeatedly need to go.\\" He states that teaching the novel is not only unnecessary, but difficult due to the offensive language within the novel with many students becoming uncomfortable at \\"just hear[ing] the N-word.\\" He views this change as \\"common sense,\\" with Obama's election into office as a sign that Americans \\"are ready for a change,\\" and that by removing these books from the reading lists, they would be following this change.[41]\\r\\nPublishers of the book have made their own attempts at easing the controversy by way of less-coarse publications. A 2011 edition of the book, published by NewSouth Books, replaced the word \\"nigger\\" with \\"slave\\" (although being incorrectly addressed to a freed man) and did not use the term \\"Injun.\\" Mark Twain scholar Alan Gribben said he hoped the edition would be more friendly for use in classrooms, rather than have the work banned outright from classroom reading lists due to its language.[42]\\r\\nAccording to publisher Suzanne La Rosa \\"At NewSouth, we saw the value in an edition that would help the works find new readers. If the publication sparks good debate about how language impacts learning or about the nature of censorship or the way in which racial slurs exercise their baneful influence, then our mission in publishing this new edition of Twain's works will be more emphatically fulfilled.\\"[43] Another scholar, Thomas Wortham, criticized the changes, saying the new edition \\"doesn't challenge children to ask, 'Why would a child like Huck use such reprehensible language?'\\"[44]\\r\\nIn 2016, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was removed from a public school district in Virginia, along with the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, due to their use of racial slurs.[45][46]\\r\\nResponses to this include the publishing of The Hipster Huckleberry Finn which is an edition with the word \\"nigger\\" replaced with the word \\"hipster\\". The book's description includes this statement \\"Thanks to editor Richard Grayson, the adventures of Huckleberry Finn are now neither offensive nor uncool.\\"[47]","input":"What was first tom sawyer or huck finn?"},{"output":"916,542","context":"Pinellas County is a county located in the state of Florida.[3] As of the 2010 census, the population was 916,542.[4] The county is part of the TampaÿSt. PetersburgÿClearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.[3] Clearwater is the county seat,[5] and St. Petersburg is the largest city.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to European exploration and settlement the Pinellas peninsula, like all of Tampa Bay, was inhabited by the Tocobaga Indians, who built a town and large temple mound overlooking the bay in what is now Safety Harbor.

In 1528 Panfilo de Narvaez landed in Pinellas, and 10 years later Hernando de Soto is thought to have explored the Tampa Bay Area. By the early 18th century the Tocobaga had been virtually annihilated, having fallen victim to European diseases from which they had no immunity, as well as European conflicts. Later Spanish explorers named the area Punta Pi?al (Spanish for \\"Point of Pines\\" or \\"Piney Point\\"). After trading hands multiple times between the British and the Spanish, Spain finally ceded Florida to the United States in 1821, and in 1823 the U.S. Army established Fort Brooke (later Tampa).\\r\\nIn 1834 much of west central Florida, including the Pinellas peninsula (then known simply as West Hillsborough), was organized as Hillsborough County. The very next year Odet Philippe became the first permanent, non-native resident of the peninsula when he established a homestead near the site of the Tocobaga village in Safety Harbor. It was Philippe who first introduced both citrus culture and cigar-making to Florida.[7][8][9]\\r\\nAround the same time, the United States Army began construction of Fort Harrison, named after William Henry Harrison, as a rest post for soldiers from nearby Fort Brooke during the Second Seminole War. The new fort was located on a bluff overlooking Clear Water Harbor, which later became part of an early 20th-century residential development (now historic district) called Harbor Oaks. University of South Florida archaeologists excavated the site in 1977 after Alfred C. Wyllie discovered an underground ammunition bunker while digging a swimming pool on his estate. Clearwater would later become the first organized community on the peninsula as well as the site of its first post office.\\r\\nThe Armed Occupation Act, passed in 1842, encouraged further settlement of Pinellas, like all of Florida, by offering 160 acres (0.65?km2) to anyone who would bear arms and cultivate the land. Pioneer families like the Booths, the Coachmans, the Marstons, and the McMullens established homesteads in the area in the years following, planting more citrus groves and raising cattle. During the American Civil War, many residents fought for the Confederate States of America. Brothers James and Daniel McMullen [10] were members of the Confederate Cow Cavalry, driving Florida cattle to Georgia and the Carolinas to help sustain the war effort. John W. Marston served in the 9th Florida Regiment as a part of the Appomattox Campaign. Many other residents served in other capacities. Otherwise the peninsula had virtually no significance during the war, and the war largely passed the area by.[11]\\r\\nTarpon Springs became West Hillsborough's first incorporated city in 1887, and in 1888 the Orange Belt Railway was extended into the southern portion of the peninsula. Railroad owner Peter Demens named the town that grew near the railroad's terminus St. Petersburg in honor of his hometown. The town would incorporate in 1892. Other major towns in the county incorporated during this time were Clearwater (1891), Dunedin (1899), and Largo (1905).\\r\\nConstruction of Fort De Soto, on Mullet Key facing the mouth of Tampa Bay, was begun in 1898 during the SpanishÿAmerican War to protect Tampa Bay from potential invading forces. The fort, a subpost of Fort Dade on adjacent Egmont Key (which lies in the mouth of Tampa Bay), was equipped with artillery and mortar batteries.[12]\\r\\nEven into the early years of the 20th century, West Hillsborough had no paved roads, and transportation posed a major challenge. A trip to the county seat, across the bay in Tampa, was generally an overnight affair and the automobiles that existed on the peninsula at that time would frequently become bogged down in the muck after rainstorms. Angry at what was perceived as neglect by the county government, residents of Pinellas began a push to secede from Hillsborough. They succeeded, and on January 1, 1912 Pinellas County came into being.[13][14] The peninsula, along with a small part of the mainland were incorporated into the new county.\\r\\nAviation history was made in St. Petersburg on January 1, 1914 when Tony Jannus made the world's first scheduled commercial airline flight with the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line from St. Petersburg to Tampa. The popular open-air St. Petersburg concert venue Jannus Live (formerly known as \\"Jannus Landing\\") memorializes the flight.\\r\\nThe early 1920s saw the beginning of a land boom in much of Florida, including Pinellas. During this period municipalities issued a large number of bonds to keep pace with the needed infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The travel time to Tampa was cut in halffrom 43 to 19 miles (69 to 31?km)by the opening of the Gandy Bridge in 1924, along the same route Jannus' airline used. It was the longest automobile toll bridge in the world at the time.\\r\\nProhibition was unpopular in the area and the peninsula's countless inlets and islands became havens for rumrunners bringing in liquor from Cuba. Others distilled moonshine in the County's still plentiful woods.[15]\\r\\nAs was the case in much of Florida, the Great Depression came early to Pinellas with the collapse of the real estate boom in 1926. Local economies came into severe difficulties, and by 1930, St. Petersburg defaulted on its bonds. Only after World War II would significant growth return to the area. During the war, the area's tourist industry collapsed, but thousands of recruits came to the area when the U.S. military decided to use the area for training. Area hotels became barracks. The Vinoy Park Hotel was used as an Army training school. The area's women and girls participated in the war effort as well. Hundreds of girls from the area's most prominent families formed a group called the Bomb-a-Dears, holding dances, socializing with recruits, and selling war bonds.[16] After the war many of these same soldiers remembered their war time experience in Pinellas well, and returned as tourists or residents.\\r\\nWith the end of the Second World War, Pinellas would enter another period of rapid growth and development. In 1954 the original span of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge was opened, replacing earlier ferry service. By 1957 Clearwater was America's fastest growing city.\\r\\nThe Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council was founded by the late mayor of St. Petersburg, Herman Goldner, who sought without success during the 1960s to consolidate various municipalities and unincorporated areas in south Pinellas County. Each year the council presents its Herman Goldner Award for Regional Leadership.[17]\\r\\nTragedy struck on May 9, 1980, when the southbound span of the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge was struck by the freighter MV Summit Venture during a storm, sending over 1,200 feet (370?m) of the bridge plummeting into Tampa Bay. The collision caused ten cars and a Greyhound bus to fall 150 feet (46?m) into the water, killing 35 people.[18][19] The new bridge opened in 1987 and has since been listed as #3 of the \\"Top 10 Bridges\\" in the World by the Travel Channel.[20]\\r\\nThe county operates a 21-acre (8.5?ha) living history museum called Heritage Village containing more than 28 historic structures, some dating back to the 19th century, where visitors can experience what life was once like in Pinellas.\\r\\nPinellas County celebrated 100 years of existence on January 1, 2012.\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 608 square miles (1,570?km2), of which 274 square miles (710?km2) is land and 334 square miles (870?km2) (55.0%) is water.[21] It is the second-smallest county in Florida by land area, larger than only Union County. Pinellas forms a peninsula bounded on the west by the Gulf of Mexico and on the south and east by Tampa Bay. It is 38 miles (61?km) long and 15 miles (24?km) wide at its broadest point, with 587 miles (945?km) of coastline.[22]\\r\\nElevation in the county ranges from mean sea level to its highest natural point of 110 feet (34?m) near the intersection of SR 580 and Countryside Blvd. in Clearwater.[23] Due to its small size and high population, by the early 21st century Pinellas County has been mostly built out, with very little developable land left available. The county has maintained a fairly large system of parks and preserves that provide residents and visitors retreat from the city and a glimpse of the peninsula's original state.\\r\\nGeologically, Pinellas is underlain by a series of limestone formations, the Hawthorne limestone and the Tampa limestone. The limestone is porous and stores a large quantity of water. The Hawthorne formation forms a prominent ridge down the spine of the county, from east of Dunedin, south to the Walsingham area and east towards St. Petersburg.[24]\\r\\nThe 35 miles of beaches and dunes which make up the county's 11 barrier islands provide habitat for coastal species, serve as critical storm protection for the inland communities, and form the basis of the area's thriving tourism industry. The islands are dynamic, with wave action building some islands further up, eroding others, and forming entirely new islands over time. Though hurricanes are infrequent on this part of Florida's coast, they have had a major impact on the islands, with the Hurricane of 1848 forming John's Pass between Madeira Beach and Treasure Island, a hurricane in 1921 creating Hurricane Pass and cleaving Hog Island into Honeymoon and Caladesi Islands, and 1985's Hurricane Elena sealing Dunedin Pass to join Caladesi with Clearwater Beach.[25]\\r\\nBetween the barrier islands and the peninsula are several bodies of water, through which traverses a section of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. From north to south they are: St. Joseph Sound between the islands and Dunedin, Clearwater Harbor between Clearwater and Clearwater Beach, and Boca Ciega Bay in the southern third of the county. Connecting Clearwater Harbor to Boca Ciega Bay is a thin, approximately 3.5-mile (5.6?km) stretch of water known as The Narrows, which runs next to the town of Indian Shores.\\r\\nExtending from northeastern Boca Ciega Bay, Long Bayou separates Seminole from St. Petersburg near Bay Pines. Long Bayou once extended significantly farther up the peninsula until the northern portion was sealed off to create Lake Seminole. Extending further still from Long Bayou, the Cross Bayou Canal traverses the peninsula, crossing Pinellas Park in a northeasterly direction before emptying into Tampa Bay on the northwest side of St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport.\\r\\n[26]\\r\\nAnderson Park Panorama\\r\\nBrooker Creek Nature Preserve walkway\\r\\nView of Lake Tarpon from John Chestnut Park\\r\\nWall Springs View of St Joseph Sound from the old observation tower\\r\\nBoyd Hill Nature Preserve- A 245-acre park on the shores of Lake Maggiore in south St. Petersburg, operated by the city and featuring a nature center, bird-of-prey aviary, and over three miles of trails through a variety of ecosystems.[27]\\r\\nHillsborough County extends along the shipping channel into the Gulf of Mexico and actually separates Pinellas County from Manatee County.\\r\\nSeveral natural communities exist within the county, including areas of freshwater wetlands (dominated by bald cypresses and ferns), coastal mangrove swamps, sporadic hardwood hammocks (dominated by laurel oaks and live oaks, cabbage palms, and southern magnolias), low-lying, poorly drained pine flatwoods (dominated by longleaf pines and saw palmettos), and well-drained, upland sandhills (dominated by longleaf pines and turkey oaks) and sand pine scrub (dominated by sand pines, saw palmettos, and various oaks). Offshore ecosystems include the Tampa Bay estuary and numerous gulf seagrass beds. The county also maintains several artificial reefs\\r\\nNumerous bird species can be sighted in Pinellas, either as permanent residents or during the winter migration, including wading birds like great blue herons, egrets, white ibises and roseate spoonbills, aquatic birds like brown pelicans, white pelicans, and cormorants, numerous species of shorebirds, and very-common birds like seagulls and passerines like the blue jay, mockingbird, and crow. Ospreys are a commonly seen bird-of-prey, with other birds of prey like turkey vultures, red tailed hawks, great horned owls, screech owls, barn owls, and bald eagles, among others, seen as well.\\r\\nGopher tortoises are found in many areas, the burrows they dig making them a keystone species. Coyotes, though often associated with the American West, are native-to and can be found in Pinellas. White-tailed deer, wild turkeys, bobcats, otters, and alligators can be found in the county as well.\\r\\nSea turtles nest on the shores or Pinellas' barrier islands and have been threatened by development. Offshore, dolphins, sharks, and manatees are numerous as well, while closer inshore stingrays are a common sight, leading those in-the-know to do the \\"stingray shuffle\\" (shuffling up the sand to scare nearby stingrays off) when entering gulf waters. Species of fish commonly caught in the waters surrounding the county include spotted seatrout, red drum or redfish, snook, pompano, sheepshead, Spanish mackerel, grouper, mullet, flounder, kingfish, and tarpon.\\r\\nLike much of Florida, Pinellas County is home to several invasive species that propagate easily outside their (and their natural predators') native range. Examples of commonly seen invasives include Brazilian pepper, water hyacinth, Australian pine, melaleuca and air potato. These species are considered serious pests, and varying methods have been tried to eradicate them. Examples of invasive animals include the wild boar, which poses significant health and agricultural problems in Florida and can sometimes be found in Pinellas, and the monk parakeet, small flocks of which can sometimes be seen in flight or building nests on electrical poles or telecommunications towers.[28]\\r\\nPinellas gained some national attention as the home of the Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay, a non-native, feral rhesus macaque that had been on the loose for approximately three years in the south of the county. No one was sure where the monkey came from, and a Facebook page set up for the monkey had over 84,000 likes (as of October 2012). The monkey was the subject of a sketch on the March 11, 2010 episode of the Colbert Report. As of February 2012, the monkey had apparently taken up semi-permanent residence behind a family's home at an undisclosed location in St. Petersburg, according to the Tampa Bay Times.[29] Efforts to capture the monkey were reignited after it reportedly bit a woman living near where it had taken up residence, and the monkey was captured in late October 2012 and eventually was sent to live at Dade City's Wild Things, a 22-acre (8.9?ha) zoo north of Tampa.\\r\\nPinellas, like the rest of the Tampa Bay area, has a humid subtropical climate, resulting in warm, humid summers with frequent thunderstorms, and drier winters. Pinellas County's geographic position- lying on a peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere and serves to moderate temperatures. The geography of the peninsula also causes some variance in the county's average temperatures. St. Petersburg, further south on the peninsula, tends to have warmer daily average lows (by about 3 degrees) than areas such as Dunedin and Palm Harbor further north, though daily highs are very close. The north of the county also has fewer overall days of rain, but higher total annual precipitation when measured in inches, the county's south being prone to shorter, more frequent thunderstorms especially in the late summer.\\r\\nFreezing temperatures occur only every 2ÿ3 years, with freezing precipitation occurring extremely rarely. Springs are usually short, mild, and dry, with occasional late-season cold fronts. Summertime weather is very consistent, with highs in the low 90s F (around 32?C), lows in the mid-70s F (around 24?C), accompanied by high humidity and an almost daily chance of afternoon thundershowers. The area experiences significant rainfall during its summer months (approximately May through October), with nearly two-thirds of annual precipitation falling between the months of June and September. The area is occasionally affected by tropical storms and hurricanes, but has not suffered a direct hit since 1921. Fall, like spring, is usually mild and dry, with the hurricane season extending through November and sometimes affecting the area.\\r\\nMany portions of south Pinellas, especially near the bay and gulf, have tropical microclimates. Tropical trees such as coconut palms and royal palms and fruit trees like mangoes grow very well in these microclimates.\\r\\nU.S. Census Bureau 2010 Ethnic/Race Demographics:[37][38]\\r\\nIn 2010, 6.5% of the population considered themselves to be of only \\"American\\" ancestry (regardless of race or ethnicity.)[37]\\r\\nThere were 415,876 households out of which 19.89% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.33% were married couples living together, 11.86% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.67% were non-families. 35.42% of all households were made up of individuals and 15.14% (4.53% male and 10.61% female) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Males had a median income of $32,264 versus $26,281 for females. The per capita income for the county was $23,497. About 6.70% of families and 10.00% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.90% of those under age 18 and 8.20% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nIn 2000, as Florida's 6th and the nation's 53rd most populous county, Pinellas has a population greater than that of the individual states of Wyoming, Montana, Delaware, South Dakota, Alaska, North Dakota, and Vermont, as well as the District of Columbia. With a population density (as of the 2000 Census) of 3292 persons/mi2, Pinellas county is by far the most densely populated county in the state, more than double that of Broward County, the next most densely populated.[44]\\r\\nAs of 2010, 87.17% of all residents spoke English as their first language, while 5.56% spoke Spanish, 0.78% Vietnamese, 0.70% French, 0.65% Greek, 0.56% German, and 0.52% of the population spoke Serbo-Croatian as their mother language.[45] In total, 12.83% of the population spoke languages other than English as their primary language.[45]\\r\\nThe Board of County Commissioners governs all unincorporated areas of the county under the state's constitution, with the power to adopt ordinances, approve the county budget, set millages, and provide services. The county's municipalities, while governing their own affairs, may call upon the county for specialized services.[46] The county administrator, appointed by and reporting to the Board, oversees most of the day-to-day operations of the county.[47]\\r\\nAs of 2013, The members of the Board of County Commissioners are as follows:\\r\\nThe county's government website won a \\"Sunny Award\\" in 2010 for its proactive disclosure of government data from Sunshine Review.[48]\\r\\nIn national politics, Pinellas County, as part of the I-4 Corridor stretching from Tampa Bay to Orlando, was one of the first areas of Florida to turn Republican. However, for the last quarter-century, it has been a powerful swing county in one of the nation's most critical swing states. It is closely divided between predominantly liberal St. Petersburg and its predominantly suburban and conservative north and beaches. In the 2012 Presidential Election, Barack Obama won Pinellas with 52% of the vote (239,104 votes) to Mitt Romney's 46.5% (213,258 votes), slightly narrower than Obamas 2008 election results in Pinellas of 53% (248,299 votes) to John McCains 45% (210,066 votes). In 2004 Pinellas swung the other way, with George W. Bush winning a narrow plurality of 49.56% (225,686 votes) and John Kerry following closely behind with 49.51% (225,460 votes).[49]\\r\\nIn the 2012 U.S. Senate election, Pinellas voters helped re-elect U.S. Senator Bill Nelson over challenger Connie Mack IV with 59% of the vote, greater than his statewide average of 55%. In the 2010 Senate Election, Pinellas was one of only four Florida counties won by outgoing Republican Governor Charlie Crist, a St. Petersburg native, who won 42% of Pinellas voters running as an Independent in a three-way race with Republican nominee (and eventual winner) Marco Rubio and former Democratic U.S. Representative Kendrick Meek, who won 37% and 16.8% of the Pinellas vote, respectively. Statewide, Rubio won almost 49% of the vote to Crist's 29.7% and Meek's 20%[51] in a highly polarized election that would witness Crist depart from the Republican Party and eventually become a Democrat.[52]\\r\\nPortions of Pinellas fall into Florida's 12th and 13th congressional districts, served by Republican Gus Bilirakis and Democrat Crist. A court-ordered remap merged most of the 14th's share of Pinellas into the 13th, enabling Crist to defeat Republican incumbent David Jolly in the 2016 election, breaking a 62-year GOP hold on what is now the 13th.\\r\\nIn state politics, portions of Pinellas are represented in the Florida Senate by Democratic State Senator Arthenia Joyner (District 19) and Republican State Senators Jack Latvala (District 20) and Jeff Brandes (District 22). In the Florida House parts of the county are represented by Republicans James Grant (District 64), Chris Sprowls (District 65), Larry Ahern (District 66), Chris Latvala (District 67), and Kathleen Peters (District 69) and Democrats Dwight Dudley (District 68) and Darryl Rouson (District 70).\\r\\n[53]\\r\\nThe county is served by the Pinellas County School District. The current superintendent is Dr. Michael Grego.

A variety of species can be found at the sanctuary, which is open 365 days a year and is free to the public.\\r\\nOn Clearwater Beach is the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, a non-profit dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and release of injured marine animals and public education. CMA's best-known permanent resident, is Winter, a bottlenose dolphin who was rescued in December 2005 after having her tail caught in a crab trap. Her injuries sadly caused the loss of her tail; CMA successfully fitted Winter with a prosthetic tail which brought worldwide attention to the facility. Winter was the subject of the 2011 film Dolphin Tale, shot partially on location at CMA.\\r\\nOn the south end of Anclote Key, off of Tarpon Springs, is the Anclote Key Light, a lighthouse built in 1887.

The United States is the only Western country currently applying the death penalty,[2] one of 57 countries worldwide applying it, and was the first to develop lethal injection as a method of execution, which has since been adopted by five other countries.[3]\\r\\nThere were no executions in the United States between 1967 and 1977. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment statutes in Furman v. Georgia, reducing all death sentences pending at the time to life imprisonment.[4]\\r\\nSubsequently, a majority of states passed new death penalty statutes, and the court affirmed the legality of capital punishment in the 1976 case Gregg v. Georgia. Since then, more than 7,800 defendants have been sentenced to death;[5] of these, more than 1,400 have been executed,[6] 159 were exonerated before their execution,[7][8] and more than 2,900 are still on death row.[9] The death penalty is applied only for murder involving an \\"aggravating factor\\" such as multiple victims, rape, or robbery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded death sentence in the British North American colonies was carried out in 1608 on Captain George Kendall,[10] who was executed by firing squad[11] at the Jamestown colony for allegedly spying for the Spanish government.[12]\\r\\nThe Bill of Rights adopted in 1789 included the Eighth Amendment which prohibited cruel and unusual punishment. The Fifth Amendment was drafted with language implying a possible use of the death penalty, requiring a grand jury indictment for \\"capital crime\\" and a due process of law for deprivation of \\"life\\" by the government.[13] The Fourteenth Amendment adopted in 1868 also requires a due process of law for deprivation of life by any state.\\r\\nThe Espy file,[14] compiled by M. Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smykla, lists 15,269 people executed in the United States and its predecessor colonies between 1608 and 1991. From 1930 to 2002, there were 4,661 executions in the U.S., about two-thirds of them in the first 20 years.[15] Additionally, the United States Army executed 135 soldiers between 1916 and 1955 (the most recent).[16][17][18]\\r\\nThree states abolished the death penalty for murder during the 19th century: Michigan in 1846 (has never executed a prisoner since achieving statehood), Wisconsin in 1853 and Maine in 1887. Rhode Island is also a state with a long abolitionist background, having repealed the death penalty in 1852, though it was theoretically available for murder committed by a prisoner between 1872 and 1984.\\r\\nOther states which abolished the death penalty for murder before Gregg v. Georgia include: Minnesota in 1911, Vermont in 1964, Iowa and West Virginia in 1965 and North Dakota in 1973. Hawaii abolished the death penalty in 1948 and Alaska in 1957, both before their statehood. Puerto Rico repealed it in 1929 and the District of Columbia in 1981. Arizona and Oregon abolished the death penalty by popular vote in 1916 and 1964 respectively, but both reinstated it, again by popular vote, some years later: Arizona in 1918 and Oregon in 1978.[19] Puerto Rico and Michigan are the only two U.S. jurisdictions to have explicitly prohibited capital punishment in their constitutions: in 1952 and 1964, respectively.\\r\\nNevertheless, capital punishment continued to be used by a majority of states and the federal government for various crimes, especially murder and rape, from the creation of the United States up to the beginning of the 1960s. Until then, \\"save for a few mavericks, no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law\\", according to abolitionist Hugo Bedau.[20]\\r\\nThe possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the Supreme Court of the United States decided Trop v. Dulles in 1958, when the court said explicitly for the first time that the Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual clause must draw its meaning from the \\"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\\", rather than from its original meaning. Also in the 1932 case Powell v. Alabama, the court made the first step of what would be later be called \\"death is different\\" jurisprudence, when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court-appointed attorney in capital cases - a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963, with Gideon v. Wainwright.\\r\\nIn Furman v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases. The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia's death penalty statute, which featured a \\"unitary trial\\" procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment. The last pre-Furman execution was that of Luis Monge on June 2, 1967.\\r\\nIn a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of Byron White and Potter Stewart, expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases, but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and William O. Douglas worried explicitly about racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty. Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.\\r\\nThe Furman decision caused all death sentences pending at the time to be reduced to life imprisonment, and was described by scholars as a \\"legal bombshell\\".[4] The next day, columnist Barry Schweid wrote that it was \\"unlikely\\" that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States.[21]\\r\\nInstead of abandoning capital punishment, 37 states enacted new death penalty statutes that attempted to address the concerns of White and Stewart in Furman. Some states responded by enacting mandatory death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder. White had hinted that such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his Furman opinion. Other states adopted \\"bifurcated\\" trial and sentencing procedures, with various procedural limitations on the jury's ability to pronounce a death sentence designed to limit juror discretion.\\r\\nOn July 2, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Gregg v. Georgia[22] and upheld 7-2 a Georgia procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any mitigating factors exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty - either death or life in prison, either with or without parole. The same day, in Woodson v. North Carolina[23] and Roberts v. Louisiana,[24] the court struck down 5-4 statutes providing a mandatory death sentence.\\r\\nExecutions resumed on January 17, 1977, when Gary Gilmore went before a firing squad in Utah. Although hundreds of individuals were sentenced to death in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s, only ten people besides Gilmore (who had waived all of his appeal rights) were actually executed prior to 1984.\\r\\nIn 1977, the Supreme Court's Coker v. Georgia decision barred the death penalty for rape of an adult woman. Previously, the death penalty for rape of an adult had been gradually phased out in the United States, and at the time of the decision, Georgia and the U.S. Federal government were the only two jurisdictions to still retain the death penalty for that offense.\\r\\nIn the 1980 case Godfrey v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that murder can be punished by death only if it involves a narrow and precise aggravating factor.[25]\\r\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has placed two major restrictions on the use of the death penalty. First, the case of Atkins v. Virginia, decided on June 20, 2002,[26] held that the execution of intellectually disabled inmates is unconstitutional. Second, in 2005, the court's decision in Roper v. Simmons[27] struck down executions for offenders under the age of 18 at the time of the crime.\\r\\nIn the 2008 case Kennedy v. Louisiana, the court also held 5-4 that the death penalty is unconstitutional when applied to non-homicidal crimes against the person, including child rape. Only two death row inmates (both in Louisiana) were affected by the decision.[28] Nevertheless, the ruling came less than five months before the 2008 presidential election and was criticized by both major party candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.[29]\\r\\nIn 2004, New York and Kansas capital sentencing schemes were struck down by their respective state highest courts. Kansas successfully appealed the Kansas Supreme Court decision to the United States Supreme Court, who reinstated the statute in Kansas v. Marsh (2006), holding it did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The decision of New York Court of Appeals was based on the state constitution, making unavailable any appeal. The state lower house has since blocked all attempts to reinstate the death penalty by adopting a valid sentencing scheme.[30] In 2016, Delaware's death penalty statute was also struck down by its state supreme court.[31]\\r\\nIn 2007, New Jersey became the first state to repeal the death penalty by legislative vote since Gregg v. Georgia,[32] followed by New Mexico in 2009,[33][34] Illinois in 2011,[35] Connecticut in 2012,[36][37] and Maryland in 2013.[38] The repeals were not retroactive, but in New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland, governors commuted all death sentences after enacting the new law.[39] In Connecticut, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that the repeal must be retroactive. New Mexico is the only state with remaining death row inmates and no present death penalty statute.[40]\\r\\nNebraska's legislature also passed a repeal in 2015, but a referendum campaign gathered enough signatures to suspend it. Capital punishment was reinstated by popular vote on November 8, 2016. The same day, California's electorate defeated a proposal to repeal the death penalty, and adopted another initiative to speed up its appeal process.[41]\\r\\nSince Furman, 11 states have organized popular votes dealing with the death penalty through the initiative and referendum process. All resulted in a vote for reinstating it, rejecting its abolition, expanding its application field, specifying in the state constitution that it is not unconstitutional, or expediting the appeal process in capital cases.[19]\\r\\nFrom 1976 to January 1, 2017, there were 1,442 executions, of which 1,267 were by lethal injection, 158 by electrocution, 11 by gas inhalation, 3 by hanging, and 3 by firing squad.[42] Executions rose at a near-continuous pace until 1999, when it peaked at 98. After 1999, the number of executions lowered nearly every year, and the 20 executions in 2016 were the fewest since 1991.[6]\\r\\nThe death penalty was a notable issue during the 1988 presidential election. It came up in the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, when Bernard Shaw, the moderator of the debate, asked Dukakis, \\"Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [his wife] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\\" Dukakis replied, \\"No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.\\" Bush was elected, and many, including Dukakis himself, cite the statement as the beginning of the end of his campaign.[43]\\r\\nIn 1996, Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act to streamline the appeal process in capital cases. The bill was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, who had endorsed capital punishment during his 1992 presidential campaign.\\r\\nA study found that at least 34 of the 749 executions carried out in the U.S. between 1977 and 2001, or 4.5%, involved \\"unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner\\". The rate of these \\"botched executions\\" remained steady over the period.[44] A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics in the prisoner was insufficient to ensure unconsciousness.[45] Nonetheless, the Supreme Court ruled in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and again in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.[46]\\r\\nAggravating factors for seeking capital punishment of murder vary greatly among death penalty states. California has twenty-two;[47] New Hampshire has seven.[48] Some aggravating circumstances are nearly universal, such as robbery-murder, murder involving rape of the victim, and murder of an on-duty police officer.[49]\\r\\nSeveral states have included child murder to their list of aggravating factors, but the victim's age under which the murder is punishable by death varies. In 2011, Texas raised this age from six to ten.[50]\\r\\nIn some states, the high number of aggravating factors has been criticized on account of giving prosecutors too much discretion in choosing cases where they believe capital punishment is warranted. In California especially, an official commission proposed, in 2008, to reduce these factors to five (multiple murders, torture murder, murder of a police officer, murder committed in jail, and murder related to another felony).[51] Columnist Charles Lane went further, and proposed that murder related to a felony other than rape should no longer be a capital crime when there is only one victim killed.[52]\\r\\nThe opinion of the court in Kennedy v. Louisiana says that the ruling does not apply to \\"treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity, which are offenses against the State\\".[53]\\r\\nSince no one is on death row for such offenses, the court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of the death penalty applied for them.\\r\\nTreason, espionage and large-scale drug trafficking are all capital crimes under federal law. Treason is also punishable by death in six states (Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri). Vermont still has a pre-Furman statute providing the death penalty for treason despite removing capital punishment for murder in 1965.[54] Large-scale drug trafficking is punishable by death in two states (Florida and Missouri).[55] Aircraft hijacking is a capital crime in Georgia and Mississippi.\\r\\nThe legal administration of the death penalty in the United States typically involves five critical steps: (1) prosecutorial decision to seek the death penalty (2) sentencing, (3) direct review, (4) state collateral review, and (5) federal habeas corpus.\\r\\nClemency, through which the Governor or President of the jurisdiction can unilaterally reduce or abrogate a death sentence, is an executive rather than judicial process.[56]\\r\\nWhile judges in criminal cases can usually impose a harsher prison sentence than the one demanded by prosecution, the death penalty can be handed down only if the accuser has specifically decided to seek it.\\r\\nIn the decades since Furman, new questions have emerged about whether or not prosecutorial arbitrariness has replaced sentencing arbitrariness. A study by Pepperdine University School of Law published in Temple Law Review, surveyed the decision-making process among prosecutors in various states. The authors found that prosecutors' capital punishment filing decisions remain marked by local \\"idiosyncrasies\\", suggesting they are not in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court's directive. This means that \\"the very types of unfairness that the Supreme Court sought to eliminate\\" may still \\"infect capital cases\\". Wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria. California law, for example, has 22 \\"special circumstances\\", making nearly all premeditated murders potential capital cases.[57]\\r\\nA proposed remedy against prosecutorial arbitrariness is to transfer the prosecution of capital cases to the state attorney general.[58]\\r\\nOf the 31 states with the death penalty, 29 provide the sentence to be decided by a jury, and 28 require a unanimous sentence.\\r\\nHowever, the states differ on what happens if the penalty phase results in a hung jury:[59][60]\\r\\nThe first outcome is referred as the \\"true unanimity\\" rule, while the third has been criticized as the \\"single-juror veto\\" rule.[62]\\r\\nIn Alabama, the sentence is decided by the jury and at least 10 jurors must concur. A retrial happens if the jury deadlock.[63]\\r\\nNebraska is the only state in which the sentence is decided by a three-judge panel. If one of the judges on the panel opposes death, the defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment.[64] Montana is the only state where the trial judge decides the sentence alone.[65]\\r\\nIn all states in which the jury is involved, only death-qualified veniremen can be selected in such a jury, to exclude both people who will always vote for the death sentence and those who are categorically opposed to it.\\r\\nIf a defendant is sentenced to death at the trial level, the case then goes into a direct review.[66] The direct review process is a typical legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not.[67] Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand.[66] If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing.[68] Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible.[68] About 60 percent survive the process of direct review intact.[69]\\r\\nAt times when a death sentence is affirmed on direct review, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final.[70] Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state.[71] Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review.[72] Most often, these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.[73]\\r\\nIn Virginia, state habeas corpus for condemned men are heard by the state supreme court under exclusive original jurisdiction since 1995, immediately after direct review by the same court.[74] This avoids any proceeding before the lower courts, and is in part why Virginia has the shortest time on average between death sentence and execution (less than eight years) and has executed 113 offenders since 1976 with only five remaining on death row as of June 2017.[75][76]\\r\\nTo reduce litigation delays, other states require convicts to file their state collateral appeal before the completion of their direct appeal,[77] or provide adjudication of direct and collateral attacks together in a \\"unitary review\\".[78]\\r\\nAfter a death sentence is affirmed in state collateral review, the prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus, which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts. Federal habeas corpus is a type of collateral review, and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court (other than petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal constitutional rights. Prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling.[79] According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal habeas corpus.[73]\\r\\nJames Liebman, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, stated in 1996 that his study found that when habeas corpus petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case, there was \\"a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995\\".[80] Similarly, a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review article puts the success rate in habeas corpus cases involving death row inmates even higher, finding that between \\"1976 and 1991, approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted\\".[81] The different numbers are largely definitional, rather than substantive: Freedam's statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed, while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to habeas corpus review.\\r\\nA similar process is available for prisoners sentenced to death by the judgment of a federal court.[82]\\r\\nThe AEDPA also provides an expeditious habeas procedure in capital cases for states meeting several requirements set forth in it concerning counsel appointment for death row inmates.[83] Under this program, federal habeas corpus for condemned prisoners would be decided in about three years from affirmance of the sentence on state collateral review. In 2006, Congress conferred the determination of whether a state fulfilled the requirements to the U.S. attorney general, with a possible appeal of the state to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. As of March 2016, the Department of Justice has still not granted any certifications.[84]\\r\\nIf the federal court refuses to issue a writ of habeas corpus, the death sentence becomes final for all purposes. In recent times, however, prisoners have postponed execution through another way of federal litigation using the Civil Rights Act of 1871 - codified at 42 U.S.C.??1983 - which allows people to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.\\r\\nWhile the aforementioned appeals are normally limited to one and automatically stay the execution of the death sentence, Section 1983 lawsuits are unlimited, but the petitioner will be granted a stay of execution only if the court believes he has a likelihood of success on the merits.[85]\\r\\nTraditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death.[86] In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\r\\nWhile the execution warrant is issued by the governor in several states, in the vast majority it is a judicial order, issued by a judge or by the state supreme court at the request of the prosecution.\\r\\nThe warrant usually sets an execution day. Some states instead provide a longer period, such as a week or 10 days to carry out the execution. This is designated to avoid issuing a new warrant in case of a last-minute stay of execution that would be vacated only few days or few hours later.[87]\\r\\nWithin the context of the overall murder rate, the death penalty cannot be said to be widely or routinely used in the United States; in recent years the average has been about one death sentence for every 200 murder convictions.\\r\\nAlabama has the highest per capita rate of death sentences. This is because Alabama was one of the few states that allowed judges to override a jury recommendation in favor of life imprisonment, a possibility it removed in March 2017.[88][89]\\r\\nThe distribution of death sentences among states is loosely proportional to their populations and murder rates. California, which is the most populous state, has also the largest death row with over 700 inmates. Wyoming, which is the least populous state, has only one condemned man.\\r\\nBut executions are more frequent (and happen more quickly after sentencing) in conservative states. Texas, which is the second most populous state of the Union, carried out over 500 executions during the post-Furman era, more than a third of the national total. California has carried out only 13 executions during the same period.[90][91][92]\\r\\nAfrican Americans made up 41% of death row inmates while making up only 12.6% of the general population. They have made up 34% of those actually executed since 1976. However, this is an under-representation relative to the proportion of convicted murderers; 52.5% of all homicide offenders between 1980 and 2008 were African Americans.[93] According to a 2003 Amnesty International report, blacks and whites were the victims of murder in almost equal numbers, yet 80% of the people executed since 1977 were convicted of murders involving white victims.[94]\\r\\nApproximately 13.5% of death row inmates are of Hispanic or Latino descent, while they make up 17.4% of the general population.[95]\\r\\nAs of October 1, 2014, men accounted for 98% of people on death row and 99% of executions since 1976.[96]\\r\\nAll 31 states with the death penalty provide lethal injection as the primary method of execution.\\r\\nSome states allow other methods than lethal injection, but only as secondary methods to be used merely at the request of the prisoner or if lethal injection is unavailable.[97][98]\\r\\nSeveral states continue to use the historical three-drug protocol: an anesthetic, pancuronium bromide a paralytic, and potassium chloride to stop the heart.[99] Eight states have used a single-drug protocol, inflicting only an overdose of a single anesthetic to the prisoner.[99]\\r\\nWhile some state statutes specify the drugs required, a majority do not, giving more flexibility to corrections officials.[99]\\r\\nPressures from anti-death penalty activists and shareholders have made it difficult for correctional services to get the chemicals. Hospira, the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped making the drug in 2011.[100] In 2016, it was reported that more than 20 U.S. and European drug manufacturers including Pfizer (the owner of Hospira) had taken steps to prevent their drugs from being used for lethal injections.[100][101][102]\\r\\nSince then, some states have used other anesthetics, such as pentobarbital, etomidate,[103] or fast-acting benzodiazepines like midazolam.[104] Many states have since bought lethal injection drugs from foreign furnishers, and most states have made it a criminal offense to reveal the identities of furnishers or execution team members.[100][105] In November 2015, California adopted regulations allowing the state to use its own public compounding pharmacies to make the chemicals.[106]\\r\\nIn 2009, Ohio approved the use of an intramuscular injection of 500 mg of hydromorphone (a 333-fold overdose for an opioid-na?ve patient of this narcotic analgesic closely related to and five times stronger than morphine; this is the equivalent of an entire 50-ml bottle of Dilaudid HP, the most powerful commercially available form, although the advantage of hydromorphone is its very high solubility allowing for solutions of almost arbitrary concentration; 500 mg of hydromorphone HCl as pure powder can be dissolved in isotonic saline in volumes as small as under 2 cc)[107] and a supratherapeutic dose of midazolam as a backup means of carrying out executions when a suitable vein cannot be found for intravenous injection.[108][109]\\r\\nLethal injection was held to be a constitutional method of execution by the U.S. Supreme Court in two cases: Baze v. Rees (2008) and Glossip v. Gross (2015).[110][111]\\r\\nIn the following states, death row inmates with an execution warrant may choose to be executed by:[97][98]\\r\\nIn five states (Arizona, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Utah), the alternative method is offered only to inmates sentenced to death for crimes committed prior to a specified date (usually when the state switched from the earlier method to lethal injection).\\r\\nWhen an offender chooses to be executed by a means different from the state default method, which is always lethal injection, he loses the right to challenge its constitutionality in court (Stewart v. LaGrand, 1999).\\r\\nThe last executions by methods other than injection are as follows (all chosen by the inmate):\\r\\nDepending on the state, the following alternative methods are statutorily provided in the event that lethal injection is either found unconstitutional by a court or unavailable for practical reasons:[97][98][112]\\r\\nOklahoma is the only state allowing more than two methods of execution in its statutes, providing lethal injection, nitrogen hypoxia, electrocution and firing squad to be used in that order in the event that all earlier methods are unavailable. The nitrogen option was added by the Oklahoma Legislature in 2015 and has never been used in a judicial execution, though it is routinely used to give a painless death in animal euthanasia.[113]\\r\\nThree states (Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah) have added back-up methods recently in 2014 or 2015 (or have expanded their application fields) in reaction to the shortage of lethal injection drugs.[114]\\r\\nSome states such as Florida have a larger provision dealing with execution methods unavailability, requiring their state departments of corrections to use \\"any constitutional method\\" if both lethal injection and electrocution are found unconstitutional. This was designed to make unnecessary any further legislative intervention in that event, but the provision apply only to legal (not practical) infeasibility.[115][116]\\r\\nIn May 2016, an Oklahoma grand jury recommended the state to use nitrogen hypoxia as its primary method of execution rather than as a mere backup, after experts testified that the method would be painless, easy and \\"inexpensive\\".[117]\\r\\nThe method of execution of federal prisoners for offenses under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is that of the state in which the conviction took place. If the state has no death penalty, the judge must choose a state with the death penalty for carrying out the execution.\\r\\nThe federal government has a facility (at U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute) and regulations only for executions by lethal injection, but the United States Code allows U.S. Marshals to use state facilities and employees for federal executions.[118][119]\\r\\nThe last public execution in the U.S. was that of Rainey Bethea in Owensboro, Kentucky, on August 14, 1936.\\r\\nIt was the last execution in the nation at which the general public was permitted to attend without any legally imposed restrictions. \\"Public execution\\" is a legal phrase, defined by the laws of various states, and carried out pursuant to a court order. Similar to \\"public record\\" or \\"public meeting\\", it means that anyone who wants to attend the execution may do so.\\r\\nAround 1890, a political movement developed in the United States to mandate private executions. Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a \\"wall\\" or \\"enclosure\\", or to \\"exclude public view\\". Most states laws currently use such explicit wording to prohibit public executions, while others do so only implicitly by enumerating the only authorized witnesses.[120]\\r\\nAll states allow news reporters to be execution witnesses for information of the general public, except Wyoming which allow only witnesses authorized by the condemned.[121][122][123] Several states also allow victims' families and relatives selected by the prisoner to watch executions. An hour or two before the execution, the condemned is offered religious services and to choose his last meal (except in Texas which abolished it in 2011).\\r\\nThe execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001, was witnessed by over 200 people, most by closed-circuit television.\\r\\nGallup, Inc. monitors support for the death penalty in the United States since 1937 by asking \\"Are you in favor of the death penalty for a person convicted of murder?\\" In their last poll in October 2016, 60% of respondents said they were in favor and 37% were opposed.[124] A month earlier, a Pew Research poll found that 49% of Americans supported the death penalty for convicted murderers and 42% opposed, down from 80% in 1974.[125]\\r\\nA 2010 poll found that 61% of voters would choose a penalty other than the death sentence for murder.[126] When persons surveyed are given a choice between the death penalty and life without parole for persons convicted of capital crimes, support for execution has traditionally been significantly lower than in polling that asks only if a person does or does not support the death penalty. In 2010, for instance, a Gallup poll that offered a choice showed 49% favoring the death penalty, and 46% favoring life imprisonment.[127]\\r\\nOn the other hand, in November 2009, another Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans say that September 11 attacks' mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed should get the death penalty if convicted, including 12 who normally opposed the death penalty when asked the 1937 question.[128] A similar result was found in 2001 when respondents were polled about the execution of Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City Bombing that killed 168 victims.[129]\\r\\nCapital punishment is a controversial issue, with many prominent organizations and individuals participating in the debate. Amnesty International and other groups oppose capital punishment on moral grounds.\\r\\nSome law enforcement organizations, and some victims' rights groups support capital punishment.\\r\\nThe United States is one of four industrialized democracies that still practice capital punishment with Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan.\\r\\nReligious groups are widely split on the issue of capital punishment.[130] The Fiqh Council of North America, a group of highly influential Muslim scholars in the United States, has issued a fatwa calling for a moratorium on capital punishment in the United States until various preconditions in the legal system are met.[131]\\r\\nIn October 2009, the American Law Institute voted to disavow the framework for capital punishment that it had created in 1962, as part of the Model Penal Code, \\"in light of the current intractable institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate system for administering capital punishment\\". A study commissioned by the institute had said that experience had proved that the goal of individualized decisions about who should be executed and the goal of systemic fairness for minorities and others could not be reconciled.[132] As of 2017[update], 159 prisoners have been exonerated due to evidence of their innocence.[126][133][134]\\r\\nAdvocates of the death penalty say that it deters crime, is a good tool for prosecutors in plea bargaining,[135] improves the community by eliminating recidivism by executed criminals, provides \\"closure\\" to surviving victims or loved ones, and is a just penalty.\\r\\nThe murder rate is highest in the South (6.5 per 100,000 in 2016), where 80% of executions are carried out, and lowest in the Northeast (3.5 per 100,000), with less than 1% of executions. A report by the US National Research Council in 2012 stated that studies claiming a deterrent effect are \\"fundamentally flawed\\" and should not be used for policy decisions.[126]\\r\\nAccording to a survey of the former and present presidents of the countrys top academic criminological societies, 88% of these experts rejected the notion that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to murder. (Radelet & Lacock, 2009)[126]\\r\\nData shows that the application of the death penalty is strongly influenced by racial bias.[126] Furthermore, some opponents argue that it is applied in an arbitrary manner by a criminal justice system that has been shown to be biased through the systemic influence of socio-economic, geographic, and gender factors.[136] Another argument in the capital punishment debate is the cost.[137][126]\\r\\nThe largest number of clemencies was granted in January 2003 in Illinois when outgoing Governor George Ryan, who had already imposed a moratorium on executions, pardoned four death-row inmates and commuted the sentences of the remaining 167 to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[138] When Governor Pat Quinn signed legislation abolishing the death penalty in Illinois in March 2011, he commuted the sentences of the fifteen inmates on death row to life imprisonment.[35]\\r\\nPrevious post-Furman mass clemencies took place in 1986 in New Mexico, when Governor Toney Anaya commuted all death sentences because of his personal opposition to the death penalty. In 1991, outgoing Ohio Governor Dick Celeste commuted the sentences of eight prisoners, among them all four women on the state's death row. And during his two terms (1979-1987) as Florida's Governor, Bob Graham, although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-Furman involuntary execution as well as 15 others, agreed to commute the sentences of six people on the grounds of doubts about guilt or disproportionality.\\r\\nAll executions were suspended through the country between September 2007 and April 2008. At that time, the U.S. Supreme Court was examining the constitutionality of lethal injection in Baze v. Rees. This was the longest period with no executions in the United States since 1982. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld this method in a 7-2 ruling.\\r\\nIn addition to the states that have no valid death penalty statute, the following states and jurisdictions are noted that have an official moratorium, or have had no executions for more than ten years, as of 2017:\\r\\nKansas, New Hampshire, Wyoming, and the U.S. Military have also no executions for over ten years, but in these states it is because of the lack of death row inmates having exhausted the appeal process.\\r\\nSince 1976, four states have executed only condemned prisoners who voluntarily waived further appeals: Pennsylvania has executed three inmates, Oregon two, Connecticut one, and New Mexico one.\\r\\nIn North Carolina, executions are suspended following a decision by the state's medical board that physicians cannot participate in executions, which is a requirement under state law.\\r\\nIn California, United States District Judge Jeremy Fogel suspended all executions in the state on December 15, 2006, ruling that the implementation used in California was unconstitutional but that it could be fixed.[143]\\r\\nOn November 25, 2009, the Kentucky Supreme Court suspended executions until the state adopts regulations for carrying out the penalty by lethal injection.[144]\\r\\nIn November 2011, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber announced a moratorium on executions in Oregon, canceling a planned execution and ordering a review of the death penalty system in the state.[145]\\r\\nOn February 11, 2014, Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced a capital punishment moratorium. All death penalty cases that come to Inslee will result in him issuing a reprieve, not a pardon or commutation.[146]\\r\\nOn February 13, 2015, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf announced a moratorium on the death penalty. Wolf will issue a reprieve for every execution until a commission on capital punishment, which was established in 2011 by the Pennsylvania State Senate, produces a recommendation.[147] Effectively there was a moratorium in place, as the state had not executed anyone since Gary M. Heidnik in 1999.","input":"How many states in america carry the death penalty?"},{"output":"effects of the Nigerian Civil War (1967ÿ1970) on the people, and the \\"civil peace\\" that followed","context":"\\"Civil Peace\\" is a 1971 short story by Chinua Achebe. It is about the effects of the Nigerian Civil War (1967ÿ1970) on the people, and the \\"civil peace\\" that followed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story starts off in eastern Nigeria after the civil war has ended. The protagonist, Jonathan Iwegbu, was able to keep his bicycle, which he turns into a taxi to make money. In two weeks he makes 150 pounds. Jonathan then travels to Enugu to search for his home, and to his surprise it is still standing when other structures around it are demolished. The house needs some repairs, so Jonathan finds some supplies around and hires a carpenter. He then moves his family back in. The entire family works hard to earn money and rebuild their lives. The children pick mangoes and Maria makes akara balls to sell. After finding that his job as a miner isn't a possibility he decides to run a bar for soldiers out of his house.\\r\\nJonathan gets an \\"egg rasher\\" (a butchered pronunciation of the Latin ex gratia, which translates into \\"as a favor\\") for turning in rebel currency to the Treasury, and in exchange they gave him 20 pounds legitimate currency. The next night, a large group of robbers show up at his house demanding 100 pounds. When Jonathan replies that he only has 20 pounds, the leader of the robbers demands he hand the money through the open window. After they take the money, life goes on as usual for Jonathan because \\"Nothing Puzzles God,\\" meaning that the robbery has a greater meaning in God's eyes than how it seemed to Jonathan.\\r\\nJonathan Iwegbu, the protagonist of \\"Civil Peace\\", is the optimistic nucleus of the entire narrative. Despite the recent devastation of the Biafran War, Jonathan exhibits a happy tone in the face of death. Jonathan's optimism is first demonstrated in the first paragraph when he exclaims how happy he is for his life. The quote repeated towards the end of the book reflects the theme is \\"Nothing puzzles God\\" [1] and then continues to explain \\"He had come out of the war with five inestimable blessings --- his head, his wife Marias head, and the heads of three out of their four children.\\"[2] The protagonist is happy because he can now enjoy the company of those alive, instead of being sad for the one who died. Jonathan's optimism continues to prevail when he sees his house for the first time which, was slightly damaged \\"But what was that?\\"[3] and then continues to explain that he had enough time left in the day to forage for materials \\"... before thousands more came out of their forest holes looking for the same things,\\"[4] further emphasizing his optimism and its benefits. Later in the story, Jonathan opens a bar, creating new employment as opposed to dwelling in the fact that his former job, mining coal, is no longer an option. Jonathan's optimism remains unshakable through to the end of the story even when all of his money is stolen by thieves.\\r\\nMuch of Chinua Achebe's literature was inspired by the events of the Biafran War and by the responses to a war that, for many Igbo writers, was a struggle for survival, a search for a new beginning for Africa, and a redefinition of Black identity in the context of a complex world behavior.[5] A leading novelist at the time, Chinua Achebe was a pioneer in post-war Igbo literary activities. Achebe maintained[6]\\r\\nIt is clear to me that an African creative writer who tries to avoid the big social and political issues of contemporary Africa will end up being completely irrelevant --- like the absurd man in the proverb who leaves his burning house to pursue a rat fleeing from the flames.\\r\\nAchebe does not hide the fact that the Biafran situation has affected his creativity in no small way.","input":"What is civil peace by chinua achebe about?"},{"output":"five years","context":"Baby Driver is a 2017 action crime film written and directed by Edgar Wright. It stars Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Lily James, Eiza Gonzlez, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Bernthal. The plot follows Baby, a young getaway driver and music lover who must work for a kingpin in helping perform several heists alongside seasoned robbers, putting himself and his waitress girlfriend under increasing danger. Taking its title from the Simon & Garfunkel song of the same name, the film features choreography in which the actors' movements and actions synchronize with its soundtrack.\\r\\nBaby Driver was conceived by Wright after he found inspiration from envisioning a post-heist car chase set to the 1994 song \\"Bellbottoms\\" by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, which would ultimately be used as the film's opening scene. It was co-produced by Working Title Films, Big Talk Productions and Media Rights Capital, and was distributed worldwide by Sony Pictures and by TriStar Pictures in the US. It premiered at South by Southwest on March 11, 2017, and was released theatrically on June 28, 2017.[6][7]\\r\\nThe film received critical acclaim, with its action sequences, performances (particularly that of Elgort, Foxx, and Hamm), and Wright's screenplay and direction earning notable praise, and was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2017.[8] The film grossed $226 million worldwide against a production budget of $34 million, making it Wright's highest-grossing film as director. The film received a nomination for Best Actor ÿ Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Elgort at the 75th Golden Globe Awards.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaby is a?getaway driver?in?Atlanta, Georgia. When he was a child, a car accident killed his parents and left him with?tinnitus, which he blocks out by listening to music on?iPods. He ferries crews of robbers assembled by Doc, a heist mastermind, to pay off a debt he incurred after stealing one of Doc's cars. Between jobs, he creates remixes from snippets of conversations he records, and cares for his deaf foster father Joseph. At a diner, he meets a waitress, Debora, and they start dating.\\r\\nBaby's next robbery goes awry after an armed bystander chases them down, but Baby evades him and the police. Having paid his debt, Baby quits his life of crime and starts delivering pizzas. While Baby is on a date with Debora, Doc insists he join a heist at a post office, threatening to hurt Debora if he refuses.\\r\\nThe crew consists of easy-going Buddy, his sharpshooter wife Darling, and trigger-happy Bats, who takes an immediate dislike to Baby. While the crew attempts to purchase illegal arms for the job, Bats realizes the dealers are police and opens fire, killing them all. Afterwards, Bats forces Baby to stop at Debora's diner, unaware of Baby and Debora's romance, and nearly kills her in a hold-up.\\r\\nDoc, furious at the botched deal, tries to cancel the heist, but Baby convinces him to go through with it. He attempts to flee later that night, hoping to take Debora and leave Atlanta. He is stopped by Buddy and Bats, who have discovered his recordings and believe he is an informant; when they and Doc hear his mixtapes, they are convinced of his innocence.\\r\\nDuring the heist, Bats kills a security guard. Disgusted, Baby refuses to drive the crew, causing Bats to hit him. Baby rams the car into?rebar?which impales Bats, killing him. The three flee the police on foot. After police kill Darling, Buddy blames Baby for her death, and vows to kill him. Baby steals another car and flees to his apartment. After leaving Joseph at an assisted living home, Baby drives to Debora's diner to pick her up, where he discovers Buddy waiting. Baby shoots Buddy and flees with Debora as the police close in.\\r\\nBaby seeks help from Doc, who initially refuses to help as he blames Baby for ruining the heist. After seeing he truly loves Debora, Doc supplies them with cash and directions to get out of the country, stating that he was also in love once. Buddy ambushes them in the parking garage and hits and kills Doc with a stolen police car. A cat-and-mouse game ensues until Buddy has Baby at his mercy and shoots next to both his ears, deafening Baby. Debora disarms Buddy with a crowbar and Baby shoots him with the pistol, causing him to fall to his death.\\r\\nFleeing Atlanta, Baby and Debora run into a police roadblock. Debora prepares to ram it, but Baby stops her and surrenders, telling her she does not belong in the world of crime. At Baby's trial, Joseph, Debora, and several people Baby saved during the robberies testify in his defense. Baby is sentenced to 25 years in prison with a parole hearing after five years. He receives postcards from Debora, who promises to wait for him. Baby is released and finds Debora waiting, and they kiss.\\r\\nFilmmaker Walter Hill makes a vocal cameo appearance as a courtroom interpreter during Baby's trial hearing near the end of the film. Wright has cited Hill's 1978 film The Driver as a major inspiration for Baby Driver.\\r\\nWriter-director Edgar Wright conceived Baby Driver during the mid-1990s after listening to the song \\"Bellbottoms\\" by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. Wright envisioned a bank robbery and car chase set to the song, which became the first scene of the film.[15] He adapted the first opening he conceived for the film into a 2003 music video he directed for Mint Royale's \\"Blue Song\\",[16] starring Noel Fielding as a music-loving getaway driver for a group of bank robbers.[17] A clip of the music video is shown briefly in Baby Driver as the main character flips between television channels.[18] Other inspirations for the film came from the films Straight Time, Point Break, Reservoir Dogs and Heat.[17]\\r\\nThe film was announced in July 2014.[19] By January 2015 it was reported that Ansel Elgort was in talks to star.[20] Elgort's audition required him to lip sync and dance to the song of his choosing. Elgort chose Easy by The Commodores which resonated with Wright to the point where he would include the song in the movie.[21]\\r\\nEmma Stone and Michael Douglas were also rumoured to be in the cast.[22] On May 7, 2015, Lily James was reported to be in talks to be the female lead, a waitress and Elgort's character's love interest.[23][24]\\r\\nJamie Foxx was reported to be in talks to join the film on September 8, 2015.[25] On October 20, 2015, Jon Hamm signed on to play one of the villains, a former Wall Street trader turned member of the gang.[24] On November 3, 2015, it was announced that Kevin Spacey had been cast as a veteran criminal and the boss of the crew.[26] On December 16, 2015, Eiza Gonzlez joined the film to play one of the bank robbersthe wife of Hamm's character.[27] Jon Bernthal was cast as Griff, another one of the gang, on February 23, 2016.[28]\\r\\nWright enlisted choreographer Ryan Heffington to sync the actors' timing and movements with the soundtrack.[29][30]\\r\\nPrincipal photography, which took place in Atlanta, Georgia, began on February 17, 2016, and concluded on May 13.[31][32]\\r\\nIn August 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that the film would be released on March 17, 2017. It was briefly pushed back to August 11, 2017 before a final date of June 28, 2017 was settled on.[33] Baby Driver had its world premiere at the South by Southwest film festival on March 11, 2017.[34] On the weekend of August 25, the film was re-released in 1,074 theaters.[35]\\r\\nBaby Driver was released on Digital Media on September 12, 2017, and on 4K Ultra HD/Blu-ray Combo Pack, Blu-ray & DVD October 10, 2017, from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.[36] The film debuted at No. 2 on both the NPD VideoScan First Alert sales chart and the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart, behind Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.[37]\\r\\nBaby Driver grossed $107.8 million in the United States and Canada and $119.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $226.9 million, against a production budget of $34 million.[5]\\r\\nIn North America, Baby Driver was initially projected to gross $12ÿ20 million from 3,150 theaters over its first five days, with the possibility to earn more due to strong reviews.[4] The film made $5.7 million on its first day (including $2.1 million from Tuesday-night previews) and $3.3 million on Thursday.[38] It made $6 million on Friday, increasing five-day projections to $27 million. It ended up opening to $21 million (and a five-day total of $30 million), finishing second behind another new release, Despicable Me 3 ($72.4 million). This marked the biggest American debut of Wright's career, doubling the $10.6 million opening of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World in 2010.[39] In its second weekend, Baby Driver grossed $13 million (a drop of 36.7%), finishing third at the box office;[40] in its third weekend, the film made $8.8 million, finishing fourth.[41] The film was re-released into 1,074 theaters on August 25 and made $1.2 million, up 34% from the previous week.[42]\\r\\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 300 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Stylish, exciting, and fueled by a killer soundtrack, Baby Driver hits the road and it's goneproving fast-paced action movies can be smartly written without sacrificing thrills.\\"[43] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".[44] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale.[38]\\r\\nPeter Debruge of Variety called the film \\"a blast, featuring wall-to-wall music and a surfeit of inspired ideas\\".[45] The New York Times' Manohla Dargis listed the film as a \\"NYT Critics Pick\\", writing that the film \\"is so good that you want it to be better and go deeper, for it to put down its guns (or at least hold them differently) and transcend its clichs and cine-quotes so it can rocket out of the genre safe box into the cosmic beyond where craft and technique transform into art\\".[46] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film five out of five stars, listing it as his \\"film of the week\\" and calling it an \\"outrageously enjoyable petrolhead heist caper\\".[47]\\r\\nCNN's Brian Lowry wrote that the film \\"is a crackling-good ride, one that organically weaves music and humor into a slick showcase for its cast. Despite a few plotholes toward the end, writer-director Edgar Wright's stylish thriller consistently clicks on all cylinders\\".[48] Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, and called it \\"fluid and jaw-droppingthe kind of thing you want to see immediately again after it's over to catch all the things you missed\\".[49] Empire's Terri White gave the film five out of five stars, calling it an \\"awe-inspiring piece of filmmaking\\" and \\"one of the most utterly original films in years\\".[50]\\r\\nHowever, there were several less positive reviews. Rating Baby Driver three out of five stars, Joyce Slaton of Common Sense Media praised the driving sequences and music, but felt that the film \\"quickly slump[s] into stereotypes\\" and \\"fails to grab viewers on a visceral level\\", particularly criticizing Baby's backstory and the portrayal of Debora and Darling.[51] In a dismissive review, Richard Brody of The New Yorker cited many flaws, calling it \\"an imitation of generations worth of imitations.\\"[52]\\r\\nOn December 5, 2017, Wright confirmed that Sony Pictures wants a sequel to Baby Driver made and he plans to write the screenplay for it.[68]","input":"Baby driver how long was he in jail?"},{"output":"phagocytosis","context":"Phototrophs (in general)\\r\\n???Euglenales/Euglenina\\r\\n???Eutreptiales/Eutreptiina\\r\\n???Euglenamorphales/Euglenamorphina\\r\\nOsmotrophs\\r\\n???Rhabdomonadales/Rhabdomonadina\\r\\nPhagotrophs\\r\\n????Heteronematales/Heteronematina\\r\\n????Sphenomonadales/Sphenomonadina\\r\\nEuglenids (euglenoids, or euglenophytes, formally Euglenida/Euglenoida, ICZN, or Euglenophyceae, ICBN) are one of the best-known groups of flagellates, which are excavate eukaryotes of the phylum Euglenophyta and their cell structure is typical of that group. They are commonly found in freshwater, especially when it is rich in organic materials, with a few marine and endosymbiotic members. Most euglenids are unicellular. Many euglenids have chloroplasts and produce their own food through photosynthesis, but others feed by phagocytosis, or strictly by diffusion. This group is known to contain the carbohydrate paramylon.\\r\\nEuglenids are said to descend from an ancestor that took up green algae by secondary endosymbiosis.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEuglenids are distinguished mainly by the presence of a pellicle (periplast). Within its taxon, the pellicle is one of the euglenids' most diverse features from a morphological standpoint.[4] The pellicle is composed of proteinaceous strips underneath the cell membrane, supported by dorsal and ventral microtubules. This varies from rigid to flexible, and gives the cell its shape, often giving it distinctive striations. In many euglenids the strips can slide past one another, causing an inching motion called metaboly. Otherwise they move using their flagella.\\r\\nThe euglenids were first defined by Otto Btschli in 1884 as the flagellate order Euglenida, as an animal. Botanists subsequently created the algal division Euglenophyta; thus they were classified as both animals and plants, as they share characteristics with both. Conflicts of this nature are exemplary of why the kingdom Protista was adopted. However, they retained their double-placement until the flagellates were split up, and both names are still used to refer to the group. Their chlorophyll are not masked with accessory pigments.\\r\\nThe classification of euglenids is still variable, as groups are being revised to conform with their molecular phylogeny. Classifications have fallen in line with the traditional groups based on differences in nutrition and number of flagella; these provide a starting point for considering euglenid diversity. Different characteristics of the euglenids' pellicles can provide insight into their modes of movement and nutrition.[5]\\r\\nAs with other Euglenozoa, the primitive mode of nutrition is phagocytosis. Prey such as bacteria and smaller flagellates are ingested through a cytostome, supported by microtubules. These are often packed together to form two or more rods, which function in ingestion, and in Entosiphon form an extendable siphon. Most phagotrophic euglenids have two flagella, one leading and one trailing. The latter is used for gliding along the substrate. In some, such as Peranema, the leading flagellum is rigid and beats only at its tip.\\r\\nOsmotrophic euglenids are euglenids which have undergone osmotrophy.\\r\\nDue to a lack of characteristics which are useful for taxonomical purposes, the origin of osmotrophic euglenids is unclear. Though, certain morphological characteristics reveal a small fraction of osmotrophic euglenids are derived from phototrophic and phagotrophic ancestors.[6]\\r\\nA prolonged absence of light or exposure to harmful chemicals may cause atrophy and absorption of the chloroplasts without otherwise harming the organism. There are a number of species where a chloroplast's absence was formerly marked with separate genera such as Astasia (colourless Euglena) and Hyalophacus (colourless Phacus). Due to the lack of a developed cytostome, these forms feed exclusively by osmotrophic absorption.\\r\\nAlthough euglenids share several common characteristics with animals, which is why they were originally classified as so, there is no evidence of euglenids ever using sexual reproduction. This is one of the reasons they could no longer be classified as animals.\\r\\nFor euglenids to reproduce, asexual reproduction takes place in the form of binary fission, and the cells replicate and divide during mitosis and cytokinesis. This process occurs in a very distinct order. First, the basal bodies and flagella replicate, then the cytostome and microtubules (the feeding apparatus), and finally the nucleus and remaining cytoskeleton. Once this occurs, the organism begins to cleave at the basal bodies, and this cleavage line moves towards the center of the organism until two separate euglenids are evident.[7] Because of the way that this reproduction takes place and the axis of separation, this is called longitudinal cell division or longitudinal binary fission.[8]\\r\\nEuglena sp.

It has Japan's second-largest station building (after Nagoya Station) and is one of the country's largest buildings, incorporating a shopping mall, hotel, movie theater, Isetan department store, and several local government facilities under one 15-story roof. It also housed the Kyoto City Air Terminal until August 31, 2002.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKyoto Station is served by the following railway lines:\\r\\nIn addition to the lines above, the following lines, among others, have through services to Kyoto Station:\\r\\nThe station has a side platform and four island platforms serving eight tracks for the Tokaido Line (Biwako Line, JR Kyoto Line) and Kosei Line at ground level, three dead-end platforms serving four tracks for the Sanin Line (Sagano Line) to the west of platform 0 at ground level, and two dead-end platforms serving 3 tracks to the south of platform 7 at ground level. Two island platforms serving four tracks for the Shinkansen are elevated, above the platforms for the Kintetsu Kyoto Line.\\r\\nThe station has three levels. Four dead-end platforms serving four tracks are located on the second floor. The 1st floor is a shopping street and the 3rd is the platforms for the Shinkansen (JR Central).\\r\\nThe station consists of one underground island platform serving two tracks.\\r\\nThe governmental railway from Kobe reached Kyoto on September 5, 1876, but the station was under construction and a temporary facility called miya-dri (miya Street) Temporary Station was used until the opening of the main station. The first Kyoto Station opened for service by decree of Emperor Meiji on February 5, 1877.[6]\\r\\nIn 1889, the railway became a part of the trunk line to Tokyo (Tokaido Main Line). Subsequently, the station became the terminal of two private railways, Nara Railway (1895, present-day Nara Line) and Kyoto Railway (1897, present-day Sagano Line), that connected the station with southern and northern regions of Kyoto Prefecture, respectively.[7]\\r\\nThe station was replaced by a newer, Renaissance-inspired facility in 1914, which featured a broad square (the site of demolished first station) leading from the station to Shichij Avenue. Before and during World War II, the square was often used by imperial motorcades when Emperor Showa traveled between Kyoto and Tokyo. The station was spacious and designed to handle a large number of people, but when a few thousand people gathered to bid farewell to naval recruits on January 8, 1934, 77 people were crushed to death. This station burned to the ground in 1950, and was replaced by a more utilitarian concrete facility in 1952.\\r\\nThe current Kyoto Station opened in 1997, commemorating Kyoto's 1,200th anniversary. It is 70 meters high and 470 meters from east to west, with a total floor area of 238,000 square meters. Architecturally, it exhibits many characteristics of futurism, with a slightly irregular cubic fa?ade of plate glass over a steel frame. The architect was Hiroshi Hara.\\r\\nKyoto, one of the least modern cities in Japan by virtue of its many cultural heritage sites, was largely reluctant to accept such an ambitious structure in the mid-1990s: The station's completion began a wave of new high-rise developments in the city that culminated in the 20-story Kyocera Building.\\r\\nAside from the main building on the north side of the station, the Hachij-guchi building on the south side was built to house Tokaido Shinkansen which started operation in 1964. The underground facilities of the station, including the shopping mall Porta beneath the station square, were constructed when the subway opened in 1981.\\r\\nIn fiscal 2016, the JR West part of the station was used by an average of 200,426 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the second busiest JR West station after Osaka.[8] The Kyoto Municipal Subway station was used by an average of 123,360 passengers daily (in fiscal 2016).[9]\\r\\nThis bus stop is in front of Nippon Rent-A- Car Kyoto Station East Exit Office.\\r\\n(>>for Ayabe, Fukuchiyama)\\r\\nCoordinates: 345907N 1354530E? / ?34.985407N 135.758450E? / 34.985407; 135.758450","input":"What is the main train station in kyoto?"},{"output":"usually 6ÿ7 years old","context":"First grade (called Year 2 in the UK) is the first grade in elementary school.

However, the first compulsory school year is Year One, when children are five years old. As most primary schools have a reception class which is treated like a compulsory school year, i.e. the children wear uniform and have the same school hours, most children start school in reception. The first grade is the equivalent of Year Two.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nScottish pupils usually enter the corresponding stage one year younger. In Northern Ireland they are two years younger. In Scotland, first grade is equivalent to Primary 3. Pupils in Primary 3 are 7 to 8 years old. America call their primary education grade school where in Scotland they call it primary school as it would be primary 1 would start after Kindergarten (nursery) and you would be age 4 to 5 years of age. then it would be primary 2 the next year and so on up until primary 7 which would be your last year at primary school then you go off to high school.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn math, students may learn about addition and subtraction of natural numbers, usually with only one digit,  and about measurement. Basic geometry and graphing may be introduced. Clock and calendar time as well as money may also be in the curriculum.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn language, first graders are taught the fundamentals of literacy, including reading sentences, writing very simple statements and mastery of the alphabet, building on what the students have learned in kindergarten or other forms of pre-school (although because first grade is the first compulsory level of education in many U.S. states, the level of literacy in incoming students can vary widely). The expectations for first grade have changed due to the Common Core Standards. Curriculum is typically based on state standards developed by educators in each state. Most states use the Common Core Standards, so most schools across the country are using similar curricula. First graders are now expected to read and comprehend stories ranging in lengths and difficulty. They are also expected to show an improving fluency rate during the school year with ability to easily read  stories by the end of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents are also typically introduced to the concept of social studies with an emphasis on establishing ideas of history or civics in either a personal or larger sense. Some states focus on the basics of US history and patriotism is taught, with a focus on the founding fathers and the time period surrounding the American Revolution; other states require a social studies focus on family relationships in first grade, leaving community, state, and nation studies to higher grades.  Basic geography is also taught in the first grade. Focus on the school's municipal area and culture, along with basic state geography, may also be focused upon in first grade in some states. First grade science usually involves the discussion of matter, plant and animal science, earth materials, and balance and motion, along with the human body, and basic health and nutrition.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience as inquiry is taught and practiced in first grade. Students are encouraged to observe the world around them and begin asking questions about things they notice. As they become more comfortable investigating the world around them, students will also begin asking better questions and making better, more advanced predictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia this year level is called \\"Prep\\" or Foundation.

Since its inception, Red Hot Chili Peppers has maintained a four-member lineup, with fourteen official members overall.\\r\\nIn late 1983, two weeks before signing with EMI, Slovak and Irons obtained a record deal with MCA Records with their other band, What Is This?, and left Red Hot Chili Peppers.[2] Rather than dissolving the band, Kiedis and Flea decided to recruit new members. Cliff Martinez was hired as the band's new drummer and Martinez's bandmate in The Weirdos, guitarist, Dix Denney was expected to replace Slovak. After a few rehearsals, however, the band felt he didn't fit and auditions continued. Their final candidates were guitarists Mark Nine and Jack Sherman, about whom the band knew nothing. After practicing with Sherman, they felt that he was the best fit because he worked well with Flea and Martinez.[3] With Martinez and Sherman aboard, the band released their eponymous debut album on August 10, 1984. During the ensuing tour, continuing musical and lifestyle tension between Kiedis and Sherman complicated the transition between concert and daily band life.[4][5] Sherman was fired soon after, with Slovak returning to the Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of What Is This?.[6] At one point, Chuck Biscuits filled in on drums during the 1985 tour. The band dismissed Cliff Martinez from the group in April 1986 due to personal differences and replaced him with founding member Jack Irons, who was out of work and finally separated from other commitments.[7] During this period, however, Kiedis and Slovak had both developed serious drug addictions, which resulted in Kiedis being briefly fired that same year. At one performance, longtime friend and then Circle Jerks frontman, Keith Morris filled in for an absent Kiedis who was out scoring drugs while his band was playing a show.[8][9] On June 25, 1988, Slovak died of a heroin overdose shortly after the completion of The Uplift Mofo Party Plan tour. Kiedis would then retreat into hiding, further fueling his drug habit and even skipping Slovak's funeral. After a band meeting with manager Lindy Goetz, Irons subsequently left the group, saying that he did not want to be part of a band where his friends were dying.[1]\\r\\nAttempting to cope with the death of Slovak and the departure of Irons, Kiedis and Flea temporarily employed Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro and former P-Funk guitarist DeWayne McKnight.[10] McKnight's tenure was brief, lasting three shows in September 1988 before he was fired. He was quickly replaced by John Frusciante in October 1988 and writing for the next album quickly began. Peligro however was dealing with personal substance problems of his own and would last a few more months before he too was fired. Despite several open auditions, the band remained without a drummer. One of the final drummers to audition was Chad Smith, who Kiedis said was so proficient on the drums he \\"ate [them] for breakfast\\".[11] After another successful jam session, Kiedis, Frusciante and Flea admitted Smith into the Chili Peppers and was hired in November 1988.[12]\\r\\nDuring the 1992 Japanese leg of the Blood Sugar Sex Magik tour, Frusciante, overwhelmed by the band's new-found success and his drug addiction, abruptly quit in May.[1] Circle Jerks bassist Zander Schloss was auditioned but after four days of rehearsing, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith decided that Schloss did not fit with their future plans.[13] The band originally had wanted Dave Navarro as their guitarist but Navarro's band, Jane's Addiction had just broken up and he wasn't ready to join another band. With a major summer tour planned including a headlining spot at Lollapalooza, guitarist Arik Marshall of L.A. band Marshall Law was hired as Frusciante's official replacement and would finish out the remainder of tour with the band. Coming off their most successful tour the band was excited to start recording their next album however during pre-production of their sixth studio album, tensions grew between the band and Marshall, and they dismissed him from the band in early 1993.[14] Shortly following Marshall's firing, the band held open auditions that proved to be a failure.[15] Kiedis attended a show by local L.A. band, Mother Tongue and quickly was drawn to the band's guitarist, Jesse Tobias. Tobias was recruited after a series of auditions; however, his tenure with the band was brief and after weeks of writing and rehearsals for the next album the band stated that \\"the chemistry wasn't right\\" and he was fired although the band already had his replacement ready. Chad was friends with and in contact with Navarro, who he said was now ready to join the band so on September 5, 1993 Navarro was officially hired as the band's seventh guitarist and work quickly began on the band's next record, One Hot Minute, which would be released in 1995 and was seen as a disappointment in sales compared to their previous album.[16][16][17]\\r\\nThe band's One Hot Minute tour proved to be successful however for the band it could easily be viewed as a disaster. Navarro never felt he fit properly in the band and the chemistry just wasn't there with him. Following attempts to write and rehearse for their seventh studio album, in April 1998, it was announced that Navarro had been fired from the band due to creative differences; Kiedis stated that the decision was \\"mutual\\".[18] With the band on the brink of a break-up, Kiedis informed Flea that he felt the only way the band could continue is if Frusicante would return. Flea surprised Kiedis by stating he had been in contact with Frusciante and had a feeling he might be open to rejoining. That same month after Navarro's departure, Flea visited Frusciante and invited him to rejoin the band. An emotional and now sober Frusciante readily accepted the invitation. With Frusciante back, the band went on to release three of their most successful albums; 1999's Californication, 2002's By the Way and 2006's Stadium Arcadium.[19]\\r\\nIn late 2007 following the band's Stadium Arcadium tour, the Red Hot Chili Peppers went on a hiatus, with Kiedis citing exhaustion as the main reason.[20] The band's hiatus lasted until October 2009 when they started to write and rehearse for their tenth album however absent from these rehearsals was Fruciante although present was the band's touring guitarist, Josh Klinghoffer leading many to speculate Frusciante had again left the band. Speculation proved to be true with Frusciante already having quit the band for a second time on July 29, 2009 however it wasn't until December 2009 in a post on his official website that he made his departure from the band official to the public.[21] He stated that he left Red Hot Chili Peppers during the hiatus to focus on a solo career.[22][23] Klinghoffer, who acted as a sideman during 2007 dates on the band's Stadium Arcadium tour and on John Frusciante's solo projects, joined the band on October 12, 2009;[24] however, his membership was not announced until February 8, 2010.[25][26] With Klinghoffer, the band saw this as a new beginning and in August 2011 they released their tenth-studio album, I'm with You. During this tour, the band added backing musicians, Mauro Refosco and Chris Warren (also Smith's drum technician) to their touring lineup.\\r\\nOn April 14, 2012, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted by Chris Rock into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer (who became the youngest inductee ever), Frusciante, Slovak, Irons and Martinez were the members inducted. Slovak was inducted on behalf of his brother, James while Frusciante, who was invited, declined the band's offer and didn't show up although was heavily praised during the induction speech by his former bandmates. Despite their contributions to the band's studio albums, Jack Sherman and Dave Navarro were neither inducted nor invited to the ceremony because the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame committee decided that only original members, current members or those who played on more than one album were able to be inducted. Both Martinez and Irons joined the band (marking the first time either drummer had performed with the Chili Peppers since their departures from the band in the 1980s) onstage for a performance of \\"Give It Away\\" and \\"Higher Ground\\", which ended up in an all-star jam involving some of the night's inductees and other guest musicians. The band released their eleventh studio album, The Getaway in June 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2011[update], the lineup of Red Hot Chili Peppers includes one vocalist, one bassist, one drummer, and one guitarist.\\r\\nThe former members of Red Hot Chili Peppers consist of seven guitarists and three drummers.\\r\\nRed Hot Chili Peppers has employed numerous touring and studio musicians throughout its career. A touring or studio musician is an unofficial member who will perform live or contribute in the studio with the band although is not considered an official member. Vicki Calhoun, Keith \\"Tree\\" Barry, and Philip Fisher did contribute to Mother's Milk (1989), where Calhoun performed backing vocals on \\"Knock Me Down\\", \\"Higher Ground\\", \\"Good Time Boys\\", and \\"Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky\\", Barry played tenor sax on \\"Subway to Venus\\", and Fisher provided drums on \\"Taste the Pain\\". Josh Klinghoffer was featured as a backing musician on the final half of the band's Stadium Arcadium tour and eventually become an official member replacing guitarist John Frusciante in 2009. The band's longtime roadie/drum technician, Chris Warren, also became a member of touring lineup in 2007 providing keyboards and drum synthesizers. The band's I'm with You Tour and its following 2013/2014 tour featured percussionist, Mauro Refosco. Refosco also provided percussion for most of the tracks on the band's I'm with You album and related releases. For the band's 2016 The Getaway World Tour, Nate Walcott joined the touring lineup providing piano and keyboards while the band's assistant tour manager Samuel Ba?uelos III provides additional bass when the band performs \\"Go Robot\\".\\r\\nThe band has also seen musicians such as Keith Morris and Chuck Biscuits briefly fill in for a show or two. Morris, who was fronting the Circle Jerks at the time, filled in for Kiedis for a show in 1986. Kiedis was off scoring drugs and missed the band's performance so they asked Morris to fill in however Morris didn't know any of the lyrics to the songs so he screamed and yelled his way through the show. Drummer Chuck Biscuits also briefly filled in on drums back in 1986.","input":"Who were the original members of the red hot chili peppers?"},{"output":"September 13, 2004","context":"The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB)officially, the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Actis a subsection of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a United States federal law that included a prohibition on the manufacture for civilian use of certain semi-automatic firearms it defined as assault weapons, as well as certain ammunition magazines it defined as \\"large capacity\\".\\r\\nThe ten-year ban was passed by the U.S. Congress on September 13, 1994, following a close 52ÿ48 vote in the Senate, and signed into law by then President Bill Clinton the same day. The ban only applied to weapons manufactured after the date of the ban's enactment, and it expired on September 13, 2004, in accordance with its sunset provision.\\r\\nSeveral constitutional challenges were filed against provisions of the ban, but all were rejected by reviewing courts. There were multiple attempts to renew the ban, but none succeeded.\\r\\nStudies have shown the ban had little effect in criminal activity, although this may have been due to the ban's various loopholes.[1][2] Other studies have shown small decreases in the rate of mass shootings followed by increases that began when the ban was lifted.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEfforts to create restrictions on assault weapons at the federal government level intensified in 1989 after 34 children and a teacher were shot and five children killed in Stockton, Calif. with a semi-automatic AK-47 rifle.[4][5][6] The Luby's shooting in October 1991, which left 23 people dead and 27 wounded, was another factor.[7] The July 1993 101 California Street shooting also contributed to passage of the ban. The shooter killed eight people and wounded six. Two of the three firearms he used were TEC-9 semi-automatic handguns with Hellfire triggers.[8] The ban tried to address public concerns about mass shootings by restricting firearms that met the criteria for what it defined as a \\"semiautomatic assault weapon\\", as well as magazines that met the criteria for what it defined as a \\"large capacity ammunition feeding device\\".[9]:1ÿ2\\r\\nIn November 1993, the proposed legislation passed the U.S. Senate. The bill's author, Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and other advocates said that it was a weakened version of the original proposal.[10] In May 1994, former presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan, wrote to the U.S. House of Representatives in support of banning \\"semi-automatic assault guns\\". They cited a 1993 CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll that found 77 percent of Americans supported a ban on the manufacture, sale, and possession of such weapons.[11]\\r\\nRep. Jack Brooks (D-TX), then chair of the House Judiciary Committee, tried unsuccessfully to remove the assault weapons ban section from the crime bill.[12] The National Rifle Association (NRA) opposed the ban. In November 1993, NRA spokesman Bill McIntyre said that assault weapons \\"are used in only 1 percent of all crimes\\".[13] The low usage statistic was supported in a 1999 Department of Justice brief.[9] The legislation passed in September 1994 with the assault weapon ban section expiring in 2004 due to its sunset provision.\\r\\nThe Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Act (the Federal Assault Weapons Ban) was enacted as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.[14] The prohibitions expired on September 13, 2004.[14]\\r\\nThe Act prohibited the manufacture, transfer, or possession of \\"semiautomatic assault weapons\\" as defined by the Act. \\"Weapons banned were identified either by specific make or model (including copies or duplicates thereof, in any caliber), or by specific characteristics that slightly varied according to whether the weapon was a pistol, rifle, or shotgun\\" (see below).[14] The Act also prohibited the transfer and possession of \\"large capacity ammunition feeding devices\\" (LCAFDs). An LCAFD was defined as \\"any magazine, belt, drum, feed strip, or similar device manufactured after the date [of the act] that has the capacity of, or that can be readily restored or converted to accept, more than 10 rounds of ammunition\\".[14]\\r\\nThe Act included a number of exemptions and exclusions from its prohibitions:\\r\\nIn 1989, prior to the enactment of the 1994 legislation, the George H. W. Bush administration had banned the importation of foreign-made, semiautomatic rifles deemed not to have \\"a legitimate sporting use\\". It did not affect similar but domestically manufactured rifles.[15] (The Gun Control Act of 1968 gives discretion to the Attorney General of the United States to choose whether to \\"authorize a firearm or ammunition to be imported or brought into the United States\\" under what is known as \\"the sporting purposes test\\".[14]) Following the enactment of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, the ATF determined that \\"certain semiautomatic assault rifles could no longer be imported even though they were permitted to be imported under the 1989 'sporting purposes test' because they had been modified to remove all of their military features other than the ability to accept a detachable magazine\\", and so in April 1998 \\"prohibited the importation of 56 such rifles, determining that they did not meet the 'sporting purposes test'\\".[14]\\r\\nUnder the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 the definition of \\"semiautomatic assault weapon\\" included specific semi-automatic firearm models by name, and other semi-automatic firearms that possessed two or more from a set certain features:[16]\\r\\nThe ban defined the following semi-automatic firearms, as well as any copies or duplicates of them in any caliber, as assault weapons:\\r\\nGun control advocates and gun rights advocates have referred to at least some of the features outlined in the federal Assault Weapon Ban of 1994 as cosmetic. The NRA Institute for Legislative Action and the Violence Policy Center both used the term in publications they released in September 2004 when the ban expired.[17][18] In May 2012, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence said, \\"the inclusion in the list of features that were purely cosmetic in nature created a loophole that allowed manufacturers to successfully circumvent the law by making minor modifications to the weapons they already produced\\".[19] The term was repeated in several stories after the 2012 Aurora shooting and Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[20][21] Senator Marco Rubio cited this issue during a town hall forum, responding to questions from survivors of the 2018 Stoneman-Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida.[22]\\r\\nA February 2013 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report to Congress said that the \\"Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 was unsuccessfully challenged as violating several constitutional provisions\\". The report said that challenges to three constitutional provisions were easily dismissed.[23]:7 The ban did not make up an impermissible Bill of Attainder.[24]:31 It was not unconstitutionally vague.[25] And it was ruled not incompatible with the Ninth Amendment by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.[26]\\r\\nChallenges to two other provisions took more time to decide.[23]:7\\r\\nIn evaluating challenges to the ban under the Commerce Clause, the court first evaluated Congress' authority to regulate under the clause, and second analyzed the ban's prohibitions on manufacture, transfer, and possession. The court held that \\"it is not even arguable that the manufacture and transfer of 'semiautomatic assault weapons' for a national market cannot be regulated as activity substantially affecting interstate commerce\\".[23]:8ÿ9[24]:12 It also held that the \\"purpose of the ban on possession has an 'evident commercial nexus'\\".[23]:9[24]:14\\r\\nThe law was also challenged under the Equal Protection Clause. It was argued that it banned some semi-automatic weapons that were functional equivalents of exempted semi-automatic weapons and that to do so based upon a mix of other characteristics served no legitimate governmental interest. The reviewing court held that it was \\"entirely rational for Congress ... to choose to ban those weapons commonly used for criminal purposes and to exempt those weapons commonly used for recreational purposes\\".[23]:10[27] It also found that each characteristic served to make the weapon \\"potentially more dangerous\\", and were not \\"commonly used on weapons designed solely for hunting\\".[23]:10ÿ11[28]\\r\\nThe federal assault weapons ban was never directly challenged under the Second Amendment. Since its expiration in 2004 there has been debate on how it would fare in light of cases decided in following years, especially District of Columbia v. Heller (2008).[29]\\r\\nA 2002 study by Koper and Roth found that around the time when the ban became law, assault weapon prices increased significantly, but this increase was reversed in the several months afterward due to a surge in assault weapons production that occurred just before the ban took effect.[2]\\r\\nIn 2003, the Task Force on Community Preventive Services, an independent, non-federal task force, examined an assortment of firearms laws, including the AWB, and found \\"insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws reviewed for preventing violence\\".[30] A 2004 critical review of firearms research by a National Research Council committee said that an academic study of the assault weapon ban \\"did not reveal any clear impacts on gun violence outcomes\\". The committee noted that the study's authors said the guns were used criminally with relative rarity before the ban and that its maximum potential effect on gun violence outcomes would be very small.[1]\\r\\nIn 2004, a research report commissioned by the National Institute of Justice found that should the ban be renewed, its effects on gun violence would likely be small, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement, because rifles in general, including rifles referred to as \\"assault rifles\\" or \\"assault weapons\\", are rarely used in gun crimes. That study by Christopher S. Koper, Daniel J. Woods, and Jeffrey A. Roth of the Jerry Lee Center of Criminology, University of Pennsylvania found no statistically significant evidence that either the assault weapons ban or the ban on magazines holding more than 10 rounds had reduced gun murders. The authors also report that \\"there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury.\\" [31]\\r\\nIn 2004, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence examined the impact of the Assault Weapons Ban, On Target: The Impact of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapon Act. Examining 1.4 million guns involved in crime, \\"in the five-year period before enactment of the Federal Assault Weapons Act (1990ÿ1994), assault weapons named in the Act constituted 4.82% of the crime gun traces ATF conducted nationwide. Since the law's enactment, however, these assault weapons have made up only 1.61% of the guns ATF has traced to crime. Page 10 of the Brady report, however, adds that \\"an evaluation of copycat weapons is necessary\\". Including \\"copycat weapons\\", the report concluded that \\"in the post-ban period, the same group of guns has constituted 3.1% of ATF traces, a decline of 45%.\\"[32] A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) stated that he \\"can in no way vouch for the validity\\" of the report.[33]\\r\\nA study conducted by Dube in 2013, showed that the passing of the FAWB in 1994 had an insignificant impact on violent crime in Mexico, while the expiration of the FAWB in 2004 combined with political instability was correlated with an increase in gun-related homicides among Mexican municipalities near the border.[34] Also in 2013, Koper reviewed the literature on the ban's effects and concluded that its effects on crimes committed with assault weapons were mixed due to its various loopholes. He also concluded that the ban did not seem to affect gun crime rates, but may have been able to reduce shootings if it had been renewed in 2004.[35]\\r\\nResearch by gun advocate John Lott found no impact of these bans on violent crime rates,[36] but provided evidence that the bans may have reduced the number of gun shows by over 20 percent.[37] Koper, Woods, and Roth studies focus on gun murders, while Lott's look at murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assaults. Unlike their work, Lott's research accounted for state assault weapon bans and 12 other different types of gun control laws.\\r\\nIn a 2013 report Samantha Bricknell from the Australian Institute of Criminology, Frederic Lemieux and Tim Prenzler compared mass shootings between America and Australia and found the \\"1996 NFA coincided within the cessation of mass shooting events\\" in Australia, and that there were reductions in America that were evident during the 1994ÿ2004 US Federal Assault Weapon Ban.[3]\\r\\nThe assault weapons ban expired on September 13, 2004. Legislation to renew or replace the ban was proposed numerous times unsuccessfully.\\r\\nBetween May 2003 and June 2008, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, and Representatives Michael Castle, R-DE, Alcee Hastings, D-FL, and Mark Kirk, R-IL, introduced bills to reauthorize the ban.[38] During the same time, Senator Frank Lautenberg, D-NJ, and Representative Carolyn McCarthy, D-NY, introduced similar bills to create a new ban with a revised definition for assault weapons. None of the bills left committee.[39]\\r\\nAfter the November 2008 election, the website of President-elect Barack Obama listed a detailed agenda for the forthcoming administration. The stated positions included \\"making the expired federal Assault Weapons Ban permanent.\\"[40] Three months later, newly sworn-in Attorney General Eric Holder reiterated the Obama administration's desire to reinstate the ban.[41] The mention came in response to a question during a joint press conference with DEA Acting Administrator Michele Leonhart, discussing efforts to crack down on Mexican drug cartels. Attorney General Holder said: \\"... there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make, and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons.\\"[42]\\r\\nEfforts to pass a new federal assault weapons ban were made in December 2012 after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.[43][44][45] On January 24, 2013, Senator Feinstein introduced S. 150, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 (AWB 2013).[46] The bill was similar to the 1994 ban, but differed in that it would not expire after 10 years,[45] and it used a one-feature test for a firearm to qualify as an assault weapon rather than the two-feature test of the defunct ban.[47] The GOP Congressional delegation from Texas, and the NRA, condemned Feinstein's bill.[48] On March 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a version of the bill along party lines.[49] On April 17, 2013, AWB 2013 failed on a Senate vote of 40 to 60.[50]","input":"When was the last assault weapons ban lifted?"},{"output":"Thomas Alva Edison","context":"Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847?ÿ October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman, who has been described as America's greatest inventor.[1] He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park\\",[2] he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.[3]\\r\\nEdison was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. More significant than the number of Edison's patents was the widespread impact of his inventions: electric light and power utilities, sound recording, and motion pictures all established major new industries worldwide. Edison's inventions contributed to mass communication and, in particular, telecommunications. These included a stock ticker, a mechanical vote recorder, a battery for an electric car, electrical power, recorded music and motion pictures. His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison developed a system of electric-power generation and distribution[4] to homes, businesses, and factories ÿ a crucial development in the modern industrialized world. His first power station was on Pearl Street in Manhattan, New York.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, and grew up in Port Huron, Michigan. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804ÿ1896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810ÿ1871, born in Chenango County, New York).[5] His father, the son of a Loyalist refugee, had moved as a boy with the family from Nova Scotia, settling in southwestern Ontario (then called Upper Canada), in a village known as Shewsbury, later Vienna, by 1811. Samuel Jr. eventually fled Ontario, because he took part in the unsuccessful Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837.[6] His father, Samuel Sr., had earlier fought in the War of 1812 as captain of the First Middlesex Regiment. By contrast, Samuel Jr.'s struggle found him on the losing side, and he crossed into the United States at Sarnia-Port Huron. Once across the border, he found his way to Milan, Ohio. His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey; the surname had originally been \\"Edeson.\\"[7]\\r\\nEdison only attended school for a few months and was instead taught by his mother.[8] Much of his education came from reading R.G. Parker's School of Natural Philosophy and The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.[9]\\r\\nEdison developed hearing problems at an early age. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. Around the middle of his career, Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in Smiths Creek, Michigan, along with his apparatus and chemicals. In his later years, he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, lifted him by the ears.[10][11]\\r\\nEdison's family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, after the railroad bypassed Milan in 1854 and business declined.[12] Edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit, and sold vegetables. He briefly worked as a telegraph operator in 1863 for the Grand Trunk Railway at the railway station in Stratford, Ontario, at age 16. He was held responsible for a near collision. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.[13][14]\\r\\nEdison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald, which he sold with his other papers.[14] This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including General Electric, still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.[15][16]\\r\\nEdison became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, station agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway.[17]\\r\\nIn 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimesreading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a leadÿacid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.[18]\\r\\nOne of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home. Some of Edison's earliest inventions were related to telegraphy, including a stock ticker. His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, U.S. Patent 90,646, which was granted on June 1, 1869.[19]\\r\\nOn December 25, 1871, at the age of twenty-four, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855ÿ1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:\\r\\nMary Edison died at age 29 on August 9, 1884, of unknown causes: possibly from a brain tumor[23] or a morphine overdose. Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.[24]\\r\\nEdison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory to being with his family.[25]\\r\\nOn February 24, 1886, at the age of thirty-nine, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865ÿ1947) in Akron, Ohio.[26] She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller, co-founder of the Chautauqua Institution, and a benefactor of Methodist charities. They also had three children together:\\r\\nMina outlived Thomas Edison, dying on August 24, 1947.[30][31]\\r\\nEdison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877.[32] This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park,\\" New Jersey.[2]\\r\\nHis first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as \\"the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other\\".[33] In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes.[34] The Washington Post described Edison as a \\"genius\\" and his presentation as \\"a scene... that will live in history\\".[35] Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878,[36] he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.\\r\\nEdison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($216,300 in today's dollars.[37]), which he gratefully accepted.[38] The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.\\r\\nWilliam Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under General Manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was \\"a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting\\".[39] Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague's contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm's Law, Joule's Law and economics.[40]\\r\\nNearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14-year period. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.[41]\\r\\nIn just over a decade, Edison's Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have \\"a stock of almost every conceivable material\\".[42] A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained \\"eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels?... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell?... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores?...\\" and the list goes on.[43]\\r\\nOver his desk, Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds' famous quotation: \\"There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\\"[44] This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.\\r\\nWith Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application.[45] Edison's name is registered on 1,093 patents.[25]\\r\\nIn 1876, Edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones (at that time called a \\"transmitter\\") by developing a carbon microphone, which consists of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.\\r\\nUp to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by Johann Philipp Reis and Alexander Graham Bell, worked by generating a weak current. The carbon microphone works by modulating a direct current and, subsequently, using a transformer to transfer the signal so generated to the telephone line. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it.[46] His work was concurrent with Emile Berliner's loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitters invention[47]) and David Edward Hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that Hughes did not bother to patent).[46][48]\\r\\nEdison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for Western Union.[47] In 1886, Edison found a way to improve a Bell Telephone microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was roasted. This type was put in use in 1890[47] and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.\\r\\nIt should be noted that the frequency response of the carbon microphone is limited to a narrow frequency range (400?Hz to 4000?Hz), and the device may produce significant electrical noise.\\r\\nIn 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting.[49] He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer,[50] William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich G?bel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially.[51]:217ÿ218 Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).[52]\\r\\nAfter many experiments, first with carbon filaments and then with platinum and other metals, Edison returned to a carbon filament.[53] The first successful test was on October 22, 1879;[51]:186[54][55][25] it lasted 13.5 hours.[56] Edison continued to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using \\"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires\\".[57] This was the first commercially practical incandescent light.[58]\\r\\nAlthough the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including \\"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways\\",[57] it was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered a carbonized bamboo filament that could last over 1,200?hours. The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present-day state of Wyoming, where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29, 1878, from the Continental Divide.[59]\\r\\nIn 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask,[60] and the members of the Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. It was during this time that he said: \\"We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.\\"[61]\\r\\nHenry Villard, president of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, attended Edison's 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard Villard's company's new steamer, the Columbia. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard's request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the Columbia went to New York City, where Edison and his personnel installed Columbia's new lighting system. The Columbia was Edison's first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from Columbia in 1895.[62][63][64][65]\\r\\nLewis Latimer joined the Edison Electric Light Company in 1884. Latimer had received a patent in January 1881 for the \\"Process of Manufacturing Carbons\\", an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for light bulbs. Latimer worked as an engineer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights.[66]\\r\\nGeorge Westinghouse's company bought Philip Diehl's competing induction lamp patent rights (1882) for $25,000, forcing the holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the Edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp.[67]\\r\\nOn October 8, 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison's patent was based on the work of William E. Sawyer and was, therefore, invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years, until October 6, 1889, when a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for \\"a filament of carbon of high resistance\\" was valid.[68] To avoid a possible court battle with Joseph Swan, whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison's, he and Swan formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain.\\r\\nMahen Theatre in Brno (in what is now the Czech Republic), opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use Edison's electric lamps. Francis Jehl, Edison's assistant in the invention of the lamp, supervised the installation.[69] In September 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of the theatre.[70]\\r\\nAfter devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric \\"utility\\" to compete with the existing gas light utilities.[71] On December 17, 1880, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system for electricity distribution. The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station, New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his Pearl Street generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers in lower Manhattan.[72]\\r\\nIn January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London. The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle, New Jersey.\\r\\nAs Edison expanded his direct current (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (AC) systems. From the early 1880s AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885ÿ1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \\"step down\\" the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.[73] Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.\\r\\nEdison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, \\"Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.\\"[74] Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.[75] Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.[76]\\r\\nParallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines. This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.[77][78] Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a \\"battle of currents\\". The development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and smear Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\\r\\nThomas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier J.P. Morgan engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called General Electric. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.[79][80]\\r\\nEdison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine that uses X-rays to take radiographs. Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm R?ntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.\\r\\nThe fundamental design of Edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, Clarence Dally. Dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation. He later died of injuries related to the exposure. In 1903, a shaken Edison said: \\"Don't talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them.\\"[81]\\r\\nThe key to Edison's fortunes was telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity. This allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system. On August 9, 1892, Edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph.\\r\\nEdison was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or \\"Kinetograph\\". He did the electromechanical design while his employee W.?K.?L. Dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson.[51] In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.[83]\\r\\nIn April 1896, Thomas Armat's Vitascope, manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison's name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.\\r\\nOfficially the kinetoscope entered Europe when the rich American Businessman Irving T. Bush (1869ÿ1948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kintoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-?sterreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck[84] of the Schokoladen-Ssswarenfabrik Stollwerck & Co of Cologne.\\r\\nThe first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895. The Edison's Kintoscope Fran?ais, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists.[85]\\r\\nOn May 14, 1895, the Edison's Kintoscope Belge was founded in Brussels. The businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. In 1898, he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.[85]\\r\\nEdison's film studio made close to 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as Fred Ott's Sneeze (1894), The Kiss (1896), The Great Train Robbery (1903), Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1910), and the first Frankenstein film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island announced they would execute Topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title Electrocuting an Elephant.\\r\\nAs the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other's films.[86] To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the U.S. copyright office. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.[87]\\r\\nIn 1908, Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust). Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, which was founded in 1929.\\r\\nEdison said his favorite movie was The Birth of a Nation. He thought that talkies had \\"spoiled everything\\" for him. \\"There isn't any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf.\\"[88] His favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow.[89]\\r\\nStarting in the late 1870s, Thomas Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the Edison Ore Milling Company, Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.[90]\\r\\nIn 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.[91] A street in Falconbridge, as well as the Edison Building, which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines, are named for him.\\r\\nThe Edison Storage Battery Company was founded in 1901. With this company Edison exploited his invention of the accumulator. In 1904 already 450 people worked at the company. The first accumulators were produced for electric cars. But there were several defects. Several Customers were complaining about the products. When the capital of the company was spent Edison paid for the company with his private money. Not until 1910 Edison showed a mature product: A Nickel-Iron-Battery with Lye as liquid.\\r\\nEdison became concerned with America's reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber. He joined Harvey Firestone and Henry Ford (each contributing $25,000) to create the Edison Botanic Research Corp. in 1927 and constructed a laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida the following year. Edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part Acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder.[92] After testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant.\\r\\nEdison moved from Menlo Park after the death of his first wife, Mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as \\"Glenmont\\" in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, Mina, in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey. In 1885, Thomas Edison bought property in Fort Myers, Florida, and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat. Edison and Mina spent many winters at their home in Fort Myers, and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.[93]\\r\\nDue to the security concerns around World War I, Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the Naval Consulting Board in 1915.[94]\\r\\nEdison's work on rubber took place largely at his botanic research laboratory in Fort Myers, which has been designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark.[95] The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. After testing over 17,000 plant species, Edison decided on Solidago leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3ÿ4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.[96]\\r\\nWanting to be an inventor, but not having much of an aptitude for it, Thomas Edison's son, Thomas Alva Edison Jr.. became a problem for his father and his father's business. Starting in the 1890s, Thomas Jr. became involved in snake oil products and shady and fraudulent enterprises producing products being sold to the public as \\"The Latest Edison Discovery\\". The situation became so bad that Thomas Sr. had to take his son to court to stop the practices, finally agreeing to pay Thomas Jr. an allowance of $35.00 (equivalent to $953 in 2017[37]) per week, in exchange for not using the Edison name; the son began using aliases, such as Burton Willard. Thomas Jr., suffering from alcoholism, depression and ill health, worked at several menial jobs, but by 1931 (towards the end of his life) he would obtain a role in the Edison company, thanks to the intervention of his brother.[97][98]\\r\\nHenry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and John Burroughs also participated.\\r\\nIn 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that \\"The Civitan Club is doing thingsbig thingsfor the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks.\\"[99] He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club's meetings.\\r\\nEdison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange.[100]\\r\\nThis fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison's inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by New Jersey Transit.[100]\\r\\nEdison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years; \\"the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours\\".[51] He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, \\"correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.\\" She also said that during one of his periodic \\"great scientific adventures\\", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.[88]\\r\\nEdison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906. On his last visit, in 1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles.[citation needed]\\r\\nEdison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, \\"Glenmont\\" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina. He is buried behind the home.[101][102]\\r\\nEdison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at The Henry Ford museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a memento.[103] A plaster death mask and casts of Edison's hands were also made.[104] Mina died in 1947.\\r\\nHistorian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a \\"freethinker\\".[51] Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason.[51] Edison defended Paine's \\"scientific deism\\", saying, \\"He has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity.\\"[51] In an October 2, 1910, interview in the New York Times Magazine, Edison stated:\\r\\nNature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me? the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love? He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us? nature did it all? not the gods of the religions.[105]\\r\\nEdison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter:\\r\\nYou have misunderstood the whole article, because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter. All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are made.[51]\\r\\nHe also stated, \\"I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt.\\"[106]\\r\\nNonviolence was key to Edison's moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, \\"I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill.\\" Edison's philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which he stated: \\"Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages.\\"[107][108] He was a vegetarian[109] but not a vegan in actual practice, at least near the end of his life.[51]\\r\\nIn 1920, Edison set off a media sensation when he told B. C. Forbes of American Magazine that he was working on a \\"spirit phone\\" to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated.[110] Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the New York Times in 1926 that \\"I really had nothing to tell him, but I hated to disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke.\\"[111]\\r\\nThomas Edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States. He was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money. Famously, he was quoted in the New York Times stating \\"Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar, and interest is an invention of Satan.\\"[112]\\r\\nIn the same article, he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. His basic point was that, if the Government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.[112]\\r\\nHe thought at length about the subject of money in 1921 and 1922. In May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled \\"A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System\\".[113] In it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, Henry Ford, he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals. In the end, however, Edison's proposals failed to find support and were eventually abandoned.[114][115]\\r\\nThe President of the Third French Republic, Jules Grvy, on the recommendation of his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jules Barthlemy-Saint-Hilaire, and with the presentations of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Louis Cochery, designated Edison with the distinction of an Officer of the Legion of Honour (Lgion d'honneur) by decree on November 10, 1881;[116] Edison was also named a Chevalier in the Legion in 1879, and a Commander in 1889.[117]\\r\\nIn 1887, Edison won the Matteucci Medal. In 1890, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\\r\\nThe Philadelphia City Council named Edison the recipient of the John Scott Medal in 1889.[117]\\r\\nIn 1899, Edison was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of The Franklin Institute.[118]\\r\\nHe was named an Honorable Consulting Engineer at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition World's fair in 1904.[117]\\r\\nIn 1908, Edison received the American Association of Engineering Societies John Fritz Medal.[117]\\r\\nIn 1915, Edison was awarded Franklin Medal of The Franklin Institute for discoveries contributing to the foundation of industries and the well-being of the human race.[119]\\r\\nIn 1920, the United States Navy department awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.[117]\\r\\nIn 1923, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers created the Edison Medal and he was its first recipient.[117]\\r\\nIn 1927, he was granted membership in the National Academy of Sciences.[117]\\r\\nOn May 29, 1928, Edison received the Congressional Gold Medal.[117]\\r\\nIn 1983, the United States Congress, pursuant to Senate Joint Resolution 140 (Public Law 97198), designated February 11, Edison's birthday, as National Inventor's Day.[120]\\r\\nLife magazine (USA), in a special double issue in 1997, placed Edison first in the list of the \\"100 Most Important People in the Last 1000 Years\\", noting that the light bulb he promoted \\"lit up the world\\". In the 2005 television series The Greatest American, he was voted by viewers as the fifteenth greatest.\\r\\nIn 2008, Edison was inducted in the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\\r\\nIn 2010, Edison was honored with a Technical Grammy Award.\\r\\nIn 2011, Edison was inducted into the Entrepreneur Walk of Fame and named a Great Floridian by the Florida Governor and Cabinet.[121]\\r\\nSeveral places have been named after Edison, most notably the town of Edison, New Jersey. Thomas Edison State University, nationally known for adult learners, is in Trenton, New Jersey. Two community colleges are named for him: Edison State College (now Florida SouthWestern State College) in Fort Myers, Florida, and Edison Community College in Piqua, Ohio.[122] There are numerous high schools named after Edison (see Edison High School) and other schools including Thomas A. Edison Middle School. Footballer Pel's father originally named him Edson, as a tribute to the inventor of the light bulb, but the name was incorrectly listed on his birth certificate as \\"Edison\\".[123]\\r\\nThe small town of Alva just east of Fort Myers took Edison's middle name.\\r\\nIn 1883, the City Hotel in Sunbury, Pennsylvania was the first building to be lit with Edison's three-wire system. The hotel was renamed The Hotel Edison upon Edison's return to the city on 1922.[124]\\r\\nLake Thomas A Edison in California was named after Edison to mark the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb.[125]\\r\\nEdison was on hand to turn on the lights at the Hotel Edison in New York City when it opened in 1931.[126]\\r\\nThree bridges around the United States have been named in Edison's honor: the Edison Bridge in New Jersey,[127] the Edison Bridge in Florida,[128] and the Edison Bridge in Ohio.[129]\\r\\nIn space, his name is commemorated in asteroid 742 Edisona.\\r\\nIn West Orange, New Jersey, the 13.5 acres (5.5 hectares) Glenmont estate is maintained and operated by the National Park Service as the Edison National Historic Site, as is his nearby laboratory and workshops including the reconstructed \\"Black Maria\\"the world's first movie studio.[130] The Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum is in the town of Edison, New Jersey.[131] In Beaumont, Texas, there is an Edison Museum, though Edison never visited there.[132] The Port Huron Museum, in Port Huron, Michigan, restored the original depot that Thomas Edison worked out of as a young news butcher. The depot has been named the Thomas Edison Depot Museum.[133] The town has many Edison historical landmarks, including the graves of Edison's parents, and a monument along the St. Clair River. Edison's influence can be seen throughout this city of 32,000.\\r\\nIn Detroit, the Edison Memorial Fountain in Grand Circus Park was created to honor his achievements. The limestone fountain was dedicated October 21, 1929, the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the lightbulb.[134] On the same night, The Edison Institute was dedicated in nearby Dearborn.\\r\\nHe was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1969.[citation needed]\\r\\nA bronze statue of Edison was placed in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol in 2016, with the formal dedication ceremony held on September 20 of that year. The Edison statue replaced one of 19th-century state governor William Allen that had been one of Ohio's two allowed contributions to the collection.[135]\\r\\nThe Edison Medal was created on February 11, 1904, by a group of Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), later IEEE, entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. It is the oldest award in the area of electrical and electronics engineering, and is presented annually \\"for a career of meritorious achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering or the electrical arts.\\"\\r\\nIn the Netherlands, the major music awards are named the Edison Award after him. The award is an annual Dutch music prize, awarded for outstanding achievements in the music industry, and is one of the oldest music awards in the world, having been presented since 1960.\\r\\nThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers concedes the Thomas A. Edison Patent Award to individual patents since 2000.[136]\\r\\nThe United States Navy named the USS Edison (DD-439), a Gleaves class destroyer, in his honor in 1940. The ship was decommissioned a few months after the end of World War II.[137] In 1962, the Navy commissioned USS Thomas A. Edison (SSBN-610), a fleet ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarine.[citation needed][138]\\r\\nThomas Edison has appeared in popular culture as a character in novels, films, comics and video games. His prolific inventing helped make him an icon and he has made appearances in popular culture during his lifetime down to the present day. Edison is also portrayed in popular culture as an adversary of Nikola Tesla.[139]\\r\\n\\"Camping with Henry and Tom\\", a fictional play based on Edison's camping trips with Henry Ford, written by Mark St.Gemain.

In October 1926, she married Giovanni Martinuzzi[10] (1901ÿ1978), and her only child was born in 1937 but died when he was only six months old. The marriage was not a happy one,[11] so in 1938 Morano separated from her husband, driving him out of the house; he died in 1978.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 1954 Morano worked at Maioni Industry, a jute factory in her town.

It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as \\"ice giants\\" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more \\"ices\\" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.[12] It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49?K (?224?C; ?371?F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.[12] The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.[11]\\r\\nUranus is the only planet whose name is derived directly from a figure from Greek mythology, from the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky Ouranos. Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration among those of the planets because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators.[16] In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets.[16] Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900?km/h; 560?mph).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.[18] Sir William Herschel announced its discovery on 13 March 1781, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in history and making Uranus the first planet discovered with a telescope.\\r\\n\\r\\nUranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchos, who in 128 BC might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's Almagest.[19] The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769,[20] including on four consecutive nights.\\r\\nSir William Herschel observed Uranus on 13 March 1781 from the garden of his house at 19 New King Street in Bath, Somerset, England (now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy),[21] and initially reported it (on 26 April 1781) as a comet.[22] Herschel \\"engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars\\",[23] using a telescope of his own design.\\r\\nHerschel recorded in his journal: \\"In the quartile near  Tauri?... either [a] Nebulous star or perhaps a comet.\\"[24] On 17 March he noted: \\"I looked for the Comet or Nebulous Star and found that it is a Comet, for it has changed its place.\\"[25] When he presented his discovery to the Royal Society, he continued to assert that he had found a comet, but also implicitly compared it to a planet:[23]\\r\\nThe power I had on when I first saw the comet was 227. From experience I know that the diameters of the fixed stars are not proportionally magnified with higher powers, as planets are; therefore I now put the powers at 460 and 932, and found that the diameter of the comet increased in proportion to the power, as it ought to be, on the supposition of its not being a fixed star, while the diameters of the stars to which I compared it were not increased in the same ratio. Moreover, the comet being magnified much beyond what its light would admit of, appeared hazy and ill-defined with these great powers, while the stars preserved that lustre and distinctness which from many thousand observations I knew they would retain. The sequel has shown that my surmises were well-founded, this proving to be the Comet we have lately observed.[23]\\r\\nHerschel notified the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on 23 April 1781: \\"I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it.\\"[26]\\r\\nAlthough Herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet, other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to compute the orbit of the new object.[27] Its nearly circular orbit led him to a conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode described Herschel's discovery as \\"a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn\\".[28] Bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet than a comet.[29]\\r\\nThe object was soon universally accepted as a new planet. By 1783, Herschel acknowledged this to Royal Society president Joseph Banks: \\"By the observation of the most eminent Astronomers in Europe it appears that the new star, which I had the honour of pointing out to them in March 1781, is a Primary Planet of our Solar System.\\"[30] In recognition of his achievement, King George III gave Herschel an annual stipend of S200 on condition that he move to Windsor so that the Royal Family could look through his telescopes.[31]\\r\\nThe name of Uranus references the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus (Ancient Greek: Ѯ?ϫ??), the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter), which in Latin became \\"ranus\\" (Latin pronunciation:?[?u?ran?s]).[1] It is the only planet whose name is derived directly from a figure of Greek mythology. The adjectival form of Uranus is \\"Uranian\\".[32] The pronunciation of the name Uranus preferred among astronomers is /?j??r?n?s/,[2] with stress on the first syllable as in Latin ranus, in contrast to /j???re?n?s/, with stress on the second syllable and a long a, though both are considered acceptable.[f]\\r\\nConsensus on the name was not reached until almost 70 years after the planet's discovery. During the original discussions following discovery, Maskelyne asked Herschel to \\"do the astronomical world the faver  [sic] to give a name to your planet, which is entirely your own, [and] which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of\\".[34] In response to Maskelyne's request, Herschel decided to name the object Georgium Sidus (George's Star), or the \\"Georgian Planet\\" in honour of his new patron, King George III.[35] He explained this decision in a letter to Joseph Banks:[30]\\r\\nIn the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were given to the Planets, as being the names of their principal heroes and divinities. In the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same method and call it Juno, Pallas, Apollo or Minerva, for a name to our new heavenly body. The first consideration of any particular event, or remarkable incident, seems to be its chronology: if in any future age it should be asked, when this last-found Planet was discovered? It would be a very satisfactory answer to say, 'In the reign of King George the Third'.\\r\\nHerschel's proposed name was not popular outside Britain, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer Jr?me Lalande proposed that it be named Herschel in honour of its discoverer.[36] Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the name Neptune, which was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet in the course of the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even Neptune George III or Neptune Great Britain.[27]\\r\\nIn a March 1782 treatise, Bode proposed Uranus, the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos.[37] Bode argued that the name should follow the mythology so as not to stand out as different from the other planets, and that Uranus was an appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the Titans.[37] He also noted that elegance of the name in that just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of Saturn.[31][37][38][39] In 1789, Bode's Royal Academy colleague Martin Klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of Bode's choice.[40] Ultimately, Bode's suggestion became the most widely used, and became universal in 1850 when HM Nautical Almanac Office, the final holdout, switched from using Georgium Sidus to Uranus.[38]\\r\\nUranus has two astronomical symbols. The first to be proposed, ?,[g] was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as \\"un globe surmont par la premire lettre de votre nom\\" (\\"a globe surmounted by the first letter of your surname\\").[36] A later proposal, ?,[h] is a hybrid of the symbols for Mars and the Sun because Uranus was the Sky in Greek mythology, which was thought to be dominated by the combined powers of the Sun and Mars.[41]\\r\\nUranus is called by a variety of translations in other languages. In Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, its name is literally translated as the \\"sky king star\\" (tx).[42][43][44][45] In Thai, its official name is Dao Yurenat (??????????), as in English. Its other name in Thai is Dao Maritayu (????????, Star of M?tyu), after the Sanskrit word for \\"death\\", Mrtyu (??????). In Mongolian, its name is Tengeriin Van (׸ķ̸İҳ ־), translated as \\"King of the Sky\\", reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the heavens. In Hawaiian, its name is Heleekala. In Mori, its name is Whrangi.[46][47]\\r\\nUranus orbits the Sun once every 84 years. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 20?AU (3?billion?km; 2?billion?mi). The difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that of pluto, the nearest dwarf planet.[48] The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance, and so on Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth) it is about 1/400 the intensity of light on Earth.[49] Its orbital elements were first calculated in 1783 by Pierre-Simon Laplace.[50] With time, discrepancies began to appear between the predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, John Couch Adams first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On 23 September 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle located a new planet, later named Neptune, at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.[51]\\r\\nThe rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17?hours, 14?minutes. As on all the giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60 degrees south, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.[52]\\r\\nThe Uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the Solar System, with an axial tilt of 97.77 (as defined by prograde rotation). This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets. Near the solstice, one pole faces the Sun continuously and the other faces away. Only a narrow strip around the equator experiences a rapid dayÿnight cycle, but with the Sun low over the horizon. At the other side of Uranus's orbit the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed. Each pole gets around 42?years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42?years of darkness.[53] Near the time of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator of Uranus giving a period of dayÿnight cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets.\\r\\nUranus reached its most recent equinox on 7 December 2007.[54][55]\\r\\nOne result of this axis orientation is that, averaged over the Uranian year, the polar regions of Uranus receive a greater energy input from the Sun than its equatorial regions. Nevertheless, Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. The underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized protoplanet collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.[56] Uranus's south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun at the time of Voyager?2's flyby in 1986. The labelling of this pole as \\"south\\" uses the definition currently endorsed by the International Astronomical Union, namely that the north pole of a planet or satellite is the pole that points above the invariable plane of the Solar System, regardless of the direction the planet is spinning.[57][58] A different convention is sometimes used, in which a body's north and south poles are defined according to the right-hand rule in relation to the direction of rotation.[59]\\r\\nFrom 1995 to 2006, Uranus's apparent magnitude fluctuated between +5.6 and +5.9, placing it just within the limit of naked eye visibility at +6.5.[13] Its angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7?arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20?arcseconds for Saturn and 32 to 45?arcseconds for Jupiter.[13] At opposition, Uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars.[5] In larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23?cm, Uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening. With a large telescope of 25?cm or wider, cloud patterns, as well as some of the larger satellites, such as Titania and Oberon, may be visible.[60]\\r\\nUranus's mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, making it the least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than Neptune's at roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of 1.27?g/cm3 makes Uranus the second least dense planet, after Saturn.[8][9] This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.[11] The total mass of ice in Uranus's interior is not precisely known, because different figures emerge depending on the model chosen; it must be between 9.3?and 13.5?Earth masses.[11][61] Hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of the total, with between 0.5 and 1.5?Earth masses.[11] The remainder of the non-ice mass (0.5 to 3.7?Earth masses) is accounted for by rocky material.[11]\\r\\nThe standard model of Uranus's structure is that it consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/ironÿnickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope.[11][62] The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55?Earth masses and a radius less than 20% of Uranus's; the mantle comprises its bulk, with around 13.4?Earth masses, and the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about 0.5?Earth masses and extending for the last 20% of Uranus's radius.[11][62] Uranus's core density is around 9?g/cm3, with a pressure in the centre of 8?million?bars (800 GPa) and a temperature of about 5000?K.[61][62] The ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other volatiles.[11][62] This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a waterÿammonia ocean.[63]\\r\\nThe extreme pressure and temperature deep within Uranus may break up the methane molecules, with the carbon atoms condensing into crystals of diamond that rain down through the mantle like hailstones.[64][65][66] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of liquid diamond, with floating solid 'diamond-bergs'.[67][68]\\r\\nThe bulk compositions of Uranus and Neptune are different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with ice dominating over gases, hence justifying their separate classification as ice giants. There may be a layer of ionic water where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions move freely within the oxygen lattice.[69]\\r\\nAlthough the model considered above is reasonably standard, it is not unique; other models also satisfy observations. For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination which model is correct.[61] The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers.[11] For the sake of convenience, a revolving oblate spheroid set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1?bar (100 kPa) is conditionally designated as a \\"surface\\". It has equatorial and polar radii of 25,559?I?4?km (15,881.6?I?2.5?mi) and 24,973?I?20?km (15,518?I?12?mi), respectively.[8] This surface is used throughout this article as a zero point for altitudes.\\r\\nUranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low thermal flux.[17][70] Why Uranus's internal temperature is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun,[17] but Uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is 7000106000000000000?1.06I0.08 times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere.[12][71] Uranus's heat flux is only 6998420000000000000?0.042I0.047?W/m2, which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 6998750000000000000?0.075?W/m2.[71] The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49?K (?224.2?C; ?371.5?F), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.[12][71]\\r\\nOne of the hypotheses for this discrepancy suggests that when Uranus was hit by a supermassive impactor, which caused it to expel most of its primordial heat, it was left with a depleted core temperature.[72] This impact hypothesis is also used in some attempts to explain the planet's axial tilt. Another hypothesis is that some form of barrier exists in Uranus's upper layers that prevents the core's heat from reaching the surface.[11] For example, convection may take place in a set of compositionally different layers, which may inhibit the upward heat transport;[12][71] perhaps double diffusive convection is a limiting factor.[11]\\r\\nAlthough there is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus's interior, the outermost part of Uranus's gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere.[12] Remote-sensing capability extends down to roughly 300?km below the 1?bar (100?kPa) level, with a corresponding pressure around 100?bar (10?MPa) and temperature of 320?K (47?C; 116?F).[73] The tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar.[74] The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of ?300 and 50?km (?186 and 31?mi) and pressures from 100 to 0.1?bar (10?MPa to 10?kPa); the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between 50 and 4,000?km (31 and 2,485?mi) and pressures of between 0.1 and 10?10?bar (10?kPa to 10?Pa); and the thermosphere extending from 4,000?km to as high as 50,000?km from the surface.[12] There is no mesosphere.\\r\\nThe composition of Uranus's atmosphere is different from its bulk, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium.[12] The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms per molecule of gas, is 6999150000000000000?0.15I0.03[15] in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to a mass fraction 6999260000000000000?0.26I0.05.[12][71] This value is close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of 6999275000000000000?0.275I0.01,[75] indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in the gas giants.[12] The third-most-abundant component of Uranus's atmosphere is methane (CH\\r\\n4).[12] Methane has prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared (IR), making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour.[12] Methane molecules account for 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the methane cloud deck at the pressure level of 1.3?bar (130?kPa); this represents about 20 to 30?times the carbon abundance found in the Sun.[12][14][76] The mixing ratio[i] is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out.[77] The abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere are poorly known. They are probably also higher than solar values.[12][78] Along with methane, trace amounts of various hydrocarbons are found in the stratosphere of Uranus, which are thought to be produced from methane by photolysis induced by the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.[79] They include ethane (C\\r\\n2H\\r\\n6), acetylene (C\\r\\n2H\\r\\n2), methylacetylene (CH\\r\\n3C\\r\\n2H), and diacetylene (C\\r\\n2HC\\r\\n2H).[77][80][81] Spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapour, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere, which can only originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets.[80][81][82]\\r\\nThe troposphere is the lowest and densest part of the atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in temperature with altitude.[12] The temperature falls from about 320?K (47?C; 116?F) at the base of the nominal troposphere at ?300?km to 53?K (?220?C; ?364?F) at 50?km.[73][76] The temperatures in the coldest upper region of the troposphere (the tropopause) actually vary in the range between 49 and 57?K (?224 and ?216?C; ?371 and ?357?F) depending on planetary latitude.[12][70] The tropopause region is responsible for the vast majority of Uranus's thermal far infrared emissions, thus determining its effective temperature of 59.1?I?0.3?K (?214.1?I?0.3?C; ?353.3?I?0.5?F).[70][71]\\r\\nThe troposphere is thought to have a highly complex cloud structure; water clouds are hypothesised to lie in the pressure range of 50 to 100?bar (5 to 10?MPa), ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in the range of 20 to 40?bar (2 to 4?MPa), ammonia or hydrogen sulfide clouds at between 3 and 10?bar (0.3 and 1?MPa) and finally directly detected thin methane clouds at 1 to 2?bar (0.1 to 0.2?MPa).[12][14][73][83] The troposphere is a dynamic part of the atmosphere, exhibiting strong winds, bright clouds and seasonal changes.[17]\\r\\nThe middle layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the stratosphere, where temperature generally increases with altitude from 53?K (?220?C; ?364?F) in the tropopause to between 800 and 850?K (527 and 577?C; 980 and 1,070?F) at the base of the thermosphere.[74] The heating of the stratosphere is caused by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons,[85] which form in this part of the atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis.[79] Heat is also conducted from the hot thermosphere.[85] The hydrocarbons occupy a relatively narrow layer at altitudes of between 100 and 300?km corresponding to a pressure range of 10 to 0.1?mbar (10.00 to 0.10?hPa) and temperatures of between 75 and 170?K (?198 and ?103?C; ?325 and ?154?F).[77][80] The most abundant hydrocarbons are methane, acetylene and ethane with mixing ratios of around 10?7 relative to hydrogen. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is similar at these altitudes.[77][80][82] Heavier hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide have mixing ratios three orders of magnitude lower.[80] The abundance ratio of water is around 7G10?9.[81] Ethane and acetylene tend to condense in the colder lower part of stratosphere and tropopause (below 10?mBar level) forming haze layers,[79] which may be partly responsible for the bland appearance of Uranus. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian stratosphere above the haze is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets.[77][86]\\r\\nThe outermost layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the thermosphere and corona, which has a uniform temperature around 800 to 850?K.[12][86] The heat sources necessary to sustain such a high level are not understood, as neither the solar UV nor the auroral activity can provide the necessary energy to maintain these temperatures. The weak cooling efficiency due to the lack of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere above 0.1?mBar pressure level may contribute too.[74][86] In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere-corona contains many free hydrogen atoms. Their small mass and high temperatures explain why the corona extends as far as 50,000?km (31,000?mi), or two Uranian radii, from its surface.[74][86] This extended corona is a unique feature of Uranus.[86] Its effects include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings.[74] The Uranian thermosphere, together with the upper part of the stratosphere, corresponds to the ionosphere of Uranus.[76] Observations show that the ionosphere occupies altitudes from 2,000 to 10,000?km (1,200 to 6,200?mi).[76] The Uranian ionosphere is denser than that of either Saturn or Neptune, which may arise from the low concentration of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere.[86][87] The ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar UV radiation and its density depends on the solar activity.[88] Auroral activity is insignificant as compared to Jupiter and Saturn.[86][89]\\r\\nTemperature profile of the Uranian troposphere and lower stratosphere. Cloud and haze layers are also indicated.\\r\\nZonal wind speeds on Uranus. Shaded areas show the southern collar and its future northern counterpart. The red curve is a symmetrical fit to the data.\\r\\nBefore the arrival of Voyager 2, no measurements of the Uranian magnetosphere had been taken, so its nature remained a mystery. Before 1986, scientists had expected the magnetic field of Uranus to be in line with the solar wind, because it would then align with Uranus's poles that lie in the ecliptic.[90]\\r\\nVoyager's observations revealed that Uranus's magnetic field is peculiar, both because it does not originate from its geometric centre, and because it is tilted at 59 from the axis of rotation.[90][91] In fact the magnetic dipole is shifted from the Uranus's centre towards the south rotational pole by as much as one third of the planetary radius.[90] This unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where the magnetic field strength on the surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as 0.1?gauss (10?T), whereas in the northern hemisphere it can be as high as 1.1?gauss (110?T).[90] The average field at the surface is 0.23?gauss (23?T).[90] Studies of Voyager 2 data in 2017 suggest that this asymmetry causes Uranus's magnetosphere to connect with the solar wind once a Uranian day, opening the planet to the Sun's particles.[92] In comparison, the magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its \\"magnetic equator\\" is roughly parallel with its geographical equator.[91] The dipole moment of Uranus is 50?times that of Earth.[90][91] Neptune has a similarly displaced and tilted magnetic field, suggesting that this may be a common feature of ice giants.[91] One hypothesis is that, unlike the magnetic fields of the terrestrial and gas giants, which are generated within their cores, the ice giants' magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow depths, for instance, in the waterÿammonia ocean.[63][93] Another possible explanation for the magnetosphere's alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in Uranus's interior that would deter the magnetic field.[67]\\r\\nDespite its curious alignment, in other respects the Uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets: it has a bow shock at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it, a magnetopause at 18 Uranian radii, a fully developed magnetotail, and radiation belts.[90][91][94] Overall, the structure of Uranus's magnetosphere is different from Jupiter's and more similar to Saturn's.[90][91] Uranus's magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew.[90][95]\\r\\nUranus's magnetosphere contains charged particles: mainly protons and electrons, with a small amount of H2+ ions.[91][94] No heavier ions have been detected. Many of these particles probably derive from the thermosphere.[94] The ion and electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1.2?megaelectronvolts, respectively.[94] The density of low-energy (below 1?kiloelectronvolt) ions in the inner magnetosphere is about 2?cm?3.[96] The particle population is strongly affected by the Uranian moons, which sweep through the magnetosphere, leaving noticeable gaps.[94] The particle flux is high enough to cause darkening or space weathering of their surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of 100,000?years.[94] This may be the cause of the uniformly dark colouration of the Uranian satellites and rings.[97] Uranus has relatively well developed aurorae, which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles.[86] Unlike Jupiter's, Uranus's aurorae seem to be insignificant for the energy balance of the planetary thermosphere.[89]\\r\\nAt ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, Uranus's atmosphere is bland in comparison to the other giant planets, even to Neptune, which it otherwise closely resembles.[17] When Voyager 2 flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of ten cloud features across the entire planet.[16][98] One proposed explanation for this dearth of features is that Uranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets. The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49?K (?224?C; ?371?F), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.[12][71]\\r\\nIn 1986, Voyager 2 found that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands.[16] Their boundary is located at about ?45 of latitude. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from ?45 to ?50 is the brightest large feature on its visible surface.[16][99] It is called a southern \\"collar\\". The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2?bar (see above).[100] Besides the large-scale banded structure, Voyager?2 observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar.[16] In all other respects Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986. Voyager?2 arrived during the height of Uranus's southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. At the beginning of the 21st century, when the northern polar region came into view, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere.[99] So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar.[99] In 2007, when Uranus passed its equinox, the southern collar almost disappeared, and a faint northern collar emerged near 45 of latitude.[101]\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably partly because new high-resolution imaging techniques became available.[17] Most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible.[17] An early explanationthat bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them ÿ was shown to be incorrect.[102][103] Nevertheless there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter.[103] They appear to lie at a higher altitude.[103] The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours; at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the Voyager 2 flyby.[17][98] Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune.[17] For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed Uranus Dark Spot was imaged.[104] The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.[105]\\r\\nThe tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in the upper troposphere of Uranus.[17] At the equator winds are retrograde, which means that they blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from ?360 to ?180?km/h (?220 to ?110?mph).[17][99] Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near I20 latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located.[17][70] Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus's rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at I60 latitude before falling to zero at the poles.[17] Wind speeds at ?40 latitude range from 540 to 720?km/h (340 to 450?mph). Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the southern pole are impossible to measure.[17] In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 860?km/h (540?mph) are observed near +50 latitude.[17][99][106]\\r\\nFor a short period from March to May 2004, large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a Neptune-like appearance.[103][107] Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of 820?km/h (510?mph) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as \\"Fourth of July fireworks\\".[98] On 23 August 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, Colorado) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus's surface, giving scientists more insight into Uranus's atmospheric activity.[104] Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known, but it appears that Uranus's extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather.[55][105] Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus's atmosphere have existed for less than 84 years, or one full Uranian year. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes.[108] A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.[109] Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice.[85] The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in the viewing geometry.[102]\\r\\nThere are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above.[105] During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim.[108] This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox.[105] Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the meridional albedo patterns.[105] In the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright),[100] whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity,[98] such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon.[103] This indeed happened in 2007 when it passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, and the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.[101]\\r\\nThe mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.[105] Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere.[100] The bright collar at ?45 latitude is also connected with methane clouds.[100] Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.[100] The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.[110] Now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.[98][110]\\r\\nMany argue that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants extend to their formation.[111][112] The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a giant rotating ball of gas and dust known as the presolar nebula. Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula's leftover gas.[111][112] The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially. The ice giants, with only a few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point.[111][112][113] Recent simulations of planetary migration have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present positions, and moved outwards after formation (the Nice model).[111]\\r\\nUranus has 27 known natural satellites.[113] The names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.[62][114] The five main satellites are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.[62] The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of Triton (largest moon of Neptune) alone.[9] The largest of Uranus's satellites, Titania, has a radius of only 788.9?km (490.2?mi), or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System. Uranus's satellites have relatively low albedos; ranging from 0.20 for Umbriel to 0.35 for Ariel (in green light).[16] They are iceÿrock conglomerates composed of roughly 50% ice and 50% rock. The ice may include ammonia and carbon dioxide.[97][115]\\r\\nAmong the Uranian satellites, Ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters and Umbriel's the oldest.[16][97] Miranda has fault canyons 20?km (12?mi) deep, terraced layers, and a chaotic variation in surface ages and features.[16] Miranda's past geologic activity is thought to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently, probably as a result of a former 3:1 orbital resonance with Umbriel.[116] Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are the likely origin of Miranda's 'racetrack'-like coronae.[117][118] Ariel is thought to have once been held in a 4:1 resonance with Titania.[119]\\r\\nUranus has at least one horseshoe orbiter occupying the SunÿUranus L3 Lagrangian pointa gravitationally unstable region at 180 in its orbit, 83982 Crantor.[120][121] Crantor moves inside Uranus's co-orbital region on a complex, temporary horseshoe orbit. 2010 EU65 is also a promising Uranus horseshoe librator candidate.[121]\\r\\nThe Uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre.[16] Thirteen distinct rings are presently known, the brightest being the  ring. All except two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow ÿ they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts, only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings.[97][122]\\r\\nWilliam Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun.[123][124] The ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 (also known as HD 128598) by Uranus to study its atmosphere. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus.[125] Later they detected four additional rings.[125] The rings were directly imaged when Voyager?2 passed Uranus in 1986.[16] Voyager?2 also discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.[16]\\r\\nIn December 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus that they are called the \\"outer\\" ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, Mab, shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian rings to 13.[126] In April 2006, images of the new rings from the Keck Observatory yielded the colours of the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red.[127][128] One hypothesis concerning the outer ring's blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are small enough to scatter blue light.[127][129] In contrast, Uranus's inner rings appear grey.[127]\\r\\nAnimation about the discovering occultation in 1977.

This flyby remains the only investigation of Uranus carried out from a short distance and no other visits are planned. Launched in 1977, Voyager 2 made its closest approach to Uranus on 24 January 1986, coming within 81,500?km (50,600?mi) of the cloudtops, before continuing its journey to Neptune. The spacecraft studied the structure and chemical composition of Uranus's atmosphere,[76] including its unique weather, caused by its axial tilt of 97.77. It made the first detailed investigations of its five largest moons and discovered 10 new ones. It examined all nine of the system's known rings and discovered two more.[16][97][130] It also studied the magnetic field, its irregular structure, its tilt and its unique corkscrew magnetotail caused by Uranus's sideways orientation.[90]\\r\\nVoyager 1 was unable to visit Uranus because investigation of Saturn's moon Titan was considered a priority. This trajectory took Voyager 1 out of the plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission.[131]:118\\r\\nThe possibility of sending the Cassini spacecraft from Saturn to Uranus was evaluated during a mission extension planning phase in 2009, but was ultimately rejected in favour of destroying it in the Saturnian atmosphere.[132] It would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn.[132] A Uranus orbiter and probe was recommended by the 2013ÿ2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey published in 2011; the proposal envisages launch during 2020ÿ2023 and a 13-year cruise to Uranus.[133] A Uranus entry probe could use Pioneer Venus Multiprobe heritage and descend to 1ÿ5 atmospheres.[133] The ESA evaluated a \\"medium-class\\" mission called Uranus Pathfinder.[134] A New Frontiers Uranus Orbiter has been evaluated and recommended in the study, The Case for a Uranus Orbiter.[135] Such a mission is aided by the ease with which a relatively big mass can be sent to the systemover 1500?kg with an Atlas 521 and 12-year journey.[136] For more concepts see Proposed Uranus missions.\\r\\nIn astrology, the planet Uranus () is the ruling planet of Aquarius.

It was followed by the introduction of penicillin in 1943.[3]\\r\\nMany well-known historical figures, including Scott Joplin, Franz Schubert, Al Capone, and douard Manet are believed to have had the disease.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSyphilis is the first \\"new\\" disease to be discovered after the invention of printing. News of it spread quickly and widely, and documentation is abundant. For the time, it was \\"front page news\\" that was widely known among the literate. It is also the first disease to be widely recognized as sexually transmitted, and it was taken as indicative of the moral state (sexual behavior) of the peoples in which it was found. Its geographic origin and moral significance were debated as had never been the case with any other illness. European countries blamed it on each other. Somewhat later, when the significance of the Western Hemisphere was perceived, it has been used in both pro- and anti-colonial discourse. If it existed in the Western Hemisphere and was brought to Europe by European explorers, it demonstrated the moral inferiority of the Native Americans, and their need for European civilization and Christianity. If it was brought to the Americas by Europeans, a position no longer defended by researchers, it was the great symbol of destructive imperialism.\\r\\nThe origin of syphilis is unknown.[1] Two primary theories have been proposed, with variations on each. There is strong evidence that syphilis was present among the indigenous peoples of the Americas before Europeans traveled to and from the New World.[2] However, whether strains of syphilis were present in the entire world for millennia, or if the disease was confined to the Americas in the pre-Columbian era, has been and continues to be debated.[2]\\r\\nThis theory holds that syphilis was a New World disease brought back by Columbus, Martn Alonso Pinz܇n, and/or other members of their crews as an unintentional part of the Columbian Exchange. Columbus's first voyages to the Americas occurred three years before the Naples syphilis outbreak of 1495.[2] 538 skeletal remains in the Dominican Republic have shown evidence characteristic of treponemal disease in 6-14% of the afflicted population, which Rothschild and colleagues have postulated was syphilis.[4] A more recent, modified version of the Columbian theory that better fit skeletal evidence from the New World, and also \\"absolved the New World of being the birthplace of syphilis\\", proposes that a nonvenereal form of treponemal disease, without the lesions common to congenital syphilis, was brought back to Europe by Columbus and his crew. Upon arrival in the Old World, the bacterium, which was similar to modern day yaws, responded to new selective pressures with the eventual birth of the subspecies of sexually transmitted syphilis.[5][6] This theory is supported by genetic studies of venereal syphilis and related bacteria, which found a disease intermediate between yaws and syphilis in Guyana, South America.[7][8] However, the study has been criticized in part because some of its conclusions were based on a tiny number of sequence differences between the Guyana strains and other treponemes whose sequences were examined.[5][9] The 2011 Yearbook of Physical Anthropology published an appraisal by Harper and colleagues, of previous studies and stated that the \\"skeletal data bolsters the case that syphilis did not exist in Europe before Columbus set sail.\\"[10] The scientific evidence as determined by a systematic review of 54 previously published, peer-reviewed instances lends support to the theory that syphilis was unknown in Europe until Columbus returned from the Americas. According to this appraisal, \\"Skeletal evidence that reputedly showed signs of syphilis in Europe and other parts of the Old World before Christopher Columbus made his voyage in 1492 does not hold up when subjected to standardized analyses for diagnosis and dating, according to an appraisal in the current Yearbook of Physical Anthropology. This is the first time that all 54 previously published cases have been evaluated systematically, and bolsters the case that syphilis came from the New World.\\"[11] In an article criticizing the presentation of new research findings in PBS and BBC documentaries about syphilis, researchers said they showed \\"a blatant disregard for the peer review process in making the case for pre-Columbian syphilis in the Old World. [...] As in all scientific fields, in order to resolve the controversy over the origin and antiquity of syphilis in the Old World, there is a strong need for adherence to standard practice in scientific publication and the increased publication of relevant evidence in peer-reviewed journals.\\"[5]\\r\\nThe Aztec god Nanahuatzin is often interpreted as suffering from syphilis.[12]\\r\\nThe theory holds that syphilis was present in Europe before the arrival of Europeans in the Americas. Some scholars during the 18th and 19th centuries believed that the symptoms of syphilis in its tertiary form were described by Hippocrates in Classical Greece.[13] Skeletons in pre-Columbus Pompeii and Metaponto in Italy with damage similar to that caused by congenital syphilis have also been found.[14][15][16] However, these claims have not been submitted for peer review, and the evidence that has been made available to other scientists is weak.[5] Nevertheless, Douglas W. Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, and other supporters of this idea, say that many medieval European cases of leprosy, colloquially called lepra, were actually cases of syphilis. Although folklore claimed that syphilis was unknown in Europe until the return of the diseased sailors of the Columbian voyages, Owsley says that \\"syphilis probably cannot be 'blamed'as it often ison any geographical area or specific race. The evidence suggests that the disease existed in both hemispheres from prehistoric times. It is only coincidental with the Columbus expeditions that the syphilis previously thought of as 'lepra' flared into virulence at the end of the 15th?century.\\"[17] Lobdell and Owsley wrote that a European writer who recorded an outbreak of \\"lepra\\" in 1303 was \\"clearly describing syphilis.\\"[17] In 2015, researchers discovered 14th-century skeletons in Austria that they say show signs of congenital syphilis, which is transmitted from mother to child rather than sexually, which could refute the Columbian Theory,[18] adding \\"another wrinkle to a debate that doesnt seem likely to be resolved any time soon.\\"[6][19]\\r\\nHistorian Alfred Crosby suggested in 2003 that both theories are partly correct in a \\"combination theory\\". Crosby says that the bacterium that causes syphilis belongs to the same phylogenetic family as the bacteria that cause yaws and several other diseases. Despite the tradition of assigning the homeland of yaws to sub-Saharan Africa, Crosby notes that there is no unequivocal evidence of any related disease having been present in pre-Columbian Europe, Africa, or Asia. Crosby writes, \\"It is not impossible that the organisms causing treponematosis arrived from America in the 1490s ... and evolved into both venereal and non-venereal syphilis and yaws.\\"[20] However, Crosby considers it more likely that a highly contagious ancestral species of the bacteria moved with early human ancestors across the land bridge of the Bering Straits many thousands of years ago without dying out in the original source population. He hypothesizes that \\"the differing ecological conditions produced different types of treponematosis and, in time, closely related but different diseases.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe historical origin of syphilis has modern social effects.[21] The arrival of Europeans in the New World resulted in the damaging effects of colonialism and the spread of deadly diseases like smallpox that European explorers unintentionally brought to the Americas. According to biologist Marlene Zuk, \\"The origin of syphilis has always held an implied accusation: if Europeans brought it to the New World, the disease is one more symbol of Western imperialism run amok, one more grudge to hold against colonialism.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe first well-recorded European outbreak of what is now known as syphilis occurred in 1495 among French troops besieging Naples, Italy.[2] It may have been transmitted to the French via Spanish mercenaries serving King Charles of France in that siege.[17] From this centre, the disease swept across Europe. As Jared Diamond describes it, \\"[W]hen syphilis was first definitely recorded in Europe in 1495, its pustules often covered the body from the head to the knees, caused flesh to fall from people's faces, and led to death within a few months.\\" The disease then was much more lethal than it is today.[22] The epidemiology of this first syphilis epidemic shows that the disease was either new or a mutated form of an earlier disease.\\r\\nSome researchers argue that syphilis was carried from the New World to Europe after Columbus' voyages, while others argue the disease has a much longer history in Europe. Many of the crew members who served on this voyage later joined the army of King Charles VIII in his invasion of Italy in 1495, which some argue may have resulted in the spreading of the disease across Europe and as many as five million deaths.[8] Some findings suggested Europeans could have carried the nonvenereal tropical bacteria home, where the organisms may have mutated into a more deadly form in the different conditions and low immunity of the population of Europe.[23] Syphilis was a major killer in Europe during the Renaissance.[24] In his Serpentine Malady (Seville, 1539) Ruy Daz de Isla estimated that over a million people were infected in Europe. He also stated clearly that the disease was previously unknown, and came from the island of Hispaniola (modern Dominican Republic and Haiti).[25][dead link]\\r\\nThe name \\"syphilis\\" was coined by the Italian physician and poet Girolamo Fracastoro in his pastoral noted poem, written in Latin, titled Syphilis sive morbus gallicus (Latin for \\"Syphilis or The French Disease\\") in 1530.[3][26] The protagonist of the poem is a shepherd named Syphilus (perhaps a variant spelling of Sipylus, a character in Ovid's Metamorphoses). Syphilus is presented as the first man to contract the disease, sent by the god Apollo as punishment for the defiance that Syphilus and his followers had shown him.[3] From this character Fracastoro derived a new name for the disease, which he also used in his medical text De Contagionibus (\\"On Contagious Diseases\\").[27]\\r\\nUntil that time, as Fracastoro notes, syphilis had been called the \\"French disease\\" (Italian: mal francese) in Italy, Malta,[28] Poland and Germany, and the \\"Italian disease\\" in France. In addition, the Dutch called it the \\"Spanish disease\\", the Russians called it the \\"Polish disease\\", and the Turks called it the \\"Christian disease\\" or \\"Frank (Western European) disease\\" (frengi). These \\"national\\" names were generally reflective of contemporary political spite between nations and frequently served as a sort of propaganda; the Protestant Dutch, for example, fought and eventually won a war of independence against their Spanish Habsburg rulers who were Catholic, so referring to Syphilis as the \\"Spanish\\" disease reinforced a politically useful perception that the Spanish were immoral or unworthy. However, the attributions are also suggestive of possible routes of the spread of the infection, at least as perceived by \\"recipient\\" populations. The inherent xenophobia of the terms also stemmed from the disease's particular epidemiology, often being spread by foreign sailors and soldiers during their frequent sexual contact with local prostitutes.[29]\\r\\nDuring the 16th?century, it was called \\"great pox\\" in order to distinguish it from smallpox. In its early stages, the great pox produced a rash similar to smallpox (also known as variola).[citation needed] However, the name is misleading, as smallpox was a far more deadly disease. The terms \\"lues\\"[30] (or Lues venerea, Latin for \\"venereal plague\\") and \\"Cupid's disease\\"[31] have also been used to refer to syphilis. In Scotland, syphilis was referred to as the Grandgore. The ulcers suffered by British soldiers in Portugal were termed \\"The Black Lion\\".[32]\\r\\nThere were originally no effective treatments for syphilis, although a number of remedies were tried. In the infant stages of this disease in Europe, many ineffective and dangerous treatments were used. The aim of treatment was to expel the foreign, disease-causing substance out of the body, so methods included blood-letting, laxative use, and baths in wine and herbs or olive oil.[33]\\r\\nMercury was a common, long-standing treatment for syphilis, and its use as such has been suggested to date back to The Canon of Medicine (1025) by the Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna);[34] although this is only possible if syphilis existed in the Old World prior to Columbus (see ?Origin). One of the first supporters of mercury treatment was Paracelsus because it had positive effects on the Arabic treatment of leprosy, which was thought to be a disease related to syphilis.[35] Giorgio Sommariva of Verona is recorded to have used mercury to treat syphilis in 1496, and is often recognized as the first physician to have done so, although he may not have been a physician.[36] During the sixteenth century, mercury was administered to syphilitic patients in various ways, including by rubbing it on the skin, by applying a plaster, and by mouth.[37] A \\"Fumigation\\" method of administering mercury was also used, in which mercury was vaporized over a fire and the patients were exposed to the resulting steam, either by being placed in a bottomless seat over the hot coals, or by having their entire bodies except for the head enclosed in a box (called a \\"tabernacle\\") that received the steam.[37] The goal of mercury treatment was to cause the patient to salivate, which was thought to expel the disease. Unpleasant side effects of mercury treatment included gum ulcers and loose teeth.[37] Mercury continued to be used in syphilis treatment for centuries; an 1869 article by TJ Walker discussed administering mercury by injection for this purpose.[38]\\r\\nGuaiacum was a popular treatment in the sixteenth century and was strongly advocated by Ulrich Von Hutten and others.[37] Because guaiacum came from Hispaniola where Columbus had landed, proponents of the Columbian theory contended that God had provided a cure in the same location from which the disease originated.[37] In 1525, the Spanish priest Francisco Delicado, who himself suffered from syphilis, wrote El modo de adoperare el legno de India discussing the use of guaiacum for treatment of syphilis.[39] Although guaiacum did not have the unpleasant side effects of mercury, guaiacum was not particularly effective,[37] at least not beyond the short term,[39] and mercury was thought to be more effective.[37] Some physicians continued to use both mercury and guaiacum on patients. After 1522, the Blatterhaus  an Augsburg municipal hospital for the syphilitic poor[40]  would administer guaiacum (as a hot drink, followed by a sweating cure) as the first treatment, and use mercury as the treatment of last resort.[37]\\r\\nAnother sixteenth-century treatment advocated by the Italian physician Antonio Musa Brassavola was the oral administration of Root of China,[37] a form of sarsaparilla (Smilax).[41] In the seventeenth century, English physician and herbalist Nicholas Culpeper recommended the use of heartsease (wild pansy).[42]\\r\\nBefore effective treatments were available, syphilis could sometimes be disfiguring in the long term, leading to defects of the face and nose (\\"nasal collapse\\"). Syphilis was a stigmatized disease due to its sexually transmissible nature. Such defects marked the person as a social pariah, and a symbol of sexual deviancy. Artificial noses were sometimes used to improve this appearance. The pioneering work of the facial surgeon Gasparo Tagliacozzi in the 16th century marked one of the earliest attempts to surgically reconstruct nose defects. Before the invention of the free flap, only local tissue adjacent to the defect could be harvested for use, as the blood supply was a vital determining factor in the survival of the flap. Tagliacozzi's technique was to harvest tissue from the arm without removing its pedicle from the blood supply on the arm. The patient would have to stay with their arm strapped to their face until new blood vessels grew at the recipient site, and the flap could finally be separated from the arm during a second procedure.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs the disease became better understood, more effective treatments were found. An antimicrobial used for treating disease was the organo-arsenical drug Salvarsan, developed in 1908 by Sahachiro Hata in the laboratory of Nobel prize winner Paul Ehrlich. This group later discovered the related arsenic, Neosalvarsan, which is less toxic.[43]\\r\\nIt was observed that sometimes patients who developed high fevers were cured of syphilis[by whom?]. Thus, for a brief time malaria was used as treatment for tertiary syphilis because it produced prolonged and high fevers (a form of pyrotherapy). This was considered an acceptable risk because the malaria could later be treated with quinine, which was available at that time. Malaria as a treatment for syphilis was usually reserved for late disease, especially neurosyphilis, and then followed by either Salvarsan or Neosalvarsan as adjuvant therapy. This discovery was championed by Julius Wagner-Jauregg,[44] who won the 1927 Nobel Prize for Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation in the treatment of neurosyphilis. Later, hyperthermal cabinets (sweat-boxes) were used for the same purpose.[45] These treatments were finally rendered obsolete by the discovery of penicillin, and its widespread manufacture after World War II allowed syphilis to be effectively and reliably cured.[46]\\r\\nIn 1905, Schaudinn and Hoffmann discovered Treponema pallidum in tissue of patients with syphilis.[3] One year later, the first effective test for syphilis, the Wassermann test, was developed. Although it had some false positive results, it was a major advance in the detection and prevention of syphilis.[citation needed] By allowing testing before the acute symptoms of the disease had developed, this test allowed the prevention of transmission of syphilis to others, even though it did not provide a cure for those infected. In the 1930s the Hinton test, developed by William Augustus Hinton, and based on flocculation, was shown to have fewer false positive reactions than the Wassermann test.[47] Both of these early tests have been superseded by newer analytical methods.\\r\\nWhile working at the Rockefeller University (then called the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research) in 1913, Hideyo Noguchi, a Japanese scientist, demonstrated the presence of the spirochete Treponema pallidum in the brain of a progressive paralysis patient, associating Treponema pallidum with neurosyphilis.[48] Prior to Noguchi's discovery, syphilis had been a burden to humanity in many lands. Without its cause being understood, it was sometimes misdiagnosed and often misattributed to damage by political enemies. It is called \\"the great pretender\\" for its variety of symptoms. Felix Milgrom developed a test for syphilis. The Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize was named to honor the man who identified the agent in association with the late form of the infectious disease.[49]\\r\\nThe earliest known depiction of an individual with syphilis is Albrecht Drer's Syphilitic Man, a woodcut believed to represent a Landsknecht, a Northern European mercenary.[51] The myth of the femme fatale or \\"poison women\\" of the 19th century is believed to be partly derived from the devastation of syphilis, with classic examples in literature including John Keats' La Belle Dame sans Merci.[52][53] Poet Sebastian Brandt in 1496 wrote a poem titled De pestilentiali Scorra sive mala de Franzos which explains the spread of the disease across the European continent.[54] Brandt also created artistic creations showing religious and political views of syphilis, especially with a work showing Saint Mary and Jesus throwing lightning to punish or cure those afflicted by syphilis, and he also added King Maximilian I in the work, being rewarded by Mary and Jesus for his work against the immoral disease, to show the strong relationship between church and state during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.[55]\\r\\nThe artist Jan van der Straet painted a scene of a wealthy man receiving treatment for syphilis with the tropical wood guaiacum sometime around 1580.[56] The title of the work is \\"Preparation and Use of Guayaco for Treating Syphilis\\". That the artist chose to include this image in a series of works celebrating the New World indicates how important a treatment, however ineffective, for syphilis was to the European elite at that time. The richly colored and detailed work depicts four servants preparing the concoction while a physician looks on, hiding something behind his back while the hapless patient drinks.[57] Another artistic depiction of syphilis treatment is credited to Jacques Laniet in the seventeenth century as he illustrated a man using the fumigation stove, another popular method of syphilis treatment, with a nearby barrel etched with the saying \\"For a pleasure, a thousand pains.\\"[55] Remedies to cure syphilis were frequently illustrated to deter those from acts which could lead to the contraction of syphilis because the treatment methods were normally painful and ineffective.\\r\\nOne of the most infamous United States cases of questionable medical ethics in the 20th?century was the Tuskegee syphilis study.[58] The study took place in Tuskegee, Alabama, and was supported by the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) in partnership with the Tuskegee Institute.[59] The study began in 1932, when syphilis was a widespread problem and there was no safe and effective treatment.[60] The study was designed to measure the progression of untreated syphilis. By 1947, penicillin had been shown to be an effective cure for early syphilis and was becoming widely used to treat the disease.[59] Its use in later syphilis, however, was still unclear.[60] Study directors continued the study and did not offer the participants treatment with penicillin.[59] This is debated, and some have found that penicillin was given to many of the subjects.[60]\\r\\nIn the 1960s, Peter Buxtun sent a letter to the CDC, who controlled the study, expressing concern about the ethics of letting hundreds of black men die of a disease that could be cured. The CDC asserted that it needed to continue the study until all of the men had died. In 1972, Buxton went to the mainstream press, causing a public outcry. As a result, the program was terminated, a lawsuit brought those affected nine million dollars, and Congress created a commission empowered to write regulations to deter such abuses from occurring in the future.[59]\\r\\nOn 16 May 1997, thanks to the efforts of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee formed in 1994, survivors of the study were invited to the White House to be present when President Bill Clinton apologized on behalf of the United States government for the study.[61]\\r\\nSyphilis experiments were also carried out in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948. They were United States-sponsored human experiments, conducted during the government of Juan Jos Arvalo with the cooperation of some Guatemalan health ministries and officials. Doctors infected soldiers, prisoners, and mental patients with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, without the informed consent of the subjects, and then treated them with antibiotics. In October 2010, the U.S. formally apologized to Guatemala for conducting these experiments.[62]\\r\\nIn 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother to child transmission of syphilis.[63]","input":"When was penicillin discovered as a cure for syphilis?"},{"output":"March 19, 1918","context":"The history of standard time in the United States began November 18, 1883, when United States and Canadian railroads instituted standard time in time zones. Before then, time of day was a local matter, and most cities and towns used some form of local solar time, maintained by some well-known clock (for example, on a church steeple or in a jeweler's window). The new standard time system was not immediately embraced by all.\\r\\nUse of standard time gradually increased because of its obvious practical advantages for communication and travel. Standard time in time zones was not established in U.S. law until the Standard Time Act of 1918 of March 19, 1918, also known as the Calder Act (15 USC 260).[1][2] The act also established daylight saving time, itself a contentious idea.\\r\\nDaylight saving time was repealed in 1919, but standard time in time zones remained in law, with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) having the authority over time zone boundaries. Daylight time became a local matter. It was re-established nationally early in World War II, and was continuously observed until the end of the war.\\r\\nAfter the war its use varied among states and localities. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 provided standardization in the dates of beginning and end of daylight time in the U.S. but allowed for local exemptions from its observance. The act also continued the authority of the ICC over time zone boundaries. In subsequent years, the United States Congress transferred the authority over time zones to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), modified (several times) the beginning date of daylight time, and renamed the three westernmost time zones.\\r\\nTime zone boundaries have changed greatly since their original introduction and changes still occasionally occur. DOT issues press releases when these changes are made. Generally, time zone boundaries have tended to shift westward. Places on the eastern edge of a time zone can effectively move sunset an hour later (by the clock) by shifting to the time zone immediately to their east.\\r\\nIf they do so, the boundary of that zone is locally shifted to the west; the accumulation of such changes results in the long-term westward trend. The process is not inexorable, however, since the late sunrises experienced by such places during the winter may be regarded as too undesirable. Furthermore, under the law, the principal standard for deciding on a time zone change is the \\"convenience of commerce\\". Proposed time zone changes have been both approved and rejected based on this criterion, although most such proposals have been accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDaylight saving time was established by the Standard Time Act of 1918. The Act was intended to save electricity for seven months of the year, during World War I.[3] DST was repealed in 1919 over a Presidential veto,[4] but standard time in time zones remained in law, with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) having the authority over time zone boundaries. Daylight time became a local matter.\\r\\nDuring World War II, Congress enacted the War Time Act (56 Stat. 9) on January 20, 1942. Year-round DST was reinstated in the United States on February 9, 1942, again as a wartime measure to conserve energy resources.[5] This remained in effect until after the end of the war. The Amendment to the War Time Act (59 Stat. 537), enacted September 25, 1945, ended DST as of September 30, 1945. During this period, the official designation War Time was used for year-round DST. For example, Eastern War Time (EWT) would be the equivalent of Eastern Daylight Time during this period.\\r\\nFrom 1945 to 1966 U.S. federal law did not address DST. States and cities were free to observe DST or not, and most places that did observe DST did so from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in September. In the mid-1950s many areas in the northeastern United States began extending DST to the last Sunday in October. The lack of standardization led to a patchwork where some areas observed DST while adjacent areas did not, and it was not unheard of to have to reset a clock several times during a short trip (e.g., bus drivers operating on West Virginia Route 2 between Moundsville, West Virginia, and Steubenville, Ohio had to reset their watches seven times over 35 miles).[6]\\r\\nIn summer 1960 AprilÿOctober Daylight Time was nearly universal in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and states east and north of there. In Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky and Virginia and states north and east of there, some areas had it and some did not. Except for California and Nevada, which had April-Sept Daylight Time, 99% of the rest of the country used Standard Time year-round. (The Official Guide says \\"State law prohibits the observance of \\"Daylight Saving\\" time in Kentucky but Anchorage, Louisville and Shelbyville will advance their clocks one hour from Central Standard time for the period April 24 to October 29, inclusive.\\")\\r\\nIn the middle 1960s the airline and other transportation industries lobbied for uniformity of Daylight dates in the United States.\\r\\nThe U.S. federal Uniform Time Act became law on April 13, 1966 and it mandated that DST begin nationwide on the last Sunday in April and end on the last Sunday in October, effective in 1967. The act explicitly preempted all previously enacted state laws related to the beginning and ending of DST. Any state that wanted to be exempt from DST could do so by passing a state law, provided that it exempted the entire state, and Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Indiana, and Michigan chose to do so. However, Alaska, Indiana, and Michigan subsequently chose to observe DST. The law was amended in 1972 to permit states that straddle a time zone boundary to exempt the entire area of the state lying in one time zone. Indiana chose to exempt the portion of the state lying in the Eastern Time Zone; however, that exemption was eliminated in 2006 and the entire state of Indiana now observes DST, leaving Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation) and Hawaii as the only two states not to observe DST. On July 8, 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1986 into law that contained a daylight saving rider authored by Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA).[3] The starting date of DST was amended to the first Sunday in April effective in 1987. DST continued to end on the last Sunday in October. While the states retain the capability to exempt themselves from DST, they are forbidden by the 1966 federal law (15 USC 260a(b))[7] from increasing a state's time spent on DST, unless the United States Congress does this for the entire nation.\\r\\nIn response to the 1973 energy crisis, DST in the United States began earlier in both 1974 and 1975, commencing on the first Sunday in January (January 6) in the former year and the last Sunday in February (February 23) in the latter. The extension of daylight saving time was not continued due to public opposition to late sunrise times during the winter months. In 1976, the United States reverted to the schedule set in the Uniform Time Act.\\r\\nStarting March 11, 2007, DST was extended another four to five weeks, from the second Sunday of March to the first Sunday of November. The change was introduced by Representatives Fred Upton (R-MI) and Edward Markey (D-MA) and added to the Energy Policy Act of 2005; the House had originally approved a motion that would have extended DST even farther from the first Sunday in March to the last Sunday in November, but Senators Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and Pete Domenici (R-NM) agreed to scale back the proposal in conference committee due to complaints from farmers and the airline industry. Proponents claimed that the extension would save \\"the equivalent of\\" 10,000 barrels (1,600?m3) of oil per day, but this figure was based on U.S. Department of Energy information from the 1970s, the accuracy and relevance of which the DoE no longer stands by. Later studies by the U.S. Department of Energy and the California Energy Commission have predicted much smaller energy benefits.[8] There is very little recent research on what the actual positive effects, if any, might be.\\r\\nSince DST moves sunrise one hour later by the clock, late sunrise times become a problem when DST is observed either too far before the vernal equinox or too far after the autumnal equinox. Because of this, the extension was greeted with criticism by those concerned for the safety of children who would have been forced to travel to school before sunrise, especially in the month of March. In addition, the airline industry was especially concerned if DST were to be extended through to the last Sunday in November, as this is very often (6 out of every 7 years) the Sunday after Thanksgiving. This is one of the busiest travel days at American airports, and could have resulted in much havoc among travelers who forgot that the clocks were changing that day.\\r\\nIf the original proposal to extend DST through the last Sunday in November had been adopted, the entire United States, with the exception of the states that exempted themselves, would have experienced the latest sunrises of the year during the month of November, which would have approached the extremely late sunrise times when DST went into effect on January 6, 1974 due to the 1973 energy crisis creeping after 9 am in places like New Salem, North Dakota at the northwestern edges of time zones.","input":"When did daylight savings time become a thing?"},{"output":"Ilustrados","context":"The Ilustrados (Spanish for \\"erudite,\\"[1] \\"learned,\\"[2] or \\"enlightened ones\\"[3]) constituted the Filipino educated class during the Spanish colonial period in the late 19th century.[4][5]\\r\\nThey were the middle class who were educated in Spanish and exposed to Spanish liberal and European nationalist ideals.

Traditionally, a Latter Day Saint holding this priesthood office is a \\"traveling minister\\"[1] and an \\"especial witness\\"[2] of Jesus Christ, charged with the mission of preaching the gospel to the entire world under the direction of the Twelve Apostles.[3] Latter Day Saints teach that the office of seventy was anciently conferred upon the seventy disciples mentioned in the Gospel of Luke  10:1-2. Multiple individuals holding the office of seventy are referred to collectively as \\"seventies\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn practical terms, the priesthood office of seventy is one which has varied widely over the course of history. As originally envisioned by Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith in the 1830s, the seventy were to be a body composed of several separate quorums of up to 70 seventies each, all of which would be led by seven presidents. These presidents, chosen from the first quorum, would appoint and direct the other quorums of seventy.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the LDS Church, the largest of the Latter Day Saint denominations, the quorums of the seventy are directed and supervised hierarchically by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who are in turn directed by the First Presidency. As introduced by Smith, the apostles and the seventy had authority only outside the main body of Latter Day Saints in Zion, and in the outlying stakes. Members in Zion and the stakes were led by the High Council of Zion (under the direction of the First Presidency) and stake high councils.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a body, the seventy in the LDS Church are considered to be equal in priesthood authority with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.[5][6] This presumably means that if the apostles were killed or incapacitated, the seventy could take over the function of the apostles. However, in such circumstances, the seventy would be required to act unanimously.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, the First Quorum of the Seventy came into being in 1835 when seven men were set apart as the First Seven Presidents of the Seventy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1837, six of the seven presidents were released because it was discovered that they had previously been ordained high priests. Five of these men were ultimately replaced by others. The other twoLevi W. Hancock and Joseph Youngremained members of the First Seven Presidents for the rest of their lives.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2005, the Quorums of the Seventy in the LDS Church have been organized into eight quorums with a presidency of seven. The seventy act as emissaries of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and First Presidency of the church in organizing, training, proselytizing, and administering to millions of people scattered all across the globe. The seventy are the layer between local church administration and general church administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the First and the Second Quorums of the Seventy are general authorities of the church with responsibilities covering the church as a whole.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the Third through Eighth Quorums of the Seventy are called an area seventy and are ordained to the priesthood office of seventy, but they are not general authorities of the church. Area seventies generally have authority only within a geographical unit of the church called an area.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the Community of Christ, a seventy is also considered to be an elder but is not a High Priest. Part of the function of the seventy is a missionary role and he or she works closely with the apostle in charge of his or her mission field. Seventies are organized into ten quorums, each quorum being presided over by a president. These presidents make up the Council of Presidents of Seventy, and are collectively led by the Senior President of the Presidents of Seventy.  All ten quorums are equal with one another.  When someone is ordained a seventy, that person automatically becomes a member of one of the Ten Quorums, and remains a member of one of the Quorums (although the specific quorum may change based on residency) so long as that person remains a seventy. In other words, it is not possible to be a seventy and not belong to one of these quorums.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current roster of Presidents of Seventy include:\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, there have always been 7 quorums, with a maximum of 70 members each.  However, on January 17, 2010, PresidentÿProphet Stephen M. Veazey announced that the number of quorums (and presidents) could be flexible, based on the current needs of the church.[9] The change from seven to ten quorums occurred after the acceptance of Doctrine and Covenants Section 164 at the World Conference in April 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seventy in this church are called the Seventy Evangelists and strictly limited to that number. They are ordained evangelists, not seventies. Missionary work is the focus of this calling in The Church of Jesus Christ.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is currently one functioning Quorum of Seventy in the Apostolic United Brethren.

He is the patron saint of adopted children.\\r\\n\\r\\nPractically all that is known of William comes from the Nova Legenda Anglie, and that is little. He was born in Perth, at that time one of the principal towns of Scotland. In youth, he had been somewhat wild, but on reaching manhood he devoted himself wholly to the service of God. A baker by trade (some sources say he was a fisherman), he was accustomed to setting aside every tenth loaf for the poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to Mass daily, and one morning, before it was light, found on the threshold of the church an abandoned child, whom he adopted and to whom he taught his trade. Later he took a vow to visit the Holy Places, and, having received the consecrated wallet and staff as a Palmer, set out with his adopted son, whose name is given as \\"Cockermay Doucri\\", which is said to be Scots for \\"David the Foundling\\". They stayed three days at Rochester, and purposed to proceed next day to Canterbury (and perhaps thence to Jerusalem), but instead David wilfully misled his benefactor on a short-cut and, with robbery in view, felled him with a blow on the head and cut his throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe body was discovered by a mad woman, who plaited a garland of honeysuckle and placed it first on the head of the corpse and then her own, whereupon the madness left her. On learning her tale the monks of Rochester carried the body to the cathedral and there buried it. He was honored as a martyr because he was on a pilgrimage to holy places. As a result of the miracle involving the madwoman as well as other miracles wrought at his intercession after death, he was acclaimed a saint by the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1256 Lawrence of St Martin, Bishop of Rochester, obtained the canonisation of William from Pope Alexander IV. A beginning was at once made with his shrine, which was situated first in the crypt, then in the northeast transept, and attracted crowds of pilgrims. At the same time a small chapel was built at the place of the murder, which was thereafter called Palmersdene. Remains of this chapel are still to be seen near the present St William's Hospital, on the road leading by Horsted Farm to Maidstone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shrine of St William of Perth became a place of pilgrimage second only to Canterbury's shrine of Saint Thomas Becket, bringing many thousands of medieval pilgrims to the cathedral.[2] Their footsteps wore down the original stone Pilgrim Steps, and nowadays they are covered with wooden steps.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 and 19 February 1300, King Edward I gave two donations of seven shillings to the shrine.  Offerings at the shrine were also recorded for Queen Philippa (1352).  On 29 November 1399, Pope Boniface IX granted an indulgence to those who visited and gave alms to the shrine on certain specified days.  The local people continued to make bequests through the 15th and 16th centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coat of arms of the Bishop of Rochester consists of Saint Andrew's cross with a scallop shell in its centre, which is said to represent William; Andrew being the patron saint of Scotland and scallops being the symbol of pilgrimage. St. William is represented in a wall-painting, which was discovered in 1883 in Frindsbury church, near Rochester, which is supposed to have been painted about 1256ÿ1266.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis official feast day is 23 May, though there is another feast day celebrated on 22 April. He is the patron saint of adopted children. In the film St. Vincent, St William is featured in a school report by one of the main characters, Oliver, who finds him interesting primarily because he himself is adopted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSt William of Perth Primary School, Rochester, is named after him.\\r\\n\\r\\nand|Catholicismlol\\r\\n\\r\\n?This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:?Herbermann, Charles, ed.

Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.[1]\\r\\nMost sources define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal.[2][3] Some other sources exclude the anal canal.[4][5][6]\\r\\nIn humans, the large intestine begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just at or below the waist, where it is joined to the end of the small intestine at the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. It then continues as the colon ascending the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon, and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the anal canal.[7] Overall, in humans, the large intestine is about 1.5 metres (5?ft) long, which is about one-fifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colon is the last part of the digestive system. It extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the site in which flora-aided (largely bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material occurs. Unlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients. About 1.5 litres or 45 ounces of water arrives in the colon each day.[9]\\r\\nThe length of the adult human male colon is 166?cm (range of 80 to 313?cm), on average, for females it is 155?cm (range of 80 to 214?cm).[10] The average inner diameter of sections of the colon in centimeters (with ranges in parentheses) are cecum 8.7 (8.0-10.5), ascending colon 6.6 (6.0-7.0), transverse colon 5.8 (5.0-6.5), descending/sigmoid colon 6.3 (6.0-6.8) and rectum near rectal/sigmoid junction 5.7 (4.5-7.5).[11]\\r\\nIn mammals, the colon consists of five sections: the cecum plus the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon and the rectum.[1]\\r\\nSections of the colon are:\\r\\nThe parts of the colon are either intraperitoneal or behind it in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal organs in general do not have a complete covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. Intraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile.[12] Of the colon, the ascending colon, descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal.[13] This is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.\\r\\nThe cecum is the first section of the colon and involved in the digestion, while the appendix which develops embryologically from it, is a structure of the colon, not involved in digestion and considered to be part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The function of the appendix is uncertain, but some sources believe that the appendix has a role in housing a sample of the colon's microflora, and is able to help to repopulate the colon with bacteria if the microflora has been damaged during the course of an immune reaction.\\r\\nThe ascending colon is the first of four sections of the large intestine. It is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the cecum. The ascending colon runs upwards through the abdominal cavity toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20?cm).\\r\\nOne of the main functions of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from waste material and recycle it. As the waste material exits the small intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum and then to the ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. The unwanted waste material is moved upwards toward the transverse colon by the action of peristalsis. The ascending colon is sometimes attached to the appendix via Gerlach's valve. The appendix, traditionally seen as a vestigial organ, has been shown to have a high concentration of lymphatic cells. In ruminants, the ascending colon is known as the spiral colon.[14][15][16] Taking into account all ages and sexes, colon cancer occurs here most often (41%).[17]\\r\\nThe transverse colon is the part of the colon from the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure (the turn of the colon by the spleen). The transverse colon hangs off the stomach, attached to it by a large fold of peritoneum called the greater omentum. On the posterior side, the transverse colon is connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the transverse mesocolon.\\r\\nThe transverse colon is encased in peritoneum, and is therefore mobile (unlike the parts of the colon immediately before and after it).\\r\\nThe proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is perfused by the middle colic artery, a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), while the latter third is supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The \\"watershed\\" area between these two blood supplies, which represents the embryologic division between the midgut and hindgut, is an area sensitive to ischemia.\\r\\nThe descending colon is the part of the colon from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. One function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store feces that will be emptied into the rectum. It is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. In the other third, it has a (usually short) mesentery.[18] The arterial supply comes via the left colic artery. The descending colon is also called the distal gut, as it is further along the gastrointestinal tract than the proximal gut. Gut flora are very dense in this region.\\r\\nThe sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and before the rectum. The name sigmoid means S-shaped (see sigmoid; cf. sigmoid sinus). The walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular, and contract to increase the pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum.\\r\\nThe sigmoid colon is supplied with blood from several branches (usually between 2 and 6) of the sigmoid arteries, a branch of the IMA. The IMA terminates as the superior rectal artery.\\r\\nSigmoidoscopy is a common diagnostic technique used to examine the sigmoid colon.\\r\\nThe rectum is the last section of the large intestine. It holds the formed feces awaiting elimination via defecation.\\r\\nThe cecum ÿ the first part of the large intestine\\r\\nThe taenia coli run the length of the large intestine. Because the taenia coli are shorter than the large bowel itself, the colon becomes sacculated, forming the haustra of the colon which are the shelf-like intraluminal projections.[19]\\r\\nArterial supply to the colon comes from branches of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). Flow between these two systems communicates via a \\"marginal artery\\" that runs parallel to the colon for its entire length. Historically, it has been believed that the arc of Riolan, or the meandering mesenteric artery (of Moskowitz), is a variable vessel connecting the proximal SMA to the proximal IMA that can be extremely important if either vessel is occluded. However, recent studies conducted with improved imaging technology have questioned the actual existence of this vessel, with some experts calling for the abolition of the terms from future medical literature.[citation needed]\\r\\nVenous drainage usually mirrors colonic arterial supply, with the inferior mesenteric vein draining into the splenic vein, and the superior mesenteric vein joining the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver.\\r\\nLymphatic drainage from the ascending colon and proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli.[20] The lymph from the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph nodes.[20] The lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain to the internal iliac nodes.[21] The anal canal below the pectinate line drains into the superficial inguinal nodes.[21] The pectinate line only roughly marks this transition.\\r\\nOne variation on the normal anatomy of the colon occurs when extra loops form, resulting in a colon that is up to five metres longer than normal. This condition, referred to as redundant colon, typically has no direct major health consequences, though rarely volvulus occurs, resulting in obstruction and requiring immediate medical attention.[22][23] A significant indirect health consequence is that use of a standard adult colonoscope is difficult and in some cases impossible when a redundant colon is present, though specialized variants on the instrument (including the pediatric variant) are useful in overcoming this problem.[24]\\r\\nThe wall of the large intestine is lined with simple columnar epithelium with invaginations. The invaginations are called the intestinal glands or colonic crypts.\\r\\nThe colon crypts are shaped like microscopic thick walled test tubes with a central hole down the length of the tube (the crypt lumen). Four tissue sections are shown here, two cut across the long axes of the crypts and two cut parallel to the long axes. In these images the cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry to show a brown-orange color if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CCOI). The nuclei of the cells (located at the outer edges of the cells lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray with haematoxylin. As seen in panels C and D, crypts are about 75 to about 110 cells long. Baker et al.[26] found that the average crypt circumference is 23 cells. Thus, by the images shown here, there are an average of about 1,725 to 2530 cells per colonic crypt. Nooteboom et al.[27] measuring the number of cells in a small number of crypts reported a range of 1500 to 4900 cells per colonic crypt. Cells are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along the crypt axis before being shed into the colonic lumen days later.[26] There are 5 to 6 stem cells at the bases of the crypts.[26]\\r\\nAs estimated from the image in panel A, there are about 100 colonic crypts per square millimeter of the colonic epithelium.[11] Since the average length of the human colon is 160.5?cm[10] and the average inner circumference of the colon is 6.2?cm.[11] the inner surface epithelial area of the human colon has an average area of about 995 sq cm, which includes 9,950,000 (close to 10 million) crypts.\\r\\nIn the four tissue sections shown here, many of the intestinal glands have cells with a mitochondrial DNA mutation in the CCOI gene and appear mostly white, with their main color being the blue-gray staining of the nuclei. As seen in panel B, a portion of the stem cells of three crypts appear to have a mutation in CCOI, so that 40% to 50% of the cells arising from those stem cells form a white segment in the cross cut area.\\r\\nOverall, the percent of crypts deficient for CCOI is less than 1% before age 40, but then increases linearly with age.[25] Colonic crypts deficient for CCOI in women reaches, on average, 18% in women and 23% in men by 80ÿ84 years of age.[25]\\r\\nCrypts of the colon can reproduce by fission, as seen in panel C, where a crypt is fissioning to form two crypts, and in panel B where at least one crypt appears to be fissioning. Most crypts deficient in CCOI are in clusters of crypts (clones of crypts) with two or more CCOI-deficient crypts adjacent to each other (see panel D).[25]\\r\\nAbout 150 of the many thousands of protein coding genes expressed in the large intestine, some are specific to the mucous membrane in different regions and include CEACAM7.[28]\\r\\nThe large intestine absorbs water and any remaining absorbable nutrients from the food before sending the indigestible matter to the rectum. The colon absorbs vitamins that are created by the colonic bacteria, such as vitamin K (especially important as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain adequate blood coagulation), vitamin B12, thiamine and riboflavin. It also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter in the rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation. The large intestine also secretes K+ and Cl-. Chloride secretion increases in cystic fibrosis. Recycling of various nutrients takes place in colon. Examples include fermentation of carbohydrates, short chain fatty acids, and urea cycling.[29][citation needed]\\r\\nThe appendix is attached to the inferior surface of the cecum, and contains a small amount of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which gives the appendix an undetermined role in immunity. However, the appendix is known to be important in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release biogenic amines and peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and development.[30] The appendix can be removed with no apparent damage or consequence to the patient.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy the time the chyme has reached this tube, most nutrients and 90% of the water have been absorbed by the body. At this point some electrolytes like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of ingested food (e.g., a large part of ingested amylose, starch which has been shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). As the chyme moves through the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. The ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. The muscles of the colon then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the descending colon.[31]\\r\\nThe bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own nourishment and create acetate, propionate, and butyrate as waste products, which in turn are used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment.[32] No protein is made available. In humans, perhaps 10% of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes available, though this may vary with diet;[33] in other animals, including other apes and primates, who have proportionally larger colons, more is made available, thus permitting a higher portion of plant material in the diet. The large intestine[34] produces no digestive enzymes  chemical digestion is completed in the small intestine before the chyme reaches the large intestine. The pH in the colon varies between 5.5 and 7 (slightly acidic to neutral).[35]\\r\\nWater absorption at the colon typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. This hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives water into the lateral intercellular spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid.[36] Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.\\r\\nThe large intestine houses over 700 species of bacteria that perform a variety of functions, as well as fungi, protozoa, and archaea. Species diversity varies by geography and diet.[37] The microbes in a human distal gut often number in the vicinity of 100 trillion, and can weigh around 200 grams (0.44 pounds). This mass of mostly symbiotic microbes has recently been called the latest human organ to be \\"discovered\\" or in other words, the \\"forgotten organ\\".[38]\\r\\nThe large intestine absorbs some of the products formed by the bacteria inhabiting this region. Undigested polysaccharides (fiber) are metabolized to short-chain fatty acids by bacteria in the large intestine and absorbed by passive diffusion. The bicarbonate that the large intestine secretes helps to neutralize the increased acidity resulting from the formation of these fatty acids.[39]\\r\\nThese bacteria also produce large amounts of vitamins, especially vitamin K and biotin (a B vitamin), for absorption into the blood. Although this source of vitamins, in general, provides only a small part of the daily requirement, it makes a significant contribution when dietary vitamin intake is low. An individual who depends on absorption of vitamins formed by bacteria in the large intestine may become vitamin-deficient if treated with antibiotics that inhibit the vitamin producing species of bacteria as well as the intended disease-causing bacteria.[40]\\r\\nOther bacterial products include gas (flatus), which is a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of the gases hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. Bacterial fermentation of undigested polysaccharides produces these. Some of the fecal odor is due to indoles, metabolized from the amino acid tryptophan. The normal flora is also essential in the development of certain tissues, including the cecum and lymphatics.[citation needed]\\r\\nThey are also involved in the production of cross-reactive antibodies. These are antibodies produced by the immune system against the normal flora, that are also effective against related pathogens, thereby preventing infection or invasion.\\r\\nThe two most prevalent phyla of the colon are firmicutes and bacteroides. The ratio between the two seems to vary widely as reported by the Human Microbiome Project.[41] Bacteroides are implicated in the initiation of colitis and colon cancer. Bifidobacteria are also abundant, and are often described as 'friendly bacteria'.[42][43]\\r\\nA mucus layer protects the large intestine from attacks from colonic commensal bacteria.[44]\\r\\nFollowing are the most common diseases or disorders of the colon:\\r\\nColonoscopy is the endoscopic examination of the large intestine and the distal part of the small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera on a flexible tube passed through the anus. It can provide a visual diagnosis (e.g. ulceration, polyps) and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of suspected colorectal cancer lesions. Colonoscopy can remove polyps as small as one millimetre or less. Once polyps are removed, they can be studied with the aid of a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not. It takes 15 years or less for a polyp to turn cancerous.\\r\\nColonoscopy is similar to sigmoidoscopythe difference being related to which parts of the colon each can examine. A colonoscopy allows an examination of the entire colon (1200ÿ1500?mm in length). A sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the distal portion (about 600?mm) of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions in the distal portion of the colon.[45][46][47]\\r\\nA sigmoidoscopy is often used as a screening procedure for a full colonoscopy, often done in conjunction with a fecal occult blood test (FOBT). About 5% of these screened patients are referred to colonoscopy.[48]\\r\\nVirtual colonoscopy, which uses 2D and 3D imagery reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) scans or from nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) scans, is also possible, as a totally non-invasive medical test, although it is not standard and still under investigation regarding its diagnostic abilities. Furthermore, virtual colonoscopy does not allow for therapeutic maneuvers such as polyp/tumour removal or biopsy nor visualization of lesions smaller than 5 millimeters. If a growth or polyp is detected using CT colonography, a standard colonoscopy would still need to be performed. Additionally, surgeons have lately been using the term pouchoscopy to refer to a colonoscopy of the ileo-anal pouch.\\r\\nThe large intestine is truly distinct only in tetrapods, in which it is almost always separated from the small intestine by an ileocaecal valve. In most vertebrates, however, it is a relatively short structure running directly to the anus, although noticeably wider than the small intestine. Although the caecum is present in most amniotes, only in mammals does the remainder of the large intestine develop into a true colon.[49]\\r\\nIn some small mammals, the colon is straight, as it is in other tetrapods, but, in the majority of mammalian species, it is divided into ascending and descending portions; a distinct transverse colon is typically present only in primates. However, the taeniae coli and accompanying haustra are not found in either carnivorans or ruminants. The rectum of mammals (other than monotremes) is derived from the cloaca of other vertebrates, and is, therefore, not truly homologous with the \\"rectum\\" found in these species.[49]\\r\\nIn fish, there is no true large intestine, but simply a short rectum connecting the end of the digestive part of the gut to the cloaca. In sharks, this includes a rectal gland that secretes salt to help the animal maintain osmotic balance with the seawater. The gland somewhat resembles a caecum in structure, but is not a homologous structure.[49]\\r\\nIntestines\\r\\nColon. Deep dissection.

The term endurance training generally refers to training the aerobic system as opposed to the anaerobic system. The need for endurance in sports is often predicated as the need of cardiovascular and simple muscular endurance, but the issue of endurance is far more complex. Endurance can be divided into two categories including: general endurance and specific endurance. It can be shown that endurance in sport is closely tied to the execution of skill and technique. A well conditioned athlete can be defined as, the athlete who executes his or her technique consistently and effectively with the least effort.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEndurance training is essential for a variety of endurance sports. A notable example is distance running events (800 meters upwards to marathon and ultra-marathon) with the required degree of endurance training increasing with race distance. Two other popular examples are cycling (particularly road cycling) and competitive swimming. These three endurance sports are combined in triathlon. Other sports for which extensive amounts of endurance training are required include rowing and cross country skiing. Athletes can also undergo endurance training when their sport may not necessarily be an endurance sport in the whole sense but may still demand some endurance. For instance aerobic endurance is necessary (to varying extents) in racket sports, football, rugby, martial arts, basketball and cricket. Endurance exercise tends to be popular with non-athletes for the purpose of increasing general fitness or burning more calories to increase weight loss potential.\\r\\nLong-term endurance training induces many physiological adaptations both centrally and peripherally mediated. Central cardiovascular adaptations include decreased heart rate, increased stroke volume of the heart,[2] increased blood plasma, without any major changes in red blood cell count, which reduces blood viscosity and increased cardiac output as well as total mitochondrial volume in the muscle fibers used in the training (i.e. the thigh muscles in runners will have more mitochondria than the thigh muscles of swimmers). Mitochondria increase in both number and size and there are similar increases in myoglobin and oxidative enzymes. Adaptations of the peripheral include capillarization, that is an increase in the surface area that both the venous and arterial capillaries supply. This also allows for increased heat dissipation during strenuous exercise. The muscles heighten their glycogen and fat storing capabilities in endurance athletes in order to increase the length in time in which they can perform work. Endurance training primarily work the slow twitch (type 1) fibers and develop such fibers in their efficiency and resistance to fatigue. Catabolism also improves increasing the athletes capacity to use fat and glycogen stores as an energy source. These metabolic processes are known as glycogenolysis, glycolysis and lipolysis. There is higher efficiency in oxygen transport and distribution. In recent years it has been recognized that oxidative enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) that enable mitochondria to break down nutrients to form ATP increase by 2.5 times in well trained endurance athletes[2] In addition to SDH, myoglobin increases by 75-80% in well trained endurance athletes.[2]\\r\\nThe potential for negative health effects from long-term, high-volume endurance training have begun to emerge in the scientific literature in recent years.[3][4][5] The known risks are primarily associated with training for and participation in extreme endurance events, and affect the cardiovascular system through adverse structural remodeling of the heart and the associated arteries, with heart-rhythm abnormalities perhaps being the most common resulting symptom.[6] Endurance exercise can also reduce testosterone levels.[7][8]\\r\\nCommon methods for training include periodization, intervals, hard easy, long slow distance, and in recent years high-intensity interval training. The periodization method is very common and was accredited to Tudor Bompa[9] and consists of blocks of time, generally 4ÿ12 weeks each. The blocks are called preparation, base, build and race.[10] The goal of a structured training program with periodization is to bring the athlete into peak fitness at the time of a big race or event. Preparation as the name suggests lays the groundwork for heavier work to follow. For a runner contemplating a competitive marathon the preparation phase might consist of easier runs of 1ÿ4 miles 3-4 times per week and including 2ÿ3 days of core strengthening. In the base phase the athlete now works on building cardiovascular endurance by having several long runs staying in heart rate zone 1-2[clarification needed] every week and each week adding slightly more mileage (using 10% rule for safely increasing the mileage). Core strengthening is continued in the base period. Once the base phase is complete and the athlete has sufficient endurance, the build period is needed to give the athlete the ability to hold a faster pace for the race duration. The build phase is where duration of runs is traded for intensity or heart rate zones 3-5. An easy method to obtain intensity is interval training and interval training starts to happen in the build phase. Through interval training during the build phase the athlete can achieve higher lactate threshold and in some athletes VO2 max is increased. Because interval training is demanding on the body, a professional coach should be consulted. In the very least the athlete should do a warm up and active stretching before the interval session and static stretch or yoga after hard interval sessions. It is also advisable to have days of rest or easy workouts the day after interval sessions.[11] Finally the race phase of the periodization approach is where the duration of the workouts decreases but intense workouts remain so as to keep the high lactate threshold that was gained in the build phase. In Ironman training, the race phase is where a long \\"taper\\" occurs of up to 4 weeks for highly trained Ironman racers. A final phase is designated transition and is a period of time, where the body is allowed to recover from the hard race effort and some maintenance endurance training is performed so the high fitness level attained in the previous periods will not be lost.\\r\\nTraditionally, strength training (the performance of exercises with resistance or added weight) was not deemed appropriate for endurance athletes due to potential interference in the adaptive response to the endurance elements of an athlete's training plan. There were also misconceptions regarding the addition of excess body mass through muscle hypertrophy (growth) associated with strength training, which could negatively effect endurance performance by increasing the amount of work required to be completed by the athlete. However, more recent and comprehensive research has proved that short-term (8 weeks) strength training in addition to endurance training is beneficial for endurance performance, particularly long-distance running.[12]\\r\\nThe heart rate monitor is one of the relatively easy methods to assess fitness in endurance athletes. By comparing heart rate over time fitness gains can be observed when the heart rate decreases for running or cycling at a given speed. In cycling the effect of wind on the cyclists speed is difficult to subtract out and so many cyclists now use power meters built into their bicycles. The power meter allows the athlete to actually measure power output over a set duration or course and allows direct comparison of fitness progression.[13] In the 2008 Olympics Michael Phelps was aided by repeated lactate threshold measurement. This allowed his coaches to fine tune his training program so that he could recover between swim events that were sometimes several minutes apart.[14] Much similar to blood glucose for diabetes, lower priced lactate measurement devices are now available but in general the lactate measurement approach is still the domain of the professional coach and elite athlete.","input":"What effect will endurance training have on oxidative enzymes?"},{"output":"Cuzco corn","context":"Corn nuts, also known as toasted corn,[1] corn bits[citation needed] or quicos, are a snack food made of roasted or deep-fried corn kernels.

In the rocket engine, the propellant is burnt in the combustion chamber and the hot jet of gases (usually at very high pressures, with combustion temperatures approaching 3000K) escapes through the nozzle at very high velocity.\\r\\nRocket propellant is a material used by a rocket as, or to produce in a chemical reaction, the reaction mass (propulsive mass) that is ejected, typically with very high speed, from a rocket engine to produce thrust, and thus provide spacecraft propulsion. Each rocket type requires different kind of propellant: chemical rockets require propellants capable of undergoing exothermic chemical reactions, which provide the energy to accelerate the resulting gases through the nozzle. Thermal rockets instead use inert propellants of low molecular weight that are chemically compatible with the heating mechanism at high temperatures, while cold gas thrusters use pressurized, easily stored inert gases. Electric propulsion requires propellants that are easily ionized or made into plasma, and in the extreme case of nuclear pulse propulsion the propellant consists of many small, non-weapon nuclear explosives of which the resulting shock wave of propels the spacecraft away from the explosive, thereby creating propulsion. One such spacecraft was designed (but never built), being dubbed \\"Project Orion\\" (not to be confused with the NASA Orion spacecraft).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRocket propellant is either a high oxygen containing fuel or a mixture of fuel plus oxidant, whose combustion takes place, in a definite and controlled manner with the evolution of a huge volume of gas. In the rocket engine, the propellant is burnt in the combustion chamber and the hot jet of gases (usually at a temperature of 3,000C and a pressure of 300 kg/cm^2 ) escapes through the nozzle at very high velocity. Rockets create thrust by expelling mass backwards in a high-speed jet (see Newton's Third Law). Chemical rockets, the subject of this article, create thrust by reacting propellants within a combustion chamber into a very hot gas at high pressure, which is then expanded and accelerated by passage through a nozzle at the rear of the rocket. The amount of the resulting forward force, known as thrust, that is produced is the mass flow rate of the propellants multiplied by their exhaust velocity (relative to the rocket), as specified by Newton's third law of motion. Thrust is therefore the equal and opposite reaction that moves the rocket, and not by interaction of the exhaust stream with air around the rocket. Equivalently, one can think of a rocket being accelerated upwards by the pressure of the combusting gases against the combustion chamber and nozzle. This operational principle stands in contrast to the commonly-held assumption that a rocket \\"pushes\\" against the air behind or below it. Rockets in fact perform better in outer space (where there is nothing behind or beneath them to push against), because there is a reduction in air pressure on the outside of the engine, and because it is possible to fit a longer nozzle without suffering from flow separation, in addition to the lack of air drag.\\r\\nThe maximum velocity that a rocket can attain in the absence of any external forces is primarily a function of its mass ratio and its exhaust velocity. The relationship is described by the rocket equation: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\ne\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nln\\r\\n?\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\nM\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nM\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle V_{f}=V_{e}\\\\ln(M_{0}/M_{f})}\\r\\n\\r\\n, where \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle V_{f}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the final velocity, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\ne\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle V_{e}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the exhaust velocity relative to the rocket, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nM\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle M_{0}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the initial total mass, and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nM\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle M_{f}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the mass after the propellant is burned. The mass ratio expresses what proportion of the rocket is propellant (fuel/oxidizer combination) prior to engine ignition. Typically, a single-stage rocket might have a mass fraction of 90% propellant, 10% structure, and hence a mass ratio of 9:1 . The impulse delivered by the motor to the rocket vehicle per weight of propellant consumed is the rocket propellant's specific impulse. A propellant with a higher specific impulse is said to be more efficient as more thrust is produced per unit of propellant.\\r\\nLower rocket stages usually use high-density (low volume per unit mass) propellants due to their lighter tankage to propellant weight ratios and because higher performance propellants require higher expansion ratios for maximum performance than can be attained when operated in atmosphere. Thus, the Saturn V first stage used kerosene-liquid oxygen rather than the liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen used on its upper stages. Similarly, the Space Shuttle used high-thrust, high-density solid rocket boosters for its lift-off with the liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen Space Shuttle Main Engines used partly for lift-off but primarily for orbital insertion.\\r\\nThere are four main types of chemical rocket propellants: solid, storable liquid, cryogenic liquid and liquid monopropellant. Hybrid solid/liquid bi-propellant rocket engines are starting to see limited use as well.\\r\\nSolid propellants are either \\"composites\\" composed mostly of large, distinct macroscopic particles or single-, double-, or triple-bases (depending on the number of primary ingredients), which are homogeneous mixtures of one or more primary ingredients. Composites typically consist of a mixture of granules of solid oxidizer (examples: ammonium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate, potassium nitrate) in a polymer binder (binding agent) with flakes or powders of energetic compounds (examples: RDX, HMX), metallic additives (examples: aluminium, beryllium), plasticizers, stabilizers, and/or burn rate modifiers (iron oxide, copper oxide). Single-, double-, or triple-bases are mixtures of the fuel, oxidizer, binders, and plasticizers that are macroscopically indistinguishable and often blended as liquids and cured in a single batch. Often, the ingredients of a double-base propellant have multiple roles such as RDX which is both a fuel and oxidizer or nitrocellulose which is a fuel, oxidizer, and plasticizer. Further complicating categorization, there are many propellants that contain elements of double-base and composite propellants, which often contain some amount of energetic additives homogeneously mixed into the binder. In the case of gunpowder (a pressed composite without a polymeric binder) the fuel is charcoal, the oxidizer is potassium nitrate, and sulphur serves as a catalyst. (Note: sulphur is not a true catalyst in gunpowder as it is consumed to a great extent into a variety of reaction products such as K2S.) During the 1950s and 60s researchers in the United States developed ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP). This mixture is typically 69-70% finely ground ammonium perchlorate (an oxidizer), combined with 16-20% fine aluminium powder (a fuel), held together in a base of 11-14% polybutadiene acrylonitrile (PBAN) or Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (polybutadiene rubber fuel). The mixture is formed as a thickened liquid and then cast into the correct shape and cured into a firm but flexible load-bearing solid. Historically the tally of APCP solid propellants is relatively small. The military, however, uses a wide variety of different types of solid propellants some of which exceed the performance of APCP. A comparison of the highest specific impulses achieved with the various solid and liquid propellant combinations used in current launch vehicles is given in the article on solid-fuel rockets.[1]\\r\\nSolid propellant rockets are much easier to store and handle than liquid propellant rockets. High propellant density makes for compact size as well. These features plus simplicity and low cost make solid propellant rockets ideal for military applications. In the 1970s and 1980s the U.S. switched entirely to solid-fueled ICBMs: the LGM-30 Minuteman and LG-118A Peacekeeper (MX). In the 1980s and 1990s, the USSR/Russia also deployed solid-fueled ICBMs (RT-23, RT-2PM, and RT-2UTTH), but retains two liquid-fueled ICBMs (R-36 and UR-100N). All solid-fueled ICBMs on both sides had three initial solid stages, and those with multiple independently targeted warheads had a precision maneuverable bus used to fine tune the trajectory of the re-entry vehicles. U.S. Minuteman III ICBMs were reduced to a single warhead by 2011 in accordance with the START treaty leaving only the Navy's Trident sub-launched ICBMs with multiple warheads.\\r\\nTheir simplicity also makes solid rockets a good choice whenever large amounts of thrust are needed and cost is an issue. The Space Shuttle and many other orbital launch vehicles use solid-fueled rockets in their boost stages (solid rocket boosters) for this reason.\\r\\nRelative to liquid fuel rockets, solid fuel rockets have lower specific impulse, a measure of propellant efficiency. The propellant mass ratios of solid propellant upper stages is usually in the .91 to .93 range which is as good as or better than that of most liquid propellant upper stages but overall performance is less than for liquid stages because of the solids' lower exhaust velocities. The high mass ratios possible with (unsegmented) solids is a result of high propellant density and very high strength-to-weight ratio filament-wound motor casings. A drawback to solid rockets is that they cannot be throttled in real time, although a programmed thrust schedule can be created by adjusting the interior propellant geometry. Solid rockets can be vented to extinguish combustion or reverse thrust as a means of controlling range or accommodating warhead separation. Casting large amounts of propellant requires consistency and repeatability which is assured by computer control. Casting voids in propellant can adversely affect burn rate so the blending and casting takes place under vacuum and the propellant blend is spread thin and scanned to assure no large gas bubbles are introduced into the motor. Solid fuel rockets are intolerant to cracks and voids and often require post-processing such as x-ray scans to identify faults. Since the combustion process is dependent on the surface area of the fuel; voids and cracks represent local increases in burning surface area. This increases the local temperature, system pressure and radiative heat flux to the surface. This positive feedback loop further increases burn rate and can easily lead to catastrophic failure typically due to case failure or nozzle system damage.\\r\\nThe most common liquid propellants in use today:\\r\\nThese include propellants such as the letter-coded rocket propellants used by Germany in World War II used for the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet's Walter HWK 109-509 motor and the V-2 pioneer SRBM missile, and the Soviet/Russian utilized syntin, which is synthetic cyclopropane, C10H16 which was used on Soyuz U2 until 1995.[citation needed] Syntin develops about 10 seconds greater specific impulse than kerosene.\\r\\nLiquid-fueled rockets have higher specific impulse than solid rockets and are capable of being throttled, shut down, and restarted. Only the combustion chamber of a liquid-fueled rocket needs to withstand high combustion pressures and temperatures and they can be regeneratively cooled by the liquid propellant. On vehicles employing turbopumps, the propellant tanks are at very much lower pressure than the combustion chamber. For these reasons, most orbital launch vehicles use liquid propellants.\\r\\nThe primary performance advantage of liquid propellants is due to the oxidizer. Several practical liquid oxidizers (liquid oxygen, nitrogen tetroxide, and hydrogen peroxide) are available which have better specific impulse than the ammonium perchlorate used in most solid rockets, when paired with comparable fuels. These facts have led to the use of hybrid propellants: a storable oxidizer used with a solid fuel, which retain most virtues of both liquids (high ISP) and solids (simplicity).[citation needed] (The newest nitramine solid propellants based on CL-20 (HNIW) can match the performance of NTO/UDMH storable liquid propellants, but cannot be controlled as can the storable liquids.)\\r\\nWhile liquid propellants are cheaper than solid propellants, for orbital launchers, the cost savings do not, and historically have not mattered; the cost of the propellant is a very small portion of the overall cost of the rocket.[citation needed] Some propellants, notably Oxygen and Nitrogen, may be able to be collected from the upper atmosphere, and transferred up to low-Earth orbit for use in propellant depots at substantially reduced cost.[2]\\r\\nThe main difficulties with liquid propellants are also with the oxidizers. These are generally at least moderately difficult to store and handle due to their high reactivity with common materials, may have extreme toxicity (nitric acid, nitrogen tetroxide), require moderately cryogenic storage (liquid oxygen), or both (liquid fluorine, FLOX- a fluorine/LOX mix).[3] Several exotic oxidizers have been proposed: liquid ozone (O3), ClF3, and ClF5, all of which are unstable, energetic, and toxic.\\r\\nLiquid-fueled rockets also require potentially troublesome valves and seals and thermally stressed combustion chambers, which increase the cost of the rocket. Many employ specially designed turbopumps which raise the cost enormously due to difficult fluid flow patterns that exist within the casings.\\r\\nA gas propellant usually involves some sort of compressed gas. However, due to the low density of the gas and high weight of the pressure vessel required to contain it, gases see little current use, but are sometimes used for vernier engines, particularly with inert propellants like nitrogen.[4]\\r\\nGOX (gaseous oxygen) was used as the oxidizer for the Buran program's orbital maneuvering system.\\r\\nA hybrid rocket usually has a solid fuel and a liquid or NEMA oxidizer. The fluid oxidizer can make it possible to throttle and restart the motor just like a liquid-fueled rocket. Hybrid rockets can also be environmentally safer than solid rockets since some high-performance solid-phase oxidizers contain chlorine (specifically composites with ammonium perchlorate), versus the more benign liquid oxygen or nitrous oxide often used in hybrids. This is only true for specific hybrid systems. There have been hybrids which have used chlorine or fluorine compounds as oxidizers and hazardous materials such as beryllium compounds mixed into the solid fuel grain. Because just one constituent is a fluid, hybrids can be simpler than liquid rockets depending motive force used to transport the fluid into the combustion chamber. Fewer fluids typically means fewer and smaller piping systems, valves and pumps (if utilized).\\r\\nHybrid motors suffer two major drawbacks. The first, shared with solid rocket motors, is that the casing around the fuel grain must be built to withstand full combustion pressure and often extreme temperatures as well. However, modern composite structures handle this problem well, and when used with nitrous oxide and a solid rubber propellant (HTPB), relatively small percentage of fuel is needed anyway, so the combustion chamber is not especially large.\\r\\nThe primary remaining difficulty with hybrids is with mixing the propellants during the combustion process. In solid propellants, the oxidizer and fuel are mixed in a factory in carefully controlled conditions. Liquid propellants are generally mixed by the injector at the top of the combustion chamber, which directs many small swift-moving streams of fuel and oxidizer into one another. Liquid-fueled rocket injector design has been studied at great length and still resists reliable performance prediction. In a hybrid motor, the mixing happens at the melting or evaporating surface of the fuel. The mixing is not a well-controlled process and generally quite a lot of propellant is left unburned,[5] which limits the efficiency of the motor. The combustion rate of the fuel is largely determined by the oxidizer flux and exposed fuel surface area. This combustion rate is not usually sufficient for high power operations such as boost stages unless the surface area or oxidizer flux is high. Too high of oxidizer flux can lead to flooding and loss of flame holding that locally extinguishes the combustion. Surface area can be increased, typically by longer grains or multiple ports, but this can increase combustion chamber size, reduce grain strength and/or reduce volumetric loading. Additionally, as the burn continues, the hole down the center of the grain (the 'port') widens and the mixture ratio tends to become more oxidizer rich.\\r\\nThere has been much less development of hybrid motors than solid and liquid motors. For military use, ease of handling and maintenance have driven the use of solid rockets. For orbital work, liquid fuels are more efficient than hybrids and most development has concentrated there. There has recently been an increase in hybrid motor development for nonmilitary suborbital work:\\r\\nSome work has been done on gelling liquid propellants to give a propellant with low vapor pressure to reduce the risk of an accidental fireball. Gelled propellant behaves like a solid propellant in storage and like a liquid propellant in use.\\r\\nSome rocket designs have their propellants obtain their energy from non chemical or even external sources. For example, water rockets use the compressed gas, typically air, to force the water out of the rocket.\\r\\nSolar thermal rockets and Nuclear thermal rockets typically propose to use liquid hydrogen for an Isp (Specific Impulse) of around 600ÿ900 seconds, or in some cases water that is exhausted as steam for an Isp of about 190 seconds.\\r\\nAdditionally for low performance requirements such as attitude control jets, inert gases such as nitrogen have been employed.[7]\\r\\nNuclear thermal rockets pass a propellant over a central reactor, heating the propellant and causing it to expand rapidly out a rocket nozzle, pushing the craft forward. The propellant itself is not directly interacting with the interior of the reactor, so the propellant is not irradiated.\\r\\nSolar thermal rockets use concentrated sunlight to heat a propellant, rather than using a nuclear reactor.\\r\\nThe theoretical exhaust velocity of a given propellant chemistry is a function of the energy released per unit of propellant mass (specific energy). Unburned fuel or oxidizer drags down the specific energy. However, most rockets run fuel-rich mixtures.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe usual explanation for fuel-rich mixtures is that fuel-rich mixtures have lower molecular weight exhaust, which by reducing \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle M}\\r\\n\\r\\n increases the ratio \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\nc\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {\\\\sqrt {T_{c}}}{M}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n which is approximately equal to the theoretical exhaust velocity. Fuel-rich mixtures actually have lower theoretical exhaust velocities, because \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\nc\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\sqrt {T_{c}}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n decreases as fast or faster than \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle M}\\r\\n\\r\\n.[8]\\r\\nThe nozzle of the rocket converts the thermal energy of the propellants into directed kinetic energy. This conversion happens in a short time, on the order of one millisecond. During the conversion, energy must transfer very quickly from the rotational and vibrational states of the exhaust molecules into translation. Molecules with fewer atoms (like CO and H2) store less energy in vibration and rotation than molecules with more atoms (like CO2 and H2O). These smaller molecules transfer more of their rotational and vibrational energy to translation energy than larger molecules, and the resulting improvement in nozzle efficiency is large enough that real rocket engines improve their actual exhaust velocity by running rich mixtures with somewhat lower theoretical exhaust velocities.[8]\\r\\nThe effect of exhaust molecular weight on nozzle efficiency is most important for nozzles operating near sea level. High expansion rockets operating in a vacuum see a much smaller effect, and so are run less rich. The Saturn-II stage (a LOX/LH2 rocket) varied its mixture ratio during flight to optimize performance.\\r\\nLOX/hydrocarbon rockets are run only somewhat rich (O/F mass ratio of 3 rather than stoichiometric of 3.4 to 4), because the energy release per unit mass drops off quickly as the mixture ratio deviates from stoichiometric. LOX/LH2 rockets are run very rich (O/F mass ratio of 4 rather than stoichiometric 8) because hydrogen is so light that the energy release per unit mass of propellant drops very slowly with extra hydrogen. In fact, LOX/LH2 rockets are generally limited in how rich they run by the performance penalty of the mass of the extra hydrogen tankage, rather than the mass of the hydrogen itself.[8]\\r\\nAnother reason for running rich is that off-stoichiometric mixtures burn cooler than stoichiometric mixtures, which makes engine cooling easier. Because fuel-rich combustion products are less chemically reactive (corrosive) than oxygenated products, vast majority of rocket engines are designed to run fuel-rich, with at least one exception for the Russian RD-180 preburner, which burns LOX and RP-1 at a ratio of 2.72.\\r\\nAdditionally, mixture ratios can be dynamic during launch. This can be exploited with designs that adjust the oxidizer to fuel ratio (along with overall thrust) during the flight to maximize overall system performance. For instance, during lift-off thrust is a premium while specific impulse is less so. As such, the system can be optimized by carefully adjusting the O/F ratio so the engine runs cooler at higher thrust levels. This also allows for the engine to be designed slightly more compactly, improving its overall thrust to weight performance.\\r\\nAlthough liquid hydrogen gives a high Isp, its low density is a significant disadvantage: hydrogen occupies about 7x more volume per kilogram than dense fuels such as kerosene. This not only penalises the tankage, but also the pipes and fuel pumps leading from the tank, which need to be 7x bigger and heavier. (The oxidiser side of the engine and tankage is of course unaffected.) This makes the vehicle's dry mass much higher, so the use of liquid hydrogen is not as advantageous as might be expected. Indeed, some dense hydrocarbon/LOX propellant combinations have higher performance when the dry mass penalties are included.\\r\\nDue to lower Isp, dense propellant launch vehicles have a higher takeoff mass, but this does not mean a proportionately high cost; on the contrary, the vehicle may well end up cheaper. Liquid hydrogen is quite an expensive fuel to produce and store, and causes many practical difficulties with design and manufacture of the vehicle.\\r\\nBecause of the higher overall weight, a dense-fueled launch vehicle necessarily requires higher takeoff thrust, but it carries this thrust capability all the way to orbit. This, in combination with the better thrust/weight ratios, means that dense-fueled vehicles reach orbit earlier, thereby minimizing losses due to gravity drag. Thus, the effective delta-v requirement for these vehicles are reduced.\\r\\nHowever, liquid hydrogen does give clear advantages when the overall mass needs to be minimised; for example the Saturn V vehicle used it on the upper stages; this reduced weight meant that the dense-fueled first stage could be made significantly smaller, saving quite a lot of money.\\r\\nTripropellant rockets designs often try to use an optimum mix of propellants for launch vehicles. These use mainly dense fuel while at low altitude and switch across to hydrogen at higher altitude. Studies by Robert Salkeld in the 1960s proposed SSTO using this technique.[9] The Space Shuttle approximated this by using dense solid rocket boosters for the majority of the thrust for the first 120 seconds, the main engines, burning a fuel-rich hydrogen and oxygen mixture operate continuously throughout the launch but only provide the majority of thrust at higher altitudes after SRB burnout.","input":"What kind of fuel do space rockets use?"},{"output":"John Roberts","context":" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Justice of the United States is the chief judge of the Supreme Court of the United States and thus the head of the United States federal court system, which functions as the judicial branch of the nation's federal government.

FourEdward Douglass White, Charles Evans Hughes, Harlan Fiske Stone, and William Rehnquistwere previously confirmed for associate justice and subsequently confirmed for chief justice separately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Constitution does not explicitly establish an office of Chief Justice, but presupposes its existence with a single reference in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6: \\"When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.\\" Nothing more is said in the Constitution regarding the office. Article III, Section 1, which authorizes the establishment of the Supreme Court, refers to all members of the Court simply as \\"judges.\\" The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the distinctive titles of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\\r\\nIn 1866, at the urging of Salmon P. Chase, Congress restyled the chief justice's title to the current Chief Justice of the United States. The first person whose Supreme Court commission contained the modified title was Melville Fuller in 1888.[1] The associate justices' title was not altered in 1866, and remains as originally created.\\r\\nThe chief justice, like all federal judges, is nominated by the President and confirmed to office by the U.S. Senate. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution specifies that they \\"shall hold their Offices during good Behavior\\". This language means that the appointments are effectively for life, and that, once in office, a justice's tenure ends only when they die, retire, resign, or are removed from office through the impeachment process.\\r\\nThe salary of the chief justice is set by Congress; the current (2018) annual salary is $267,000, which is slightly higher than that of associate justices, which is $255,300.[2] The practice of appointing an individual to serve as chief justice is grounded in tradition; while the Constitution mandates that there be a chief justice, it is silent on the subject of how one is chosen and by whom. There is no specific constitutional prohibition against using another method to select the chief justice from among those justices properly appointed and confirmed to the Supreme Court. Constitutional law scholar Todd Pettys has proposed that presidential appointment of chief justices should be done away with, and replaced by a process that permits the Justices to select their own chief justice.[3]\\r\\nThree incumbent associate justices have been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate as chief justice: Edward Douglass White in 1910, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1941, and William Rehnquist in 1986. A fourth, Abe Fortas, was nominated to the position in 1968, but not confirmed. As an associate justice does not have to resign his or her seat on the Court in order to be nominated as chief justice, Fortas remained an associate justice. Similarly, when associate justice William Cushing was nominated and confirmed as chief justice in January 1796, but declined the office, he too remained on the Court. Additionally, two former associate justices subsequently returned to service on the Court as chief justice. John Rutledge was the first. President Washington gave him a recess appointment in 1795. However, his subsequent nomination to the office was not confirmed by the Senate, and he left office and the Court. In 1933, former associate justice Charles Evans Hughes was confirmed as chief justice.\\r\\nAlong with his general responsibilities as a member of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice has several unique duties to fulfill.\\r\\nArticle I, section 3 of the U.S. Constitution stipulates that the Chief Justice shall preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States in the U.S. Senate. Two Chief Justices, Salmon P. Chase and William Rehnquist, have presided over the trial in the Senate that follows an impeachment of the president ÿ Chase in 1868 over the proceedings against President Andrew Johnson and Rehnquist in 1999 over the proceedings against President Bill Clinton. Both presidents were subsequently acquitted.\\r\\nMany of the procedures and inner workings of the Court turn on the seniority of the justices. Traditionally, the chief justice has been regarded as primus inter pares (first among equals)that is, the chief justice is the highest-ranking and foremost member of the Court, regardless of that officeholder's length of service when compared against that of any associate justice. This seniority and added prestige enables a chief justice to define the Court's culture and norms, and thus influence how it functions. The chief justice sets the agenda for the weekly meetings where the justices review the petitions for certiorari, to decide whether to hear or deny each case. The Supreme Court agrees to hear less than one percent of the cases petitioned to it. While associate justices may append items to the weekly agenda, in practice this initial agenda-setting power of the chief justice has significant influence over the direction of the court. Nonetheless, a chief justice's influence may be limited by circumstances and the associate justices' understanding of legal principles; it is definitely limited by the fact that he has only a single vote of nine on the decision whether to grant or deny certiorari.[4][5]\\r\\nDespite the chief justice's elevated stature, his vote carries the same legal weight as the vote of each associate justice. Additionally, he has no legal authority to overrule the verdicts or interpretations of the other eight judges or tamper with them.[4] The task of assigning who shall write the opinion for the majority falls to the most senior justice in the majority. Thus, when the chief justice is in the majority, he always assigns the opinion.[6] Early in his tenure, Chief Justice John Marshall insisted upon holdings which the justices could unanimously back as a means to establish and build the Court's national prestige. In doing so, Marshall would often write the opinions himself, and actively discouraged dissenting opinions. Associate Justice William Johnson eventually persuaded Marshall and the rest of the Court to adopt its present practice: one justice writes an opinion for the majority, and the rest are free to write their own separate opinions or not, whether concurring or dissenting.[7]\\r\\nThe chief justice's formal prerogativewhen in the majorityto assign which justice will write the Court's opinion is perhaps his most influential power,[5] as this enables him to influence the historical record.[4] He \\"may assign this task to the individual justice best able to hold together a fragile coalition, to an ideologically amenable colleague, or to himself.\\" Opinion authors can have a big influence on the content of an opinion; two justices in the same majority, given the opportunity, might write very different majority opinions.[5] A chief justice who knows well the associate justices can therefore do muchby the simple act of selecting the justice who writes the opinion of the courtto affect the general character or tone of an opinion, which in turn can affect the interpretation of that opinion in cases before lower courts in the years to come.\\r\\nAdditionally, the chief justice chairs the conferences where cases are discussed and tentatively voted on by the justices. He normally speaks first and so has influence in framing the discussion. Although the chief justice votes firstthe Court votes in order of seniorityhe may strategically pass in order to ensure membership in the majority if desired.[5] It is reported that:\\r\\nChief Justice Warren Burger was renowned, and even vilified in some quarters, for voting strategically during conference discussions on the Supreme Court in order to control the Courts agenda through opinion assignment. Indeed, Burger is said to have often changed votes to join the majority coalition, cast \\"phony votes\\" by voting against his preferred position, and, declined to express a position at conference.[8]\\r\\nThe Chief Justice typically administers the oath of office at the inauguration of the President of the United States. This is a tradition, rather than a constitutional responsibility of the Chief Justice; the Constitution does not require that the oath be administered by anyone in particular, simply that it be taken by the president. Law empowers any federal and state judge, as well as notaries public (such as John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.), to administer oaths and affirmations.\\r\\nIf the Chief Justice is ill or incapacitated, the oath is usually administered by the next senior member of the Supreme Court. Seven times, someone other than the Chief Justice of the United States administered the oath of office to the President.[9] Robert Livingston, as Chancellor of the State of New York (the state's highest ranking judicial office), administered the oath of office to George Washington at his first inauguration; there was no Chief Justice of the United States, nor any other federal judge prior to their appointments by President Washington in the months following his inauguration. William Cushing, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, administered Washington's second oath of office in 1793. Calvin Coolidge's father, a notary public, administered the oath to his son after the death of Warren Harding.[10] This, however, was contested upon Coolidge's return to Washington and his oath was re-administered by Judge Adolph A. Hoehling, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.[11] John Tyler and Millard Fillmore were both sworn in on the death of their predecessors by Chief Justice William Cranch of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.[12] Chester A. Arthur and Theodore Roosevelt's initial oaths reflected the unexpected nature of their taking office. On November 22, 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Judge Sarah T. Hughes, a federal district court judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, administered the oath of office to then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson aboard the presidential airplane.\\r\\nIn addition, the Chief Justice ordinarily administers the oath of office to newly appointed and confirmed associate justices, whereas the senior associate justice will normally swear in a new Chief Justice or vice president.\\r\\nSince the tenure of William Howard Taft, the office of the Chief Justice has moved beyond just first among equals.[13] The Chief Justice also:\\r\\nUnlike Senators and Representatives who are constitutionally prohibited from holding any other \\"office of trust or profit\\" of the United States or of any state while holding their congressional seats, the Chief Justice and the other members of the federal judiciary are not barred from serving in other positions. Chief Justice John Jay served as a diplomat to negotiate the so-called Jay Treaty (also known as the Treaty of London of 1794), Justice Robert H. Jackson was appointed by President Truman to be the U.S. Prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials of leading Nazis, and Chief Justice Earl Warren chaired The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. As described above, the Chief Justice holds office in the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress.\\r\\nUnder 28 USC,[15] when the Chief Justice is unable to discharge his functions, or that office is vacant, his duties are carried out by the most senior associate justice who is able to act, until the disability or vacancy ends, as chief justice.[3] As of February 13, 2016, Anthony Kennedy is the most senior associate justice.\\r\\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, the following 17 persons have served as Chief Justice:[16][17]","input":"Who is the chief justice of the usa?"},{"output":"1,356","context":"Deer Creek Public Schools serves students in northwestern Oklahoma County and southwestern Logan County in Oklahoma. Based in Edmond, Oklahoma, the district serves approximately 3,741 students.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are eight schools in the district: Deer Creek High School, Deer Creek Intermediate School, Deer Creek Middle School, Deer Creek Elementary School, Deer Creek Prairie Vale Elementary School, Deer Creek Rose Union Elementary School, Deer Creek Grove Valley Elementary School, and Deer Creek Spring Creek Elementary School.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeer Creek opened in 1921. Deer Creek is a growing community sprawling over the border between Oklahoma County and Logan County.  It is named for the nearby Deer Creek, which snakes through much of the district and occasionally causes the schools to close by flooding during the spring rains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis region of Oklahoma was part of the Unassigned Lands and was settled during the Oklahoma Land Run of 1889.[2] Before the land run began, the area was surveyed into sections by the federal Public Land Survey System, with each section measuring one mile (1.6?km) by one mile, and divided evenly into 160-acre (0.65?km2) homesteads, called quarter-sections.[3] Sections were organized into larger entities, called townships, that consisted of 36 numbered sections. Following a pattern set during the settling of the Northwest Territories in 1787, the Organic Act dedicated section No. 16 for the support of public schools. In the Deer Creek Public School District, both northern quarters and the southwestern quarter were sold to raise funds to build the school. The first school was built on the southeast quarter-section, at what is now called N. MacArthur Boulevard and W. 206th Street in the unincorporated part of Oklahoma County.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Great Depression, the federal Works Project Administration built a one-story, red-brick school at the far southeastern corner of this quarter-section. This building included a half-court basketball gymnasium, about a dozen classrooms, and a small library.  A gymnasium and separate cafeteria were added later.  The buildings have since been demolished, but the trees that surrounded the building are still present, and part of the building's brick facade is used on the entrance to the high school's auditorium.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the early 1980s, the district has expanded considerably due to exurban sprawl.  It now has five elementary schools, none of which are at the original location. Prairie Vale Elementary School was the first school built away from the original site. It is near the western border of the City of Edmond and on the border of northwest Oklahoma City. Deer Creek Elementary moved several miles south and serves primarily students living in the Memorial and MacArthur area of Oklahoma City. Rose Union is one mile (1.6?km) northeast of the original site and draws students from the largest section of the school district. Grove Valley covers the nw 192nd and Portland (Highway 74) area. In the 2008-09 school year, the four elementary schools enrolled a total of 1,850 students in grades Pre-K through 5.[4] A 5th Elementary, Spring Creek Elementary, opened in August 2013 and is located off of Rockwell and 150th.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeer Creek High School (DCHS) is located in northern Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, north of Oklahoma City and west of Edmond on the northwest corner of NW 206th Street and MacArthur Boulevard.  The high school has dramatically expanded over the past half-decade. The high school facilities include a two-story annex, a freshman academy, Alumni Hall, the old gym, a PAAC (Performing Arts & Athletic Center), a multi-sport complex, and a new football stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new middle school is located on NW 234th Street just east of N.

This measure recognizes poverty as a lack of those goods and services commonly taken for granted by members of mainstream society.[2] The official threshold is adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index.\\r\\nMost Americans will spend at least one year below the poverty line at some point between ages 25 and 75.[3] Poverty rates are persistently higher in rural and inner city parts of the country as compared to suburban areas.[4][5]\\r\\nIn 2015, 13.5% (43.1 million) of Americans lived in poverty.[6] Starting in the 1930s, relative poverty rates have consistently exceeded those of other wealthy nations.[7] The lowest poverty rates are found in New Hampshire, Vermont, Minnesota and Nebraska, which have between 8.7% and 9.1% of their population living in poverty.[8]\\r\\nIn 2009 the number of people who were in poverty was approaching 1960s levels that led to the national War on Poverty.[9] In 2011 extreme poverty in the United States, meaning households living on less than $2 per day before government benefits, was double 1996 levels at 1.5 million households, including 2.8 million children.[10]\\r\\nIn 2012 the percentage of seniors living in poverty was 14% while 18% of children were.[11] The addition of Social Security benefits contributed more to reduce poverty than any other factor.[12]\\r\\nRecent census data shows that half the population qualifies as poor or low income,[13] with one in five Millennials living in poverty.[14] Academic contributors to The Routledge Handbook of Poverty in the United States postulate that new and extreme forms of poverty have emerged in the U.S. as a result of neoliberal structural adjustment policies and globalization, which have rendered economically marginalized communities as destitute \\"surplus populations\\" in need of control and punishment.[15]\\r\\nIn 2011, child poverty reached record high levels, with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels.[16] A 2013 UNICEF report ranked the U.S. as having the second highest relative child poverty rates in the developed world.[17] According to a 2016 study by the Urban Institute, teenagers in low income communities are often forced to join gangs, save school lunches, sell drugs or exchange sexual favors because they cannot afford food.[18]\\r\\nThere were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless people nationwide in January 2009. Almost two-thirds stayed in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program and the other third were living on the street, in an abandoned building, or another place not meant for human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009.[19] Around 44% of homeless people are employed.[20]\\r\\nIn June 2016, the IMF warned the United States that its high poverty rate needs to be tackled urgently by raising the minimum wage and offering paid maternity leave to women to encourage them to enter the labor force.[21] In December 2017, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, undertook a two week investigation on the effects of systemic poverty in the United States, and sharply condemned \\"private wealth and public squalor\\".[22]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two basic versions of the federal poverty measure: the poverty thresholds (which are the primary version); and the poverty guidelines. The Census Bureau issues the poverty thresholds, which are generally used for statistical purposes[23]for example, to estimate the number of people in poverty nationwide each year and classify them by type of residence, race, and other social, economic, and demographic characteristics. The Department of Health and Human Services issues the poverty guidelines for administrative purposesfor instance, to determine whether a person or family is eligible for assistance through various federal programs.[24]\\r\\nThe \\"Orshansky Poverty Thresholds\\" form the basis for the current measure of poverty in the U.S. Mollie Orshansky was an economist working for the Social Security Administration (SSA). Her work appeared at an opportune moment. Orshansky's article was published later in the same year that Johnson declared war on poverty. Since her measure was absolute (i.e., did not depend on other events), it made it possible to objectively answer whether the U.S. government was \\"winning\\" this war. The newly formed United States Office of Economic Opportunity adopted the lower of the Orshansky poverty thresholds for statistical, planning, and budgetary purposes in May 1965.\\r\\nThe Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget) adopted Orshansky's definition for statistical use in all Executive departments. The measure gave a range of income cutoffs, or thresholds, adjusted for factors such as family size, sex of the family head, number of children under 18 years old, and farm or non-farm residence. The economy food plan (the least costly of four nutritionally adequate food plans designed by the Department of Agriculture) was at the core of this definition of poverty.[25]\\r\\nAt the time of creating the poverty definition, the Department of Agriculture found that families of three or more persons spent about one third of their after-tax income on food. For these families, poverty thresholds were set at three times the cost of the economy food plan. Different procedures were used for calculating poverty thresholds for two-person households and persons living alone. Annual updates of the SSA poverty thresholds were based on price changes in the economy food plan, but updates do not reflect other changes (food is no longer one-third of the after-tax income). Two changes were made to the poverty definition in 1969. Thresholds for non-farm families were tied to annual changes in the Consumer Price Index rather than changes in the cost of the economy food plan. Farm thresholds were raised from 70 to 85% of the non-farm levels.\\r\\nIn 1981, further changes were made to the poverty definition. Separate thresholds for \\"farm\\" and \\"female-householder\\" families were eliminated. The largest family size category became \\"nine persons or more.\\"[25]\\r\\nApart from these changes, the U.S. government's approach to measuring poverty has remained static for the past forty years.\\r\\nThe poverty guideline figures are not the figures the Census Bureau uses to calculate the number of poor persons. The figures that the Census Bureau uses are the poverty thresholds. The Census Bureau provides an explanation of the difference between poverty thresholds and guidelines.[27] The Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty.[28] The 2010 figure for a family of 4 with no children under 18 years of age is $22,541, while the figure for a family of 4 with 2 children under 18 is $22,162.[29] For comparison, the 2011 HHS poverty guideline for a family of 4 is $22,350.\\r\\nAnother way of looking at poverty is in relative terms. \\"Relative poverty\\" can be defined as having significantly less income and wealth than other members of society. Therefore, the relative poverty rate is a measure of income inequality. When the standard of living among those in more financially advantageous positions rises while that of those considered poor stagnates, the relative poverty rate will reflect such growing income inequality and increase. Conversely, the relative poverty rate can decrease, with low income people coming to have less wealth and income if wealthier people's wealth is reduced by a larger percentage than theirs.\\r\\nSome critics[who?] argue that relying on income disparity to determine who is impoverished can be misleading. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data suggests that consumer spending varies much less than income. In 2008, the poorest one fifth of Americans households spent on average $12,955 per person for goods and services (other than taxes), the second quintile spent $14,168, the third $16,255, the fourth $19,695, while the richest fifth spent $26,644. The disparity of expenditures is much less than the disparity of income.[30][neutrality is disputed]\\r\\nAlthough the relative approach theoretically differs largely from the Orshansky definition, crucial variables of both poverty definitions are more similar than often thought. First, the so-called standardization of income in both approaches is very similar. To make incomes comparable among households of different sizes, equivalence scales are used to standardize household income to the level of a single person household. When compared to the US Census poverty line, which is based on a defined basket of goods, for the most prevalent household types both standardization methods show very similar results.\\r\\nIn addition to family status, race/ethnicity and age also correlate with high poverty rates in the United States. Although data regarding race and poverty are more extensively published and cross tabulated, the family status correlation is by far the strongest.\\r\\nAccording to the US Census, in 2007 5.8% of all people in married families lived in poverty,[35] as did 26.6% of all persons in single parent households[35] and 19.1% of all persons living alone.[35] More than 75% of all poor households are headed by women (2012).[36]\\r\\nAmong married couple families: 5.8% lived in poverty.[35] This number varied by race and ethnicity as follows:\\r\\n5.4% of all white persons (which includes white Hispanics),[37]\\r\\n10.7% of all black persons (which includes black Hispanics),[38] and\\r\\n14.9% of all Hispanic persons (of any race)[39] living in poverty.\\r\\nAmong single parent (male or female) families: 26.6% lived in poverty.[35] This number varied by race and ethnicity as follows:\\r\\n22.5% of all white persons (which includes white Hispanics),[37]\\r\\n44.0% of all black persons (which includes black Hispanics),[38] and\\r\\n33.4% of all Hispanic persons (of any race)[39] living in poverty.\\r\\nAmong individuals living alone: 19.1% lived in poverty.[35] This number varied by race and ethnicity as follows:\\r\\n18% of white persons (which includes white Hispanics)[40]\\r\\n28.9% of black persons (which includes black Hispanics)[39] and\\r\\n27% of Hispanic persons (of any race)[41] living in poverty.\\r\\nThe US Census declared that in 2014 14.8% of the general population lived in poverty:[42]\\r\\n10.1% of all white non-Hispanic persons\\r\\n12.0% of all Asian persons\\r\\n23.6% of all Hispanic persons (of any race)\\r\\n26.2% of all African American persons\\r\\n28.3% of Native Americans / Alaska Natives\\r\\nAs of 2010 about half of those living in poverty are non-Hispanic white (19.6 million).[42] Non-Hispanic white children comprised 57% of all poor rural children.[43]\\r\\nIn FY 2009, African American families comprised 33.3% of TANF families, non-Hispanic white families comprised 31.2%, and 28.8% were Hispanic.[44]\\r\\nPoverty is also notoriously high on Native American reservations (see Reservation poverty). 7 of the 11 poorest counties in per capita income, including the 2 poorest in the U.S., encompass Lakota Sioux reservations in South Dakota.[45] This fact has been cited by some critics as a mechanism that enables the \\"kidnapping\\" of Lakota children by the state of South Dakota's Department of Social Services. The Lakota People's Law Project,[46] among other critics, allege that South Dakota \\"inappropriately equates economic poverty with neglect?... South Dakota's rate of identifying 'neglect' is 18% higher than the national average?... In 2010, the national average of state discernment of neglect, as a percent of total maltreatment of foster children prior to their being taken into custody by the state, was 78.3%. In South Dakota the rate was 95.8%.\\"[47]\\r\\nPoverty in the Pine Ridge Reservation in particular has had unprecedented effects on its residents' longevity. \\"Recent reports state the average life expectancy is 45 years old while others state that it is 48 years old for men and 52 years old for women.

The study claims that in 11 states, Louisiana, which has the highest rate, followed by North Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho and Arkansas, more than 20 percent of children under 5 are allegedly at risk of going hungry. (Receiving fewer than 1,800 calories per day) The study was paid by ConAgra Foods, a large food company.[50]\\r\\nIn 2012, 16.1 million American children were living in poverty. Outside of the 49 million Americans living in food insecure homes, 15.9 million of them were children.[51] In 2013, child poverty reached record high levels in the U.S., with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households. Many of the neighborhoods these children live in lack basic produce and nutritious food. 47 million Americans depend on food banks, more than 30% above 2007 levels. Households headed by single mothers are most likely to be affected. 30 percent of low-income single mothers cannot afford diapers.[52] Inability to afford this necessity can cause a chain reaction, including mental, health, and behavioral problems. Some women are forced to make use of one or two diapers, using them more than once. This causes rashes and sanitation problems as well as health problems. Without diapers, children are unable to enter into daycare. The lack of childcare can be detrimental to single mothers, hindering their ability to obtain employment.[52] Worst affected are Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, and the District of Columbia, while North Dakota, New Hampshire, Virginia, Minnesota and Massachusetts are the least affected.[16] 31 million low-income children received free or reduced-price meals daily through the National School lunch program during the 2012 federal fiscal year. Nearly 14 million children are estimated to be served by Feeding America with over 3 million being of the ages of 5 and under.[53]\\r\\nA 2014 report by the National Center on Family Homelessness states the number of homeless children in the U.S. has reached record levels, calculating that 2.5 million children, or one child in every 30, experienced homelessness in 2013. High levels of poverty, lack of affordable housing and domestic violence were cited as the primary causes.[54]\\r\\nPoverty affects individual access to quality education. The U.S. education system is often funded by local communities; therefore the quality of materials and teachers can reflect the affluence of community. That said, many communities address this by supplementing these areas with funds from other districts. Low income communities are often not able to afford the quality education that high income communities do. Poor perceptions, by teachers, of families and communities in poverty can manifest itself in teachers who will not put forth the effort to teach and students who are thought to be opposed to learning; in both cases poor students are thought to be incapable.[55] When a teacher assumes a child is linguistically deficient, they may look through a stigmatized lens when working with the student. This can create an atmosphere that can reify negative stereotypes and undermine student motivation.[56] By the teacher not looking through such a lens, they will be able to reinforce the idea that all their students have an opportunity to increase their learning abilities, which can result in more classroom engagement and student motivation.[57] Females in poverty are also likely to become pregnant at a young age, and with fewer resources to care for a child, young women often drop out of school.[58] A reason for the gap in access to education is due to the fact that reforms in the instruction programs have not been implemented well or at all in high poverty schools.[59] Due to these and other reasons the quality of education between the classes is not equal.[60]\\r\\nSome teachers will use the phrase culture of poverty as a taxonomy of lower socioeconomic students and will use child poverty as an excuse for why they are not successful with certain students.[61] The culture of poverty acknowledges the past factors of the initial condition of poverty were results of racial segregation and discrimination, and substandard housing and education, ignoring personal responsibility, yet puts the blame on the behaviors and attitudes of the poor, as the cause of present poverty.[62] This idea ignores the very fact that the current housing and education in poverty is still substandard and plays a large role in the cause of present poverty,.[62] Some people point out that poverty is a choice; that single parent families are more often to be below the poverty line.\\r\\nThere are multiple misconceptions in regards to poverty. Research has undermined the idea that parents of low socioeconomic status do not value education, when in truth they hold the same attitudes as wealthy families.[63] It is not an issue of value, but more so a problem of access.[64] A parent from a lower socioeconomic class is likely to have more factors than a parent from a wealthy socioeconomic class that may affect their involvement with their childs education. For instance a person living in poverty is more likely to work multiple jobs, as well as not having certain means of transportation, thus hindering their access to their childs education.[65] The teachers, faculty, and administrators of the schools have to take these real-life factors into consideration.\\r\\n89 percent of the American households were food secure throughout the entire year of 2002, meaning that they had access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life for all of the household members. The remaining households were food insecure at least some time during that year. The prevalence of food insecurity rose from 10.7% in 2001 to 11.1% in 2002, and the prevalence of food insecurity with hunger rose from 3.3% to 3.5%.[66]\\r\\nIn 2007, 88.9% of American households were food secure throughout the entire year.[67] The number of American households that were food secure throughout the entire year dropped to 85.4% in 2008.[68] As of 2012, the prevalence of food insecurity has been essentially unchanged since 2008.[69]\\r\\nThere are numerous factors related to poverty in the United States.\\r\\nIn recent years, there have been a number of concerns raised about the official U.S. poverty measure. In 1995, the National Research Council's Committee on National Statistics convened a panel on measuring poverty. The findings of the panel were that \\"the official poverty measure in the United States is flawed and does not adequately inform policy-makers or the public about who is poor and who is not poor.\\"\\r\\nThe panel was chaired by Robert Michael, former Dean of the Harris School of the University of Chicago. According to Michael, the official U.S. poverty measure \\"has not kept pace with far-reaching changes in society and the economy.\\" The panel proposed a model based on disposable income:\\r\\nMany sociologists and government officials have argued that poverty in the United States is understated, meaning that there are more households living in actual poverty than there are households below the poverty threshold.[92] A recent NPR report states that as many as 30% of Americans have trouble making ends meet and other advocates have made supporting claims that the rate of actual poverty in the US is far higher than that calculated by using the poverty threshold.[92] A study taken in 2012 estimated that roughly 38% of Americans live \\"paycheck to paycheck.\\"[93]\\r\\nAccording to William H. Chafe, if one used a relative standard for measuring poverty (a standard that took into account the rising standards of living rather than an absolute dollar figure) then 18% of families were living in poverty in 1968, not 13% as officially estimated at that time.[94]\\r\\nAs far back as 1969, the Bureau of Labor Statistics put forward suggested budgets for adequate family living. 60% of working-class Americans lived below one of these budgets, which suggested that a far higher proportion of Americans lived in poverty than the official poverty line suggested. These findings were also used by observers on the left when questioning the long-established view that most Americans had attained an affluent standard of living in the two decades following the end of the Second World War.[95][96]\\r\\nUsing a definition of relative poverty (reflecting disposable income below half the median of adjusted national income), it was estimated that, between 1979 and 1982, 17.1% of Americans lived in poverty.[97]\\r\\nAs noted above, the poverty thresholds used by the US government were originally developed during the Johnson administration's War on Poverty initiative in 1963ÿ1964.[98][99] Mollie Orshansky, the government economist working at the Social Security Administration who developed the thresholds, based the threshold levels on the cost of purchasing what in the mid-1950s had been determined by the US Department of Agriculture to be the minimal nutritionally-adequate amount of food necessary to feed a family. Orshansky multiplied the cost of the food basket by a factor of three, under the assumption that the average family spent one third of its income on food.\\r\\nWhile the poverty threshold is updated for inflation every year, the basket of food used to determine what constitutes being deprived of a socially acceptable minimum standard of living has not been updated since 1955. As a result, the current poverty line only takes into account food purchases that were common more than 50 years ago, updating their cost using the Consumer Price Index. When methods similar to Orshansky's were used to update the food basket using prices for the year 2000 instead of from nearly a half century earlier, it was found that the poverty line should actually be 200% higher than the official level being used by the government in that year.[100]\\r\\nYet even that higher level could still be considered flawed, as it would be based almost entirely on food costs and on the assumption that families still spend a third of their income on food. In fact, Americans typically spent less than one tenth of their after-tax income on food in 2000.[101] For many families, the costs of housing, health insurance and medical care, transportation, and access to basic telecommunications take a much larger bite out of the family's income today than a half century ago; yet, as noted above,[98][99] none of these costs are considered in determining the official poverty thresholds. According to John Schwarz, a political scientist at the University of Arizona:\\r\\nThe issue of understating poverty is especially pressing in states with both a high cost of living and a high poverty rate such as California where the median home price in May 2006 was determined to be $564,430.[102] In the Monterey area, where the low-pay industry of agriculture is the largest sector in the economy and the majority of the population lacks a college education, the median home price was determined to be $723,790, requiring an upper middle class income only earned by roughly 20% of all households in the county.[102][103]\\r\\nSuch fluctuations in local markets are, however, not considered in the Federal poverty threshold and thus leave many who live in poverty-like conditions out of the total number of households classified as poor.\\r\\nIn 2011, the Census Bureau introduced a new supplemental poverty measure aimed at providing a more accurate picture of the true extent of poverty in the United States. The SPM extends the official poverty measure by taking account of many of the government programs designed to assist low-income families and individuals that are not included in the current official poverty measure.[8] According to this new measure, 16% of Americans lived in poverty in 2011, compared with the official figure of 15.2%. The new measure also estimated that nearly half of all Americans lived in poverty that year, defined as living within 200% of the federal poverty line.[104]\\r\\nDuke University Professor of Public Policy and Economics Sandy Darity, Jr. says, \\"There is no exact way of measuring poverty. The measures are contingent on how we conceive of and define poverty. Efforts to develop more refined measures have been dominated by researchers who intentionally want to provide estimates that reduce the magnitude of poverty.\\"[105]\\r\\nAccording to an 2017 academic study by MIT economist Peter Temin, Americans trapped in poverty live in conditions rivaling the developing world, and are forced to contend with substandard education, dilapidated housing, and few stable employment opportunities.[106] A 2017 study published in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene found that hookworm, a parasite that thrives on extreme poverty, is flourishing in the Deep South. A report on the study in The Guardian stated:\\r\\nScientists in Houston, Texas, have lifted the lid on one of Americas darkest and deepest secrets: that hidden beneath fabulous wealth, the US tolerates poverty-related illness at levels comparable to the worlds poorest countries. More than one in three people sampled in a poor area of Alabama tested positive for traces of hookworm, a gastrointestinal parasite that was thought to have been eradicated from the US decades ago.[107]\\r\\nAccording to Philip Alston, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, 19 million people live in deep poverty (a total family income that is below one-half of the poverty threshold) in the United States as of 2017.[22]\\r\\nSome critics assert that the official U.S. poverty definition is inconsistent with how it is defined by its own citizens and the rest of the world, because the U.S. government considers many citizens statistically impoverished despite their ability to sufficiently meet their basic needs. According to a heavily criticised[108][109][110][111] 2011 paper by The Heritage Foundation research fellow Robert Rector, of the 43.6 million Americans deemed by the U.S. Census Bureau to be below the poverty level in 2009, the majority had adequate shelter, food, clothing and medical care. In addition, the paper stated that those assessed as below the poverty line in 2011 have a much higher quality of living than those who were identified by the census 40 years ago as being in poverty. For example, in 2005, 63.7% of those living in poverty had cable or satellite television. In some cases the report even said that people currently living in poverty were actually better off than middle class people of the recent past. For example, in 2005, 78.3% of households living in poverty had air conditioning, whereas in 1970, 36.0% of all households had air conditioning.[112][113]\\r\\nAccording to The Heritage Foundation, the federal poverty line also excludes income other than cash income, especially welfare benefits. Thus, if food stamps and public housing were successfully raising the standard of living for poverty stricken individuals, then the poverty line figures would not shift, since they do not consider the income equivalents of such entitlements.[114]\\r\\nA 1993 study of low income single mothers titled Making Ends Meet, by Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, showed that the mothers spent more than their reported incomes because they could not \\"make ends meet\\" without such expenditures. According to Edin, they made up the difference through contributions from family members, absent boyfriends, off-the-book jobs, and church charity.\\r\\nAccording to Edin: \\"No one avoided the unnecessary expenditures, such as the occasional trip to the Dairy Queen, or a pair of stylish new sneakers for the son who might otherwise sell drugs to get them some money or something, or the Cable TV subscription for the kids home alone and you are afraid they will be out on the street if they are not watching TV.\\" However many mothers skipped meals or did odd jobs to cover those expenses. According to Edin, for \\"most welfare-reliant mothers food and shelter alone cost almost as much as these mothers received from the government. For more than one-third, food and housing costs exceeded their cash benefits, leaving no extra money for uncovered medical care, clothing, and other household expenses.\\"[115]\\r\\nIn the age of inequality, such anti-poverty policies are more important than ever, as higher inequality creates both more poverty along with steeper barriers to getting ahead, whether through the lack of early education, nutrition, adequate housing, and a host of other poverty-related conditions that dampen ones chances in life.\\r\\nThere have been many governmental and nongovernmental efforts to reduce poverty and its effects. These range in scope from neighborhood efforts to campaigns with a national focus. They target specific groups affected by poverty such as children, people who are autistic, immigrants, or people who are homeless. Efforts to alleviate poverty use a disparate set of methods, such as advocacy, education, social work, legislation, direct service or charity, and community organizing.\\r\\nRecent debates have centered on the need for policies that focus on both \\"income poverty\\" and \\"asset poverty.\\"[117] Advocates for the approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus solely on supplementing the income of the poor through programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Food Stamps. According to the CFED 2012 Assets & Opportunity Scorecard, 27 percent of households ÿ nearly double the percentage that are income poor ÿ are living in \\"asset poverty.\\" These families do not have the savings or other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income. Since 2009, the number of asset poor families has increased by 21 percent from about one in five families to one in four families. In order to provide assistance to such asset poor families, Congress appropriated $24 million to administer the Assets for Independence Program under the supervision of the US Department for Health and Human Services. The program enables community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement Individual Development Account or IDA programs, which are an asset-based development initiative. Every dollar accumulated in IDA savings is matched by federal and non-federal funds to enable households to add to their assets portfolio by buying their first home, acquiring a post-secondary education, or starting or expanding a small business.[118]\\r\\nAdditionally, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC or EIC) is a credit for people who earn low-to-moderate incomes. This credit allows them to get money from the government if their total tax outlay is less than the total credit earned, meaning it is not just a reduction in total tax paid but can also bring new income to the household. The Earned Income Tax Credit is viewed as the largest poverty reduction program in the United States. There is an ongoing debate in the U.S. about what the most effective way to fight poverty is, through the tax code with the EITC, or through the minimum wage laws.\\r\\nGovernment safety net programs put in place since the War on Poverty have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself has done little to reduce poverty. According to the 2013 Columbia University study which created the (SPM) method of measuring poverty, without such programs the poverty rate would be 29% today.[119] An analysis of the study by Kevin Drum suggests the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty among the elderly but provides relatively little assistance to the working-age poor.[120] A 2014 study by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that without social programs like food stamps, social security and the federal EITC, the poverty rate in the U.S. would be much higher.[121] Nevertheless, the U.S. has the weakest social safety net of all developed nations.[122][123][124] Sociologist Monica Prasad of Northwestern University argues that this developed because of government intervention rather than lack of it, which pushed consumer credit for meeting citizens' needs rather than applying social welfare policies as in Europe.[125]","input":"When was the usa's official poverty definition created?"},{"output":"in West Texas, bordering Mexico","context":"For the Texas state park see: Big Bend Ranch State Park\\r\\nBig Bend National Park is a United States National Park located in West Texas, bordering Mexico. It has national significance as the largest protected area of Chihuahuan Desert topography and ecology in the United States. It contains more than 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds, 56 species of reptiles, and 75 species of mammals.[3]\\r\\nThe park has many geological features including sea fossils and dinosaur bones, as well as volcanic dikes. The area is also rich in cultural history: from archeological sites dating back nearly 10,000 years to more recent pioneers, ranchers, and miners[4].\\r\\nThe national park covers 801,163 acres (324,219?ha).[1] For more than 1,000 miles (1,600?km), the Rio Grande/Ro Bravo forms the boundary between Mexico and the United States, and Big Bend National Park administers approximately 118 miles (190?km) along that boundary. The park was named after a large bend in the river and TexasMexico border.[5][6][7]\\r\\nBecause the Rio Grande serves as an international boundary, the park faces unusual constraints while administering and enforcing park rules, regulations, and policies. In accordance with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the park's territory extends only to the center of the deepest river channel as the river flowed in 1848. The rest of the land south of that channel, and the river, lies within Mexican territory. The park is bordered by the protected areas of Parque Nacional Ca?on de Santa Elena and Maderas del Carmen in Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park exhibits dramatic contrasts and its climate may be characterized as one of extremes. Dry and hot late spring and summer days often exceed 100?F (38?C) in the lower elevations. Winters are normally mild but subfreezing temperatures occasionally occur. Because of the range in altitude from about 1,800 feet (550?m) along the river to Emory Peak in the Chisos Mountains at 7,832 feet (2,387?m),[3] a wide variation in available moisture and temperature exists throughout the park. These variations contribute to an exceptional diversity in plant and animal habitats. Some species in the park, such as the Chisos oak (Quercus graciliformis), are found nowhere else in the United States.\\r\\nThe 118?mi (190?km) of river that form the southern park boundary include the spectacular canyons of Santa Elena, Mariscal, and Boquillas. The Rio Grande, which meanders through this portion of the Chihuahuan Desert, has cut deep canyons with nearly vertical walls through three uplifts made primarily of limestone. Throughout the open desert areas, the highly productive Rio Grande riparian zone includes numerous plant and animal species and significant cultural resources. The vegetative belt extends into the desert along creeks and arroyos.\\r\\nSouth of the border lie the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Coahuila and newly protected areas for flora and fauna, which are regions known as the Maderas del Carmen and the Ca?܇n de Santa Elena.\\r\\nIn 2012, the park was named as an international dark-sky park by the International Dark-Sky Association, which recognized the park as one of only 10 places in the world certified for dark-sky stargazing. In addition, the association recognized the park as having the darkest measured skies in the lower 48 United States. On many nights, park visitors can look up to the night's sky to see thousands of stars, bright planets, and the clear outline of the Milky Way band. Astronomers, both professional and amateur, are seen on many moonless nights gazing up at the stars through portable telescopes.\\r\\nThe oldest recorded tectonic activity in the park is related to the Paleozoic Marathon orogeny, although Proterozoic events (over 550 Mya) possibly have some deep control. The Marathon orogeny (part of the Ouachita-Marathon-Sonora orogenic belt) is part of thrusting of rocks from the South American Plate over the North American Plate. This can be best seen in the Persimmon Gap area of the park. This orogenic event is linked to the lack of Triassic- and Jurassic-age rocks in the park.[3]\\r\\nBetween the Triassic and the Cretaceous, the South American Plate rifted from the North American Plate, resulting in the deposition of the Glen Rose Limestone, Del Carmen Limestone, Sue Peaks Formation, Santa Elena Limestone, Del Rio Clay, Buda Limestone, and Boquillas formations (preserved in the Sierra del CarmenÿSantiago Mountains, Nine Point Mesa, Mariscal Mountain, and Mesa de Anguila areas). Also during this time, the Chihuahua trough formed as the Gulf of Mexico opened, which resulted in east-west striking normal faulting.[3] As a result of this depositional time, dinosaur,[10] forest[11][12] and other fossils are preserved in the park.\\r\\nFollowing the ending of rifting in the Late Cretaceous to the early Cenozoic, the Big Bend area was subjected to the Laramide orogeny. This period of (now east-west) compression caused the northeast-facing Mesa de Anguila (an uplifted monocline on the park's southwest margin), the southwest-facing Sierra del CarmenÿSantiago Mountains (an uplifted and thrust-faulted monocline that forms the park's boundary on the east) and the Tornillo Basin. During the middle Cenozoic, most of the volcanic rocks, including the Chisos group, the Pine Canyon caldera complex, and the Burro Mesa Formation, formed.[3]\\r\\nThe most recent tectonic activity in the park is basin and range faulting from the Neogene to Quaternary. This period of east-west extension has resulted in Estufa and Dehalo bolsons in the Chisos Mountains, as well as the Terlingua and Sierra del Carmen, Chalk Draw, and Burro Mesa faults. The Rio Grande has entered the Big Bend area roughly 2 million years ago, and since then, extensive erosion and downcutting have occurred.[3]\\r\\nCultural resources in the park range from the Paleo-Indian period 10,500 years ago through the historic period represented by Native American groups, such as the Chisos, Mescaleros, and Comanche. More recently, Spanish, Mexican, Anglo, and Irish settlers farmed, ranched, and mined in the area.\\r\\nThroughout the prehistoric period, humans found shelter and maintained open campsites throughout the park. The archeological record reveals an Archaic-period desert culture, whose inhabitants developed a nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle that remained virtually unchanged for several thousand years.\\r\\nThe historic cultural landscape centers upon various subsistence or commercial land uses. The riparian and tributary environments were used for subsistence and irrigation farming. Transportation networks, irrigation structures, simple domestic residences and outbuildings, and planed and terraced farm land lining the stream banks characterize these landscapes.\\r\\nDuring the early historic period (before 1535) several Indian groups were recorded as inhabiting the Big Bend. The Chisos Indians were a loosely organized group of nomadic hunters and gatherers who probably practiced limited agriculture on a seasonal basis. The origin of the Chisos Indians is not known. Linguistically, they were associated with the Conchos Indians of northern Chihuahua and northwestern Coahuila. Their language group spoke a variation of Uto-Aztecan, a language whose speakers ranged from central Mexico to the Great Basin of the U.S.\\r\\nThe Jumano was a nomadic group that traveled and traded throughout West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, but some historic records indicate they were enemies of the Chisos. Around the beginning of the 18th century, the Mescalero Apaches began to invade the Big Bend region and displaced the Chisos Indians. One of the last Native American groups to use the Big Bend was the Comanches, who passed through the park along the Comanche Trail on their way to and from periodic raids into the Mexican interior. These raids continued until the mid-19th century. The last of the great military leaders of the native peoples of the region was an Apache of Spanish ancestry named Alzate, who was active as late as the late 1860s.\\r\\nThe European presence in the region begins circa 1535 AD with the first Spanish explorations into this portion of North America. The expedition of lvar N~?ez Cabeza de Vaca passed near the Big Bend and was followed by other expeditions. Some of these expeditions were searching for gold and silver, or farm and ranch land. Others, such as those by the Franciscan missionaries, were intended to establish centers in which the natives could be evangelized. In an attempt to protect the northern frontier of the New Spain, from which emerged present-day Mexico, a line of presidios, or forts, was established along the Rio Grande in the late 18th century. The Presidio de San Vicente was built near present-day San Vicente, Coahuila, and the Presidio de San Carlos was built near present-day Manuel Benavides, Chihuahua. Some of the presidios were soon abandoned, because of financial difficulties and because they could not effectively stop Indian intrusions into Mexico. The soldiers and settlers of these presidios moved to newer presidios where the interests of the Spanish Empire were more defensible. Such was the case of Santa Rosa Maria del Sacramento, now Muzquiz, Coahuila.\\r\\nVery little study has been made of the Spanish occupation of the Big Bend following the abandonment of the presidios. In 1805, a Spanish settlement called Altares existed 30?mi (48?km) south of the Rio Grande. The region became a part of Mexico when it achieved its independence from Spain in 1821. Mexican families lived in the area when English-speaking settlers began arriving following the secession of Texas during the latter half of the 19th century.\\r\\nFollowing the end of the MexicanÿAmerican War in 1848, the U.S. Army made military surveys of the uncharted land of the Big Bend. Forts and outposts were established across Trans-Pecos Texas to protect migrating settlers from Indian attacks. A significant proportion of the soldiers in the late 1800s were African American and came to be called the \\"buffalo soldiers\\", a name apparently given to them by the Native Americans. Lieutenant Henry Flipper, the first American of African ancestry to graduate from West Point, served in Shafter, Texas, near the end of the 19th century. (Shafter, named for General William R. Shafter, lies west of the Big Bend along the highway from Presidio to Marfa.) Ranchers began to settle in the Big Bend about 1880, and by 1900, sheep, goat, and cattle ranches occupied most of the area. The delicate desert environment was soon overgrazed.\\r\\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, valuable mineral deposits were discovered and brought settlers who worked in the mines or supported the mines by farming or by cutting timber for the mines and smelters. Communities sprang up around the mines. Boquillas and Terlingua both resulted from mining operations. During this period, the Rio Grande flood plain was settled by farmers. Settlements developed with names like Terlingua Abajo, San Vicente, La Coyota, and Castolon. Often, no more than clusters of families were living and farming in the same area, and they were successful only to the degree that the land was able to support them.\\r\\nIn the 1930s, many people who loved the Big Bend country saw that it was a land of unique contrast and beauty that was worth preserving for future generations. In 1933, the Texas Legislature passed legislation to establish Texas Canyons State Park. Later that year, the park was redesignated Big Bend State Park. In 1935, the United States Congress passed legislation that would enable the acquisition of the land for a national park[13]. The State of Texas deeded the land that it had acquired to the federal government, and on June 12, 1944, Big Bend National Park became a reality. The park opened to visitors on July 1, 1944.\\r\\nDespite its harsh desert environment, Big Bend has more than 1,200 species of plants (including 60 cactus species), over 600 species of vertebrates, and about 3,600 insect species. The variety of life is largely due to the diverse ecology and changes in elevation between the dry, hot desert, the cool mountains, and the fertile river valley.\\r\\nMost of the animals are not visible in the day, particularly in the desert. The park comes alive at night, with many of the animals foraging for food. About 150 cougar (Puma concolor) sightings are reported per year, despite the fact that only two dozen cougars live in the park.[14] Other species that inhabit the park include coyote (Canis latrans), kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spp.), greater roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), gray fox (Urycon cinereoargenteus), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), and black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus). Mexican black bears (Ursus americanus eremicus) are also present in the mountain areas.\\r\\nThe variety of cactus and other plant life add color to the Big Bend region. Cactus species in the park include prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), claretcup (Echinocereus coccineus), and pitaya (E. enneacanthus). In the spring, the wildflowers are in full bloom and the yucca flowers display bright colors. Bluebonnets (Lupinus spp.) are prevalent in Big Bend, and white and pink bluebonnets are sometimes visible by the road. Other flowering plants such as the desert marigold (Baileya multiradiata), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), rock nettle (Eucnide urens), and lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla) abound in Big Bend.\\r\\nThe first U.S. record of the northern tufted flycatcher (Mitrephanes phaeocercus), a Central American species, was from this site in November 1991. Birders also flock to the park, as it is home to the only area in the United States within the breeding range of the Colima warbler (Vermivora crissalis).\\r\\nPlans to reintroduce the Mexican wolf to Big Bend National Park were rejected in the late 1980s by the state of Texas. Disagreement over the reintroduction included the question of whether the park contained enough prey animals, such as deer and javelinas, to sustain a wolf population.[15]\\r\\nBig Bend is one of the largest, most remote, and one of the least-visited national parks in the contiguous United States. In the 10 year period from 2007 to 2016, an average of about 352,000 visitors entered the park annually.[2]\\r\\nBig Bend's primary attraction is its hiking and backpacking trails. Particularly notable among these are the Chimneys Trail, which visits a rock formation in the desert; the Marufo Vega trail, a loop trail that passes through scenic canyons on the way to and from the Rio Grande; the South Rim trail which circles the high mountains of the Chisos; and the Outer Mountain Loop trail in the Chisos, which incorporates parts of the South Rim loop, descends into the desert along the Dodson Trail, and then returns to the Chisos Basin, completing a 30-mile loop. Other notable locations include Santa Elena Canyon, Grapevine Hills, and the Mule Ears, two imposing rock towers in the middle of the desert. Professional backpacking guide services provide trips in the park.\\r\\nThe park administers 118 miles (190?km) of the Rio Grande for recreational use. Professional river outfitters provide tours of the river. Use of a personal boat is permitted, but a free river float permit is required. In June 2009, the Department of Homeland Security began treating all float trips as trips that had left the country and required participants to have an acceptable form of identification such as a passport to re-enter the country.[16]\\r\\nVisitors often cross the Rio Grande to visit the Mexican village of Boquillas. The Department of Homeland Security closed the border crossing in 2002 due to increased security following the September 11 attacks, but in April 2013, the Boquillas crossing reopened as an official Class B Port of Entry between the U.S. and Mexico. It is open Wednesday through Sunday between 9 am and 6 pm.[17][18][19]\\r\\nWith more than 450 species of birds recorded in the park, a widely popular activity is birdwatching. Many species stop in the park during their annual migrations.\\r\\nFive paved roads are in Big Bend. Persimmon Gap to Panther Junction is a 28-mile (45?km) road from the north entrance of the park to park headquarters at Panther Junction. Panther Junction to Rio Grande Village is a 21-mile (34?km) road that descends 2,000 feet (610?m) from the park headquarters to the Rio Grande. Maverick Entrance Station to Panther Junction is a 23-mile (37?km) route from the western entrance of the park to the park headquarters. Chisos Basin Road is 6 miles (10?km) long and climbs to 5,679 feet (1,731?m) above sea level at Panther Pass before descending into the Chisos Basin. The 30-mile (48?km) Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive leads to the Castolon Historic District and Santa Elena Canyon.\\r\\nOcotillo\\r\\nLizard blending in with a rock formation\\r\\nSunset from Boquillas Canyon\\r\\nCasa Grande, an iconic rock formation\\r\\nBoquillas canyon during a lightning storm","input":"Where is the big bend national park located?"},{"output":"outer continental shelf","context":"The frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus anguineus) is one of two extant species of shark in the family Chlamydoselachidae, with a wide but patchy distribution in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This species is found over the outer continental shelf and upper continental slope, generally near the bottom, though there is evidence of substantial upward movements. It has been caught as deep as 1,570?m (5,150?ft), although it is uncommon below 1,200?m (3,900?ft).[2] In Suruga Bay, Japan, it is most common at depths of 50ÿ200?m (160ÿ660?ft). Exhibiting several primitive features, the frilled shark has often been termed a living fossil. It reaches a length of 2?m (6.6?ft) and has a dark brown, eel-like body with the dorsal, pelvic, and anal fins placed far back. Its common name comes from the frilly or fringed appearance of its six pairs of gill slits, with the first pair meeting across the throat.\\r\\nSeldom observed, the frilled shark may capture prey by bending its body and lunging forward like a snake. The long, extremely flexible jaws enable it to swallow prey whole, while its many rows of small, needle-like teeth make it difficult for the prey to escape. It feeds mainly on cephalopods, as well as bony fishes and other sharks. This species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos emerge from their egg capsules inside the mother's uterus, where they survive primarily on yolk. The gestation period may be as long as three and a half years, the longest of any vertebrate. Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen, and there is no distinct breeding season. Frilled sharks are occasional bycatch in commercial fisheries, but have little economic value.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frilled shark was first scientifically recognized by German ichthyologist Ludwig D?derlein, who visited Japan between 1879 and 1881 and brought two specimens to Vienna. However, his manuscript describing the species was lost, so the first description of the frilled shark was authored by American zoologist Samuel Garman, working from a 1.5-metre (4?ft 11?in)-long female caught from Sagami Bay in Japan. His account, \\"An Extraordinary Shark\\", was published in an 1884 volume of Proceedings of the Essex Institute.[3][4] Garman placed the new species in its own genus and family, and gave it the name Chlamydoselachus anguineus from the Greek chlamy (frill) and selachus (shark), and the Latin anguineus for \\"eel-like\\".[5] Other common names for this species include frill shark, lizard shark, scaffold shark, and silk shark.[1][6]\\r\\nSeveral early authors believed the frilled shark to be a living representative of otherwise long-extinct groups of elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and their ancestors), based on its multiple-pointed teeth, the articulation of its upper jaw directly to the cranium behind the eyes (called \\"amphistyly\\"), and its \\"notochord-like\\" spinal column with indistinct vertebrae.[7] Garman proposed that it was allied with the cladodonts, a now-obsolete taxonomic grouping containing forms that thrived during the Palaeozoic era, such as Cladoselache from the Devonian period (416ÿ359 Mya). His contemporaries Theodore Gill and Edward Drinker Cope suggested it was instead related to the hybodonts, which were the dominant sharks during the Mesozoic era. Cope went as far as to assign this species to the fossil genus Didymodus.[8][9]\\r\\nMore recent investigations have found the similarities between the frilled shark and extinct groups may have been overstated or misinterpreted, and this shark exhibits a number of skeletal and muscular traits that firmly place it with the neoselachians (modern sharks and rays), and more specifically with the cow sharks in the order Hexanchiformes (though systematist Shigeru Shirai has proposed that it be placed in its own order, Chlamydoselachiformes).[7][9] Nevertheless, the frilled shark belongs to one of the oldest still-extant shark lineages, dating back to at least the Late Cretaceous (about 95 Mya) and possibly to the Late Jurassic (150 Mya).[10] Because of their ancient ancestry and primitive characteristics, the frilled shark and other members of this lineage have been described as a living fossil.[4] However, the frilled shark itself is a relatively recent species, with the earliest known fossil teeth belonging to this species dating to the early Pleistocene epoch.[11]\\r\\nRather uncommon, the frilled shark has been recorded from a number of widely scattered locations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs off northern Norway, northern Scotland, and western Ireland, from France to Morocco including Madeira, and off Mauritania.[12] In the central Atlantic, it has been caught at several locations along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, from north of the Azores to the Rio Grande Rise off southern Brazil, as well as over the Vavilov Ridge off West Africa. In the western Atlantic, it has been reported from waters off New England, Georgia, and Suriname.[13][14][15] In the western Pacific, it is known from southeastern Honshu, Japan, to Taiwan, off New South Wales and Tasmania in Australia, and around New Zealand. In the central and eastern Pacific, it has been found off Hawaii, California, and northern Chile.[1][12] The frilled sharks off southern Africa were described as a different species, C. africana, in 2009.[15]\\r\\nThe frilled shark inhabits the outer continental shelf and upper to middle continental slope, seeming to favor upwellings and other biologically productive areas.[5] Though it has been caught from a depth of 1,570?m (5,150?ft), it usually does not occur deeper than 1,000?m (3,300?ft).[1][6] In Suruga Bay, it is most common at a depth of 50ÿ200?m (160ÿ660?ft), except from August to November when the temperature at the 100?m (330?ft) water layer exceeds 15?C (59?F) and the sharks shift into deeper water.[16][17] On rare occasions, this species has been seen at the surface.[12] The frilled shark is usually found close to the bottom, with one individual observed swimming over an area of small sand dunes.[1][13] However, its diet suggests that it does make substantial forays upward into open water.[18] This species may make vertical migrations, approaching the surface at night to feed.[5] There is spatial segregation by size and reproductive condition.[17]\\r\\nWith its elongated, eel-like body and strange appearance, the frilled shark has long been likened to the mythical sea serpent. The head is broad and flattened with a short, rounded snout. The nostrils are vertical slits, separated into incurrent and excurrent openings by a leading flap of skin. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval and lack nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The very long jaws are positioned terminally (at the end of the snout), as opposed to the underslung jaws of most sharks. The corners of the mouth are devoid of furrows or folds. The tooth rows are rather widely spaced, numbering 19ÿ28 in the upper jaw and 21ÿ29 in the lower jaw.[3][15] The teeth number around 300 in all; each tooth is small, with three slender, needle-like cusps alternating with two cusplets.[5][18] There are six pairs of long gill slits with a frilly appearance created by the extended tips of the gill filaments, giving this shark its name. The first pair of gill slits meet across the throat, forming a collar.[3]\\r\\nThe pectoral fins are short and rounded. The single, small dorsal fin is positioned far back on the body, about opposite the anal fin, and has a rounded margin. The pelvic and anal fins are large, broad, and rounded, and also positioned well back on the body. The caudal fin is very long and roughly triangular, without a lower lobe or a ventral notch on the upper lobe. There are a pair of thick skin folds of unknown function running along the belly, separated by a groove.[3] The midsection is relatively longer in females than in males, with the pelvic fins pushed closer to the anal fin.[18][19] The dermal denticles are small and shaped like the tip of a chisel, becoming enlarged and sharp on the dorsal margin of the caudal fin.[3] This species is a uniform dark brown or gray.[5] The frilled shark differs from its southern African relative, C. africana, in having more vertebrae (160ÿ171 vs 147) and more turns in the spiral valve intestine (35ÿ49 versus 26ÿ28), as well as in various proportional measurements such as a longer head and shorter gill slits.[15] The maximum known length is 1.7?m (5.6?ft) for males and 2.0?m (6.6?ft) for females.[5]\\r\\nHighly specialized for life in the deep sea, the frilled shark has a reduced, poorly calcified skeleton and an enormous liver filled with low-density lipids, allowing it to maintain its position in the water column with little effort.[18] It is one of the few sharks with an \\"open\\" lateral line, in which the mechanoreceptive hair cells are positioned in grooves that are directly exposed to the surrounding seawater. This configuration is thought to be basal in sharks and may enhance its sensitivity to the minute movements of its prey.[18][20] Many frilled sharks are found with the tips of their tails missing, probably from predatory attacks by other shark species.[17] Parasites identified from this shark include a tapeworm in the genus Monorygma, the fluke Otodistomum veliporum,[21] and the nematode Mooleptus rabuka.[22]\\r\\nFossils of frilled sharks from the Takatika Grit of the Chatham Islands in New Zealand, dated to the CretaceousÿPaleogene boundary, were found together with those of birds and conifer cones, which suggests that the sharks lived in shallow waters at that time. Previous research on other Chlamydoselachus species has shown that individuals living in shallower water had larger and stronger teeth for eating hard-shelled invertebrates. It has been hypothesized that frilled sharks, surviving the mass extinction of the K-T boundary event, were able to make use of vacated niches in shallow water and on continental shelves, the latter opening up a move to the deep-water habitats they now inhabit. Changing food availability may be reflected in how tooth morphology has shifted to become sharper and inward-pointing to prey on soft-bodied deep-sea animals. From the Late Paleocene to the present, frilled sharks may have been out-competed, restricting them to their current habitats and distribution.[23]\\r\\nThe long jaws of the frilled shark are highly distensible with an extremely wide gape, allowing it to swallow whole prey over one-half its size.[5] However, the length and articulation of its jaws means that it cannot deliver as strong a bite as more conventionally built sharks.[24] Most captured individuals are found with no or barely identifiable stomach contents, suggesting a fast digestion rate and/or long intervals between feedings.[16] This species preys on cephalopods, bony fishes, and smaller sharks.[5] One 1.6?m (5.2?ft) long individual, caught off Chshi, was found to have swallowed a 590?g (1.30?lb) Japanese catshark (Apristurus japonicus).[18] Squid comprise some 60% of the diet of sharks in Suruga Bay; this includes not only slow-moving, deep-dwelling types, such as Chiroteuthis and Histioteuthis, but also relatively large, powerful swimmers of the open ocean, such as Onychoteuthis, Sthenoteuthis, and Todarodes.[16]\\r\\nHow the ostensibly weak-swimming frilled shark captures active, fast-moving squid is a matter of speculation. One possibility is that it takes advantage of injured squid, or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning.[16] Alternatively, it may surprise its prey by curving its body and, bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins, launching a quick strike forward in the manner of a snake. It may also be able to close its gill slits and create negative pressure to suck prey into its mouth.[18] The many small, sharp, recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to squid jigs and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid, particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded. Observations of captive frilled sharks swimming with their mouths open suggest that the small teeth, light against the dark mouth, may even fool squid into attacking and entangling themselves.[15]\\r\\nThe frilled shark is aplacental viviparous; the developing embryos are mainly nourished by yolk, though the difference in weight between the egg and the newborn indicates that the mother also provides additional nutrition via unknown means. Adult females have two functional ovaries and one functional uterus, on the right. Unsurprisingly, there is no defined breeding season for either sex, as this shark inhabits depths at which there is little to no seasonal influence.[17] A possible mating aggregation of 15 male and 19 female sharks has been recorded over a seamount on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.[14] The litter size ranges from two to fifteen, with an average of six.[5] Females ovulate eggs into the uterus about once every two weeks; vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and the growth of new ovarian eggs halt during pregnancy, apparently due to insufficient space inside the body cavity.[17]\\r\\nNewly ovulated eggs and early-stage embryos are enclosed in a thin, ellipsoid, golden-brown capsule. When the embryo is 3?cm (1.2?in) long, the head is pointed when seen from above or below, the jaws are barely developed, the external gills have begun to appear, and all the fins are present. The egg capsule is shed when the embryo grows to 6ÿ8?cm (2.4ÿ3.1?in) long, and is expelled from the female's body; at this time the embryo's external gills are fully developed.[17][25] The size of the yolk sac remains mostly constant until around an embryonic length of 40?cm (16?in), whereupon it begins to shrink, mostly or completely disappearing by an embryonic length of 50?cm (20?in). The embryonic growth rate averages 1.4?cm (0.55?in) per month, and therefore the entire gestation period may last three and a half years, far longer than any other vertebrate.[17][18] Newborn sharks measure 40ÿ60?cm (16ÿ24?in) long; males attain sexual maturity at 1.0ÿ1.2?m (3.3ÿ3.9?ft) long, and females at 1.3ÿ1.5?m (4.3ÿ4.9?ft) long.[1]\\r\\nThe frilled shark has seldom been encountered alive, and thus poses no danger to humans (though scientists have accidentally cut themselves examining its teeth).[12] On August 27, 2004, the first observation of this species in its natural habitat was made by the ROV Johnson Sea Link II, on the Blake Plateau off the southeastern United States.[13] On January 21, 2007, a Japanese fisherman discovered a 1.6?m (5.2?ft) long female alive at the surface, perhaps there because of illness or weakness from the warm water. It was brought to Awashima Marine Park in Shizuoka, where it died after a few hours.[26] Garman, and numerous authors since, have advanced the frilled shark as an explanation for sea serpent sightings. Because of the shark's modest size, some zoologists have posited the existence of a giant relative, particularly as larger Chlamydoselachus species are known from the fossil record.[3][4]\\r\\nSmall numbers of frilled sharks are caught incidentally by various deepwater commercial fisheries around the world, using trawls, gillnets, and longlines.[1] In particular, it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets meant for sea bream and gnomefish, and in midwater trawls meant for the shrimp Sergia lucens. Japanese fishermen regard it as a nuisance, as it damages the nets.[17] This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into fishmeal, but is not economically significant. Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has previously listed it as Near Threatened, although the species was downlisted to Least Concern in 2016.[1]\\r\\nIn December 2014, trawler skipper David Guillot caught a 1.5?m (4.9?ft) frilled shark while \\"fishing in water more than 1?km (3,300?ft) deep near Lakes Entrance\\", in Victoria, Australia. The shark was taken to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, where its identification was confirmed.[27]\\r\\nEarly in April 2017, during the filming of a Japanese television variety program in Tokyo Bay, a live specimen of the creature was captured.[28][29]\\r\\nIn August of 2017 a group of scientists caught a 1.5?m (4.9?ft) frilled shark in the waters off of Portim?o, Portugal. The male shark was pulled from a depth of roughly 700?m (2,300?ft).[30][31] On November 14, 2017, researchers reported that another frilled shark was caught near the coast of Portugal.[32]","input":"What ocean zone does the frilled shark live in?"},{"output":"Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n1954\\r\\n\\r\\n2015\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bharat Ratna (Hindi pronunciation:?[b?a?r?t? r?t?n?]; Jewel of India)[1] is the highest civilian award of the Republic of India. Instituted in 1954, the award is conferred \\"in recognition of exceptional service/performance of the highest order\\", without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex.[2][3][4] The award was originally limited to achievements in the arts, literature, science, and public services, but the government expanded the criteria to include \\"any field of human endeavour\\" in December 2011.[5] The recommendations for the Bharat Ratna are made by the Prime Minister to the President, with a maximum of three nominees being awarded per year. Recipients receive a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President and a peepal-leafÿshaped medallion; there is no monetary grant associated with the award. Bharat Ratna recipients rank seventh in the Indian order of precedence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recipients of the Bharat Ratna were politician C. Rajagopalachari, philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and scientist C. V. Raman, who were honoured in 1954. Since then, the award has been bestowed upon 45 individuals, including 12 who were awarded posthumously. The original statutes did not provide for posthumous awards but were amended in January 1955 to permit them. Former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri became the first individual to be honoured posthumously. In 2014, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, then aged 40, became the youngest recipient; while social reformer Dhondo Keshav Karve was awarded on his 100th birthday. Though usually conferred on India-born citizens, the Bharat Ratna has been awarded to one naturalised citizen, Mother Teresa, and to two non-Indians, Pakistan national Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and former South African President Nelson Mandela. On 24 December 2014, the Indian government announced the award to independence activist Madan Mohan Malaviya (posthumously) and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bharat Ratna, along with other personal civil honours, was briefly suspended from July 1977 to January 1980, during the change in the national government; and for a second time from August 1992 to December 1995, when several public-interest litigations challenged the constitutional validity of the awards. In 1992, the government's decision to confer the award posthumously on Subhas Chandra Bose was opposed by those who had refused to accept the fact of his death, including some members of his extended family. Following a 1997 Supreme Court decision, the press communiqu announcing Bose's award was cancelled; it is the only time when the award was announced but not conferred.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral bestowals of the award have met with criticism. The posthumous award for M. G. Ramachandran (1988) was considered to have been aimed at placating the voters for the upcoming assembly election and posthumous awards of Madan Mohan Malaviya (2015) and Vallabhbhai Patel (1991) drew criticism for they died before the award was instituted.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 1954, a press communiqu was released from the office of the secretary to the President announcing the creation of two civilian awardsBharat Ratna, the highest civilian award, and the three-tier Padma Vibhushan, classified into \\"Pahela Warg\\" (Class I), \\"Dusra Warg\\" (Class II), and \\"Tisra Warg\\" (Class III), which rank below the Bharat Ratna.[2] On 15 January 1955, the Padma Vibhushan was reclassified into three different awards; the Padma Vibhushan, the highest of the three, followed by the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Shri.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no formal provision that recipients of the Bharat Ratna should be Indian citizens. It has been awarded to a naturalised Indian citizen, Mother Teresa in 1980, and to two non-Indians, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan of Pakistan in 1987 and the former South African president Nelson Mandela in 1990.[6] Sachin Tendulkar, at the age of 40, became the youngest person and first athlete to receive the honour.[7] In a special ceremony on 18 April 1958, Dhondo Keshav Karve was awarded on his 100th birthday.[8][a] As of 2015, the award has been conferred upon 45 people with 12 posthumous declarations.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe award was briefly suspended twice in its history.[11] The first suspension occurred after Morarji Desai was sworn in as the fourth Prime Minister in 1977. His government withdrew all personal civil honours on 13 July 1977.[12][13] The suspension was rescinded on 25 January 1980, after Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister.[14][15] The civilian awards were suspended again in mid-1992, when two Public-Interest Litigations were filed, one in the Kerala High Court and another in the Madhya Pradesh High Court, challenging the \\"constitutional validity\\" of the awards.[11] The awards were reintroduced by the Supreme Court in December 1995, following the conclusion of the litigation.[13][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bharat Ratna is conferred \\"in recognition of exceptional service/performance of the highest order\\", without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex.[4] The award was originally confined to the arts, literature, science, and public services, as per the 1954 regulations.[2] In December 2011, the rules were changed to include \\"any field of human endeavour\\".[5] The 1954 statutes did not allow posthumous awards, but this was subsequently modified in the January 1955 statute, and Lal Bahadur Shastri became the first recipient to be honoured posthumously in 1966.[3][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there is no formal nomination process, recommendations for the award can only be made by the Prime Minister to the President with a maximum number of three nominees being awarded per year. However, in 1999, four individuals were awarded the honour. The recipient receives a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President and a medallion without any monetary grant. Under the terms of Article 18 (1) of the Constitution,[b] the recipients cannot use the award as a prefix or suffix to their name, although recipients may use either the expressions \\"Awarded Bharat Ratna by the President\\" or \\"Recipient of Bharat Ratna Award\\" to indicate that they have been honoured with the award.[4] The holders of the Bharat Ratna rank seventh in the Indian order of precedence.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with many official announcements, recipients are announced and registered in The Gazette of India, a publication released by the Department of Publication, Ministry of Urban Development used for official government notices; without publication in the Gazette, conferral of the award is not considered official. Recipients whose awards have been revoked or restored, both of which require the authority of the President, are registered in the Gazette. Recipients whose awards have been revoked are required to surrender their medals, and their names are struck from the register.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original 1954 specifications of the award was a circle made of gold 1?3?8 inches (35?mm) in diameter with a centred sun burst design on the obverse side. The text \\"Bharat Ratna\\", in Devanagari Script, is inscribed on the upper edge in silver gilt with a wreath set along on the lower edge. A platinum State Emblem of India was placed in the centre of the reverse side with the national motto, \\"Satyameva Jayate\\" (Truth alone triumphs) in Devanagari Script, inscribed in silver-gilt on the lower edge.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nA year later, the design was modified. The current medal is in the shape of a peepal leaf, approximately 2?5?16 inches (59?mm) long, 1?7?8 inches (48?mm) wide and 1?8 inch (3.2?mm) thick and rimmed in platinum. The embossed sun burst design, made of platinum, on the obverse side of the medal has a diameter of 5?8 inch (16?mm) with rays spreading out from 5?6 inch (21?mm) to 1?2 inch (13?mm) from the center of the Sun. The words \\"Bharat Ratna\\" on the obverse side remained the same as the 1954 design as did the emblem of India and \\"Satyameva Jayate\\" on the reverse side. A 2-inch-wide (51?mm) white ribbon is attached to the medal so it can be worn around the neck.[3][11][20] In 1957, the silver-gilt decoration was changed to burnished bronze.[2][21] The Bharat Ratna medals are produced at Alipore Mint, Kolkata along with the other civilian and military awards like Padma Vibushan, Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri, and Param Veer Chakra.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bharat Ratna has been surrounded by several controversies and multiple Public-Interest Litigations (PIL) had been filed against the conferral of the award.[13][23][24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 January 1992, a press release was published by the President's Secretariat to confer the award posthumously on Subhash Chandra Bose. The decision triggered much criticism and a PIL was filed in the Calcutta High Court to revoke the award.[23] The petitioner took objection to the conferral of the award and its posthumous mention of Bose, saying that honouring a personality higher than the award is \\"ridiculous\\", and it was an act of \\"carelessness\\" to classify such a person with past and future recipients. It said that the award cannot be conferred to Bose posthumously as the Government had not officially accepted his death on 18 August 1945. The petitioner requested the whereabouts of Bose from 18 August 1945 till date, based on the information collected by the 1956 Shah Nawaz Committee and the 1970 Khosla Commission. Bose's family members expressed their unwillingness to accept the award.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo deliver the judgement, the Supreme Court formed a Special Division Bench with Judge Sujata V. Manohar and G. B. Pattanaik. The Solicitor General noted that to confer the award per the appropriate regulations pertaining to the Bharat Ratna, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri, the name of the recipient must be published in The Gazette of India and entered in the recipients register maintained under the direction of the President.[2] It was noted that only an announcement had been made by press communiqu, but the government had not proceeded to confer the award by publishing the name in the Gazette and entering the name in the register. Furthermore, the then presidents, R. Venkataraman (1987ÿ92) and Shankar Dayal Sharma (1992ÿ97), had not conferred a Sanad (certificate) with their signature and seal.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 August 1997, the Supreme Court delivered an order that since the award had not been officially conferred, it cannot be revoked and declared that the press communiqu be treated as cancelled. The court declined to pass any judgement on the posthumous mention of Bose and his death.[27][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, two PILs were filed in the High Courts; one in the Kerala High Court on 13 February 1992 by Balaji Raghavan and another in the Madhya Pradesh High Court (Indore Bench) on 24 August 1992 by Satya Pal Anand. Both petitioners questioned the civilian awards being \\"Titles\\" per an interpretation of Article 18 (1) of the Constitution.[b] On 25 August 1992, the Madhya Pradesh High Court issued a notice temporarily suspending all civilian awards.[13] A Special Division Bench of the Supreme Court was formed comprising five judges; A. M. Ahmadi C. J., Kuldip Singh, B. P. Jeevan Reddy, N. P. Singh, and S. Saghir Ahmad. On 15 December 1995, the Special Division Bench restored the awards and delivered a judgement that the \\"Bharat Ratna and Padma awards are not titles under Article 18 of the Constitution\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the announcement, in November 2013, that C. N. R. Rao and Sachin Tendulkar were to be awarded the Bharat Ratna, multiple PILs were filed challenging the conferring of the award. The PIL filed against Rao declared that other Indian scientists, such as Homi Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai, had contributed more than Rao and his claim of publishing 1400 research papers was \\"physically impossible\\". The suit stated that as Rao had proven cases of plagiarism, he should not be presented with the award but rather should be annulled.[24] The PIL filed against Tendulkar to the Election Commission under the Right to Information Act indicated that the awarding him the Bharat Ratna was a violation of the model code of conduct. The petitioner noted that as Tendulkar was an Indian National Congress nominated Member of Rajya Sabha, the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna would influence the voters of Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Mizoram where the election process was underway at the time.[25] Another PIL was filed against Tendulkar and a few ministers, \\"alleging a conspiracy to ignore\\" an Indian field hockey player Dhyan Chand.\\"[26][c]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 December 2013, the Election Commission rejected the petition stating that conferring the award on people from non-polling states did not amount to a violation of the code.[30] Other High Courts as well rejected the petitions raised against Rao and Tendulkar.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi (1984ÿ89) conferred the Bharat Ratna posthumously on film actor and former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. G. Ramachandran, in a bid to influence voters prior to the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1989.[32][33] The decision was criticised for awarding Ramachandran before independence activist B. R. Ambedkar and Vallabhbhai Patel, who were bestowed the honour in 1990 and 1991 respectively.[34] While Ravi Shankar was accused of lobbying for the award,[35] the decision by Indira Gandhi to posthumously honour K. Kamaraj was considered to have been aimed at placating Tamil voters for the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1977. The seventh Prime Minister V. P. Singh was criticised for posthumously honouring B. R. Ambedkar to please the Dalits.[36][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe posthumous conferments of the award on the recipients who died before the Indian independence in 1947 or the award was instituted in 1954 have been criticised by historians.[37] It was noted that such conferments could lead to more demands to honour people like Maurya Emperor Ashoka,[38] Mughal Emperor Akbar, Maratha Emperor Shivaji, Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore,[39] Hindu spiritualist Swami Vivekananda,[40] and independence activist Bal Gangadhar Tilak.[41] The then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao (1991ÿ96) was criticised for bestowing the award upon Vallabhbhai Patel in 1991, 41 years after his death in 1950; and upon Subhas Chandra Bose in 1992, who went missing since 18 August 1945.[41][42] Similarly in 2015, the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to award Madan Mohan Malaviya, who died in 1946, met with criticism.[41] Janardan Dwivedi, politician of the Indian National Congress, said that Malaviya, who worked predominantly in Varanasi, was \\"deliberately chosen\\" by the Prime Minister Modi, who is the incumbent Member of Parliament from Varanasi.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nA few of the conferments have been criticised for honouring personalities only after they received global recognition.[44] The award for Mother Teresa was announced in 1980, a year after she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Satyajit Ray received an Academy Honorary Award in 1992 followed by the Bharat Ratna the same year.[45][46] In 1999, Amartya Sen was awarded the Bharat Ratna, a year after his 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The award was proposed  by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to President K. R. Narayanan who agreed to the proposal.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough, as per the statutes for the Bharat Ratna, the recommendations for the award can only be made by the Prime Minister to the President,[4] there have been several demands from various political parties to honour their leaders. In January 2008, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader L. K. Advani wrote to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recommending Singh's predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee for the award.[49][50] This was immediately followed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) lobbying for their leader, Jyoti Basu, former Chief Minister of West Bengal.[51] Basu, India's longest-serving chief minister, said that he would decline the honour, even if awarded.[52] Similar demands were made by Telugu Desam Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, and Shiromani Akali Dal for their respective leaders N. T. Rama Rao, Kanshi Ram, and Parkash Singh Badal.[53] In September 2015, regional political party Shiv Sena demanded the award for the independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar stating that he had been \\"deliberately neglected by previous governments\\" but his family clarified that they are not making such demand and that the freedom fighter is known for his contribution towards independence movement and did not need an award for recognition.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nPer the original statutes, sportspersons were not eligible for the Bharat Ratna; however, a revision of the rules in December 2011 made eligible \\"any field of human endeavour\\".[5] Subsequently, several sportspersons' names were discussed; among the most talked-about of these was field-hockey player Dhyan Chand, who was recommended multiple times for the posthumous honour.[55] In 2011, 82 members of parliament recommended Chand's name for the award to the Prime Minister's Office. In January 2012, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports forwarded his name again, this time along with 2008 Summer Olympics gold medallist shooter Abhinav Bindra and mountaineer Tenzing Norgay.[56] Bindra had earlier been recommended for the award in May 2013 by the National Rifle Association of India.[57] In July 2013, the ministry again recommended Dhyan Chand.[56][58] However, in November 2013, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar became the first sports-person to receive the honour and this garnered much criticism for the government.[7][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nA PIL was filed in the Karnataka High Court where in the petitioner requested the court to issue a direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs to consider their representation dated 26 October 2012 and confer the Bharat Ratna upon Mahatma Gandhi. On 27 January 2014, a counsel appearing for the petitioner noted that after multiple representations from the petitioner, they were provided with the information under RTI that the recommendations to confer the award on Gandhi have been received multiple times in the past and were forwarded to the Prime Minister's Office. A Division bench comprising Chief Justice D.H. Waghela and Justice B.V. Nagarathna dismissed the petition stating that the subject is not amenable to any adjudication process and the nominations and conferment process is stated to be informal and in the discretion of the highest authority in the Government.[60][61]","input":"The first foreigner to receive bharat ratna was?"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},x={class:"card-container"};function B(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",x,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(I,[["render",B]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/31.md","filePath":"qapage/31.md"}'),H={name:"qapage/31.md"},N=Object.assign(H,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{F as __pageData,N as default};
