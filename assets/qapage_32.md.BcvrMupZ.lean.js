Between 10:05 and 10:15?p.m. PDT, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, fired more than 1,100 rounds from his suite on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel. About an hour after he fired his last shot into the crowd, he was found dead in his room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His motive remains unknown.\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States. It reignited the debate about gun laws in the U.S., with attention focused on bump fire stocks, which Paddock used to fire semi-automatic rifles at a rate similar to that of a fully automatic weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Strip is a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard immediately south of the city of Las Vegas in Clark County, Nevada. The Strip is known for its concentration of casinos and resort hotels, including the 43-story Mandalay Bay southwest of its intersection with Mandalay Bay Road, in the unincorporated town of Paradise.[2]\\r\\nLas Vegas Village, a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) lot used for outdoor performances, is located diagonally across the intersection to the northeast.[2][3] From 2014 onward, the venue hosted the annual Route 91 Harvest country music festival. The 2017 festival ran from September 29 to October 1, with over 22,000 attendees on the final day.[3][4][a]\\r\\nStephen Paddock was a 64-year-old former auditor and real estate businessman who had been living 80 miles (130?km) northeast of Las Vegas in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada.[5] Paddock was twice divorced, had a long-term girlfriend, and had no known children.[6] He was a son of Benjamin Paddock, a bank robber who was on the FBI's most-wanted list between 1969 and 1977.[6] Paddock's only recorded interactions with law enforcement were traffic citations.[7]\\r\\nPaddock was a high-stakes gambler who placed bets at a high enough level to earn valuable compsfree benefits such as rooms and meals.[8] He was a familiar figure to casino hosts in Las Vegas, but was not well known among other high-stakes gamblers because he mostly played video poker.[8] He reportedly kept to himself and was a heavy drinker.[9] Paddock had lost a significant amount of his wealth over the previous two years,[10] but had paid off all gambling debts before the shooting.[11]\\r\\nPaddock may have considered attacking other events. He had researched large-scale venues in cities such as Boston since at least May 2017,[11] and had reserved a room overlooking the August 2017 Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, but did not use it.[12] According to his girlfriend, she and Paddock were at the Mandalay Bay during an earlier stay a month before the attack when he repeatedly cased out Las Vegas Village from different windows in their room.[13] From September 17, Paddock stayed at The Ogden in Downtown Las Vegas, which overlooked the open-air Life Is Beautiful festival that ran from September 22 to September 24.[13][4] His internet search terms from mid-September included \\"swat weapons\\", \\"ballistics chart 308\\", \\"SWAT Las Vegas\\", and \\"do police use explosives\\".[13]\\r\\nPaddock arrived at the Mandalay Bay on September 25, 2017. He was booked into Room 32-135, a complimentary room on the 32nd floor.[4][8] Four days later, he also checked into the directly-connected Room 32-134. Both suites overlooked the site of the concert at Las Vegas Village.[4][14][b] Between September 25 and October 1the day of the shootinghe stockpiled an arsenal of weapons, associated equipment and ammunition that included fourteen AR-15 rifles (twelve of which had bump stocks and 100-round magazines), eight AR-10 rifles, a bolt-action rifle, and a revolver. Often with the help of hotel bellhops, he brought five suitcases to his room on September 25, seven on the 26th, two on the 28th, six on the 30th, and two on October 1.[15][13][4] Cell phone records also show that he also made multiple visits to his home in Mesquite. On September 30, he placed \\"Do not disturb\\" signs on the doors of both rooms.[15] Paddock spent much of his time at the Mandalay Bay before the shooting gambling, often at night. He interacted with Mandalay Bay employees more than ten times during his stay, including twice on the day of the shooting; an MGM Resorts International spokesperson said they were all \\"normal in nature\\".[16]\\r\\nThe mass shooting occurred between 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. PDT on October 1, 2017, which was the third and final night of the festival. When the shooting began, country music singer Jason Aldean was giving the closing performance.[17]\\r\\nShortly before 10:00?p.m., hotel security guard Jesus Campos was sent to the 32nd floor to investigate an open-door alert. He attempted to open a door that provided immediate access to the floor, but found that it would not open. After Campos entered the floor, he discovered an L-shaped bracket screwed into the door and door frame, which was responsible for barring the door from opening. After reporting the discovery to his dispatch center, he heard the sound of rapid drilling coming from Room 32-135 and went to investigate the matter. At approximately 10:05, he was hit in the right thigh by one of about 200 bullets that Paddock fired through the door of his suite. After Campos was hit, he took cover in the alcove between Rooms 32-122 and 32-124 and immediately informed the hotel by radio and cellphone that he had been shot, though he believed he had been shot with a BB or pellet gun. At the same time, maintenance worker Stephen Schuck was on the same floor to fix the door that Campos had reported as being barricaded. Campos, who was already injured, encountered Schuck and told him to take cover. Schuck contacted hotel dispatchers over his radio, informed them of the ongoing shooting, and told them to call the police.[4][18][19][20][21] Neither Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department nor MGM Resorts International, the Mandalay Bay's owner, have confirmed when information about the initial shooting was relayed to the police.[22][23][24][25]\\r\\nAfter Paddock used a hammer to break two of the windows in both of his suites,[4] he began shooting through them at 10:05?p.m.[26] He ultimately fired more than 1,100 rifle rounds[27] approximately 490 yards (450?m) into the festival audience.[28][29][30][c] He initially started out with a few single gunshots before firing in prolonged bursts.[4] Many people in the crowd initially mistook the gunfire for fireworks.[31] During the shooting, a security fence hindered concertgoers from fleeing the 15-acre concrete lot.[32] The gunfire continued, with some momentary pauses, over the span of ten minutes and ended by 10:15?p.m.[33][34]\\r\\nIn addition to shooting at the concertgoers, Paddock fired eight bullets at a large jet fuel tank at McCarran International Airport 2,000 feet (600?m) away.[4] Two of those bullets struck the exterior of the tank, with one bullet penetrating the tank. The fuel did not explode because jet fuel is comprised mostly of kerosene, which is unlikely to ignite when struck by a bullet.[35]\\r\\nDuring the shooting, police officers were initially confused whether the shots were coming from the Mandalay Bay, the nearby Luxor hotel, or the festival grounds.[32] There were also multiple false reports of additional shooters at other hotels on the Strip.[36] Officers eventually spotted multiple flashes of gunfire in the middle of the northern side of Mandalay Bay and responded to the hotel. At 10:12?p.m., two officers on the 31st floor reported the sounds of gunfire on the floor above them.[32] When officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17?p.m. and encountered Campos a minute later, he directed them to Paddock's room and helped others evacuate. Campos was then directed to seek medical attention for himself.[19][21]\\r\\nBetween 10:26 and 10:30?p.m., eight additional officers arrived at the 32nd floor; some of those officers manually breached through the door Paddock had screwed shut with the bracket. The gunfire had ceased, and the police moved systematically down the hallway, searching and clearing each room, using a master key that was provided by Campos. At 10:55?p.m., the officers finished evacuating guests. At 11:20?p.m., police breached Room 32-135 with explosives.[4][32][34][37] Paddock was found dead on the floor from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.[38][39] Police then breached Room 32-134; while entering the hotel suite, an officer accidentally fired a three-round burst from his weapon, but the bullets did not hit anyone.[4][40] At 11:27?p.m., officers announced over the police radio that a suspect was down.[34][41]\\r\\nMuch of Las Vegas Boulevard was closed while police SWAT teams combed the venue and neighboring businesses. McCarran International Airport, adjacent to the shooting site, was shut down for several hours.[42] Approximately 300 people entered the airport property as they fled to safety from the shooting.[31] This prompted officials to shut down all four runways. More than 25 flights were rerouted to ensure that no aircraft would be hit by gunfire,[36] while other flights were canceled before airfield operations resumed at 12:40?a.m. on October 2.[43] At approximately 2:45?p.m. PDT on October 2, a state of emergency was declared in Clark County.[44][45]\\r\\nEarly on October 2, Sheriff Lombardo identified the suspect as Stephen Paddock.[46]\\r\\nFifty-eight people were shot to death at the music festival; Paddock's suicide was the only death at the Mandalay Bay Hotel.[47][48][49] The fatalities included 36 women and 22 men.[47] The oldest was 67, the youngest 20.[50] Six were from Nevada, 35 from California, 13 from other states, and four from Canada.[51] The Clark County Coroner's Office determined that all 58 victims died as a result of gunshot wounds.[52] Thirty one of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene, while the rest were pronounced dead at hospitals.[11]\\r\\nAn additional 851 people were injured, 422 of them with gunshot wounds.[24][53] In the aftermath, many victims were transported to area hospitals, which included University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center, and at least one of the six hospitals of Valley Health System.[54][55][56] Sunrise Hospital treated the largest portion of the wounded: 199 patients,[57] 150 of whom arrived within a timespan of about 40 minutes.[58] For reasons that are unclear, most patients were transported to Sunrise, a Level II trauma center. University Medical Center, a nearby Level I trauma center, treated 104 patients.[59] Six victims sought medical treatment in Southern California; UC Irvine Medical Center treated four and Loma Linda University Medical Center treated two.[60]\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States, exceeding the death toll of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, where 49 people were shot and killed.[47][61][62]\\r\\nOn the morning after the shooting, lines to donate blood in Las Vegas stretched for blocks. Wait times were as much as six hours or more.[63] Millions of dollars have also been raised to help victims and their families.[64]\\r\\nNevada Governor Brian Sandoval called the shooting \\"a tragic and heinous act of violence that has shaken the Nevada family\\".[65] Jason Aldean, who was singing when the shooting started, posted his condolences on Instagram and noted all of those working with him at the show had survived the attack.[66]\\r\\nAt a press conference, President Donald Trump described Paddock as \\"a very very sick individual\\", and \\"a demented man, [with] a lot of problems\\". He added, \\"the police department has done such an incredible job, and we'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by\\".[67][68] A White House official talking points memo, distributed to Trump allies, opposed tightening gun control since \\"new laws won't stop a mad man\\", but \\"will curtail the freedoms of law abiding citizens\\".[69] On October 2, Trump issued a proclamation to honor the victims and their families.[70][71] On October 4, Trump visited the shooting victims and first responders.[72]\\r\\nA unity prayer walk and ceremony was held in Las Vegas on October 7 in honor of the dead. Speakers at the ceremony included Vice President Mike Pence and Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman.[73] On the evening of October 15, thousands participated in a commemorative 3 mile walk between Circus Circus and Mandalay Bay.[74]\\r\\nThe annual Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Marathon took place on November 12 and was the largest event to be held in the city since the shooting. The event received a massive amount of security, which included 350 officers, counter-sniper surveillance posts, and a number of barriers composed of dump trucks, buses, and other large vehicles.[75]\\r\\nThe future of the Las Vegas Village site remains undetermined.[76]\\r\\nIn the hours and days after the shooting, false information and fake news about the shooter's identity and motive went viral on social media:\\r\\nGoogle and Facebook were criticized for displaying such false news stories in some of their search results.[80][87][88] The two technology companies were said to have failed in their responsibility of keeping false stories from reaching the public.[89] Facebook later said its algorithms were designed to detect and remove false stories, but failed to work adequately in this instance.[87]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, some media outlets reported that YouTube search results for information about the shooting returned links to conspiracy videos. YouTube stated that it had tweaked its search algorithm to promote news sources which it considered more authoritative.[90][91]\\r\\nSurvivors of the shooting have been accused of being paid actors, with some having received death threats on social media.[92]\\r\\nThe shooting prompted support in the U.S. Congress for assault weapons legislation that would ban bump fire stocks. The National Rifle Association (NRA) came out in favor of administrative bump fire stock regulations.[47] Many Congressional Democrats and some Republicans expressed their support of a prohibition of bump fire stocks.[93] Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a Senate bill that gained 39 Democratic co-sponsors. Two bipartisan bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives. As of November, no Congressional action has been taken. House leaders said the issue of bump fire stock regulation should be decided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which originally approved gun-stocks.[94] On November 6, Massachusetts became the first state to ban the sale, possession, or use of the devices.[95]\\r\\nNine days after the shooting, eighteen Democratic U.S. Senators introduced a bill, the Keep Americans Safe Act, which, if signed into law, would ban gun magazines that hold more than ten rounds of ammunition.[96]\\r\\nStock prices of firearms manufacturers rose the day after the shooting, as has happened after similar incidents. Investors expect gun sales will increase over concerns that such an event could lead to more stringent gun-control legislation and a rush of customers wishing to defend themselves against future attacks.[97][98]\\r\\nAccording to authorities with the Clark County Commissioner, the name \\"1 October\\" was declared the official title for investigations into the mass shooting.[99]\\r\\nInvestigators found hidden surveillance cameras that were placed inside and outside the hotel room, presumably so Paddock could monitor the arrival of others.[100] The cameras were not in record mode.[101] Police said a handwritten note found in the room indicated Paddock had been calculating the distance, wind, and trajectory from his 32nd floor hotel suite to the concertgoers he was targeting on the festival lot.[102][103]\\r\\nAt a press conference on October 4, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo stated there was evidencewhich he declined to discussthat Paddock intended to escape the scene, and that he may have had assistance from an accomplice.[104] Investigators searched Paddock's room and found a \\"bulletproof vest\\" and breathing apparatus, which were survival gear that Paddock never used.[105]\\r\\nThere have been several changes in the official account and timeline of Paddock's shooting of hotel security guard Campos. Police officials described these adjustments as \\"minute changes\\" that are common in complex investigations.[19]\\r\\nIn their first statement about the incident, police officials inaccurately reported that Campos arrived on the scene after Paddock began firing into the crowd. In a second statement, police officials reported, again inaccurately, that Campos was shot six minutes before Paddock began firing into the crowd. That report had been based on a 9:59?p.m. notation in a hotel security log, which in a third statement was determined to have been the time when Campos encountered the barricaded door.[18][20]\\r\\nSheriff Lombardo dismissed allegations that the changing timeline was the result of some kind of conspiracy between the police department, the FBI, and MGM Resorts International saying, \\"Nobody is attempting to hide anything in reference to this investigation. The dynamics and the size of this investigation requires us to go through voluminous amounts of information in order to draw an accurate picture.\\"[18]\\r\\nAlthough the investigation remains ongoing, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department released a preliminary report on the event on January 18, 2018.[4]\\r\\nPolice speculate that Paddock acted alone and have not determined his motive. No links have been identified to any hate groups, terrorist groups or ideologies, and he did not record a reason for his actions. [106]\\r\\nOn February 2, 2018, Douglas Haig, an Arizonan ammunition dealer, was charged in a Nevada federal court with \\"conspiracy to manufacture and sell armor-piercing ammunition without a license\\" after his fingerprints were discovered on unfired armor-piercing ammunition inside Paddock's suite.[107]\\r\\nTwenty-four firearms, a large quantity of ammunition, and numerous high-capacity magazines capable of holding up to 100 rounds apiece were found in the suite.[1][108][109] Fourteen of the firearms were .223-caliber AR-15-type semi-automatic rifles: three manufactured by Colt, two by Daniel Defense, two by FN Herstal, two by LWRC International, two by POF-USA, one with a .223 Wylde chamber by Christensen Arms, one made-to-order by LMT, and one by Noveske. The others were eight .308-caliber AR-10-type rifles, one .308-caliber Ruger American bolt-action rifle, and one .38-caliber Smith & Wesson Model 342 revolver.[1][110][111][112] The AR-15 rifles were fitted with vertical forward grips and bump fire stocks,[1][110] the latter of which allowed for recoil to actuate their triggers at a rate of 90 rounds in 10 seconds.[113] The AR-10 rifles were equipped with various telescopic sights and mounted on bipods.[1][114][115] The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that the firearms found in his hotel room, along with more guns found in his homes, had been legally purchased in Nevada, California, Texas, and Utah.[116] In the month preceding the shooting, he had attempted to purchase tracer ammunition, but the gun dealer he approached did not have the item in stock.[117] He bought tracer ammunition from a private seller at a Phoenix, Arizona gun show.[118]\\r\\nDuring subsequent investigations, ammonium nitrate (often used in improvised explosive devices) was found in the trunk of his Hyundai Tucson SUV, along with 1,600 rounds of ammunition and 50 pounds (23?kg) of Tannerite, a binary explosive used to make explosive targets for gun ranges.[119][120] Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said that while Paddock had \\"nefarious intent\\" with the material, he did not appear to have assembled an explosive device.[117][121]","input":"When did the las vegas shooting take place?"},{"output":"Clingman's Dome","context":"Clingmans Dome (or Clingman's Dome) is a mountain in the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina, in the southeastern United States. At an elevation of 6,643 feet (2,025?m), it is the highest mountain in the Smokies, the highest point in the state of Tennessee, and the highest point along the 2,174-mile (3,499?km) Appalachian Trail. It is also the third highest point in mainland Eastern North America, after the nearby Mount Mitchell (6,684 feet or 2,037 metres) and Mount Craig (6,647 feet or 2,026 metres).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nClingmans Dome has two subpeaks: 6,560-foot (2,000?m) Mount Buckley to the west and 6,400-foot (1,950?m) Mount Love to the east. The headwaters of several substantial streams are located on the slopes of Clingmans Dome, namely Little River on the north slope, and Forney Creek and Noland Creek (both tributaries of the Tuckasegee River) on the south slope. The mountain is located entirely within the Tennessee River watershed.[3]\\r\\nClingmans Dome is protected as part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A paved road connects it to U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road). The 45-foot (14?m) concrete observation tower, built in 1959 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, offers a panoramic view of the mountains. An air quality monitoring station, operated by the Environmental Protection Agency, is the second highest in eastern North America.\\r\\nThe Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest which covers Clingmans Dome occurs only at the highest elevations in the southeastern United States, and has more in common with forests at northern latitudes than with the forests in the adjacent valleys. Clingmans Dome stands prominently above the surrounding terrain, rising nearly 5,000 feet (1,500?m) from base to summit. The forest on and around Clingmans Dome has experienced a large die-off of Fraser fir caused by the non-native insect, balsam woolly adelgid.[3]\\r\\nThe Cherokee name for Clingmans Dome was Kuwa'hi, or \\"mulberry place.\\" According to a Cherokee myth recorded by ethnologist James Mooney in the late 19th century, the mountain was the home of the White Bear, the great chief of all bears, and the location of one of the bears' councilhouses. The enchanted lake of Ataga'hi (\\"Gall Place\\"), the waters of which could cure wounded bears, was believed by the Cherokee to be located somewhere between Clingmans Dome and the headwaters of the Oconaluftee River to the east.[4]\\r\\nIn 1789, an act passed by the North Carolina legislature ceded what is now Tennessee to the federal government. This act fixed a portion of the boundary between the two along the crest of the \\"Great Iron or Smoky Mountains,\\" which would have included the mountain now known as Clingmans Dome.[5]\\r\\nThe mountain was dubbed \\"Smoky Dome\\" by American settlers moving in from other areas. In 1859, the mountain was renamed by Arnold Guyot for compatriot Thomas Lanier Clingman[6] (1812ÿ1897), an American Civil War general who explored the area extensively in the 1850s and then spent many years promoting it. Guyot named the mountain for Clingman because of an argument between Clingman and a professor at the University of North Carolina, Elisha Mitchell, over which mountain was actually the highest in the region. Mitchell contended that a peak by the name of Black Dome (now known as Mount Mitchell) was the highest, while Clingman asserted that Smoky Dome was the true highest peak. Guyot determined that Black Dome was 39 feet (12?m) higher than Smoky Dome.\\r\\nIn the early morning hours of June 12, 1946, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress crashed near the summit of Clingmans Dome, killing all twelve aboard.[7]\\r\\nClingmans Dome is part of a geological formation known as the Copperhill Formation. It consists predominately of massive, coarse-grained metagreywacke and metaconglomerate. The Lower northern flanks of Clingmans Dome are underlain by thick layers of sulfidic, quartz-garnet-muscovite phyllite and schist, which occur within the metagraywackes and metaconglomerates. Adjacent to and south of its summit, thin, southward-dipping, and discontinuous beds of garnetiferous, locally graphitic and sulfidic, metasiltstone occur within the Copperhill Formation.[8]\\r\\nThe Copperhill Formation is part of the greater Ocoee Supergroup, a body of clastic metasedimentary rocks formed 560 million years ago. They unconformably lie upon Precambrian granitic and gneissic rocks. The sediments that originally comprised the Ocoee Supergroup accumulated in a string of narrow, deep-water basins that stretched along the entire southern-central Appalachian margin from Tennessee, North Carolina, to Georgia. These basins were rift basins formed by the rifting of Rodinia.[9][10]\\r\\nThe initial metamorphism of the Ocoee Supergroup occurred about 400 million years ago as the result of Ordovician-Silurian tectonism during the Taconic orogeny. Later, Devonian-Mississippian metamorphism of these strata occurred during the Acadian orogeny and additional Pennsylvanian to Permian alteration by retrograde metamorphism and deformation occurred during the Alleghanian orogeny. During the latest part of this orogeny, this segment of the Appalachian Mountains was formed by thrust faulting and folding that uplifted these strata as a series of complexly deformed thrust sheets. During the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, the gradual uplift and erosion of this part of the Appalachian Mountains has continued.[8][9][10]\\r\\nAlthough a dense forest understory covers most of the mountain, outcroppings of the Copperhill Formation can be found on Clingmans Dome at the Forney Ridge Parking Lot at the end of Clingmans Dome Road. This outcrop exposes massive metaconglomerate of the Copperhill Formation. At this outcrop, it consists of massive 6-metre (20?ft) thick beds of micaceous quartzite. It contains coarse pebbles of quartz and feldspar, flat pebbles of fine-grained black graywacke, and egg-shaped concretions up to 30 centimetres (12?in) in diameter. These cobble-size concretions are readily eroded by weathering to leave rust-stained depressions or cavities in the metaconglomerate.[11]\\r\\nSoils of Clingmans Dome are mostly moderately deep to shallow, well drained dark brown loam or sandy loam of strong to extreme acidity; Breakneck and Pullback series are most common.[12]\\r\\nClingmans Dome is the most accessible mountain top in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The 7-mile (11?km) Clingmans Dome Road, which is open annually from April 1 through November 30,[3] begins just past Newfound Gap and leads up the mountain to the Forney Ridge Parking Area, 300 feet (91?m) below the summit. A half-mile (800?m) paved trail leads from the parking lot to the 45-foot (14?m) observation tower at the top of the mountain.[13] The short, steep trail provides a small visitor information center and park store staffed by the Great Smoky Mountains Association, garbage cans, and numerous benches to the side of the path. Vault toilet restrooms are available. The trail offers a glimpse of the often hostile environment of highland Appalachia, passing through the spruce-fir forest and its accompanying blowdowns and dead Fraser Firs.\\r\\nThe Appalachian Trail crosses Clingmans Dome, passing immediately north of the observation tower. A 7.5-mile (12.1?km) leg of the trail connects the mountain with Newfound Gap, and provides the only access to the mountain in winter months. The nearest A.T. backcountry shelters are the Double Spring Gap Shelter, which is 2.6 miles (4.2?km) to the west near the Goshen Prong junction, and the Mount Collins shelter, which is 4 miles (6.4?km) to the east near the A.T.'s Sugarland Mountain Trail junction. Clingmans Dome is the upper terminus for several additional hiking trails, including the Forney Ridge Trail (to Andrews Bald) and the Forney Creek Trail (to the Benton MacKaye Trail on the shores of Fontana Lake).\\r\\nThe western terminus of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail, which connects the Smokies to the Outer Banks of North Carolina, is located atop Clingmans Dome. It follows the Appalachian Trail for 3.8 miles (6.1?km) to the east, where it then begins to descend toward the Blue Ridge Parkway, via the Fork Ridge Trail.\\r\\nBuilt in 1959, the 45-foot (14?m) concrete observation tower features a circular observation platform accessed by a spiral ramp. The ramp is 375 feet (114?m) in length, and rises at a 12 percent grade, in synch with the Clingmans Dome Trail. The platform, 28 feet (8.5?m) in diameter, allows spectators a 360-degree panorama of the surrounding terrain.[15] Cantilevered signs point out the various peaks, ridges, cities, and other features visible in the distance. Depending on the haze, visibility ranges from 20 miles (32?km) on hazy days to 100 miles (160?km) on very clear days.[14]\\r\\nThe tower was one of nine observation towers constructed as part of the \\"Mission 66\\" program (1955ÿ1966), an effort by the National Park Service to upgrade its facilities to accommodate an influx of visitors to national parks during the post-World War II era. Designed by Hubert Bebb of the Gatlinburg-based architecture firm Bebb and Olson, the tower's modern design, especially the use of concrete as the primary building material, marked a departure from previous park structures, which favored more rustic elements. Though some criticized the Clingmans Dome tower as too \\"urban,\\" two other park service observation towers the nearby Look Rock tower along Foothills Parkway and the Shark Valley tower at Everglades National Park were built using similar designs.[14]\\r\\nBebb's original design consisted of a massive stone tower topped by a circular platform and fire observation cab, and accessed by a concrete ramp. Fred Arnold, head of the park service's Forest and Wildlife Protection branch, rejected the inclusion of the fire observation cab, arguing that while Clingmans Dome was the highest point in the park, it wasn't particularly useful for fire detection purposes. Park service director Conrad Wirth objected to the use of a ramp, favoring instead a spiral staircase. After John B. Cabot, head of the park service's Eastern Office of Design and Construction, convinced him of the ramp's usefulness, Wirth decided the stone tower would not be necessary, stating a single central support column would suffice.[14]\\r\\nThe tower was built by the Waynesville-based construction firm of W.C. Norris at a cost of $57,000 (equivalent to $480,000 in 2017). Ground was broken in December 1958.[15] After several weather delays, the tower was completed on October 23, 1959.[14]\\r\\nBase of the helical walkway ramp to the top of the observation tower\\r\\nMountains north of the observation tower obscured by low clouds.\\r\\nClingmans Dome Observation Tower\\r\\nTower access trailhead; large boulders of the Copperhill Fm. on the right.\\r\\nTourists on the steep climb to the observation tower at Clingmans Dome","input":"What is the highest peak in the smokies?"},{"output":"cow's milk","context":"Gouda (English: /?a?d?/?(?listen) or /?u?d?/?(?listen), Dutch pronunciation: [???u?da?]?(?listen);[1][2] Dutch: Goudse kaas, meaning \\"cheese from Gouda\\") is a Dutch yellow cheese made from cow's milk. It is named after the city of Gouda in the Netherlands. It is one of the most popular cheeses worldwide, accounting for 50 to 60% of the world's cheese consumption.[3][dubious ÿ discuss] The name is used today as a general term for a variety of similar cheeses produced in the traditional Dutch manner, as well as the Dutch original.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first mention of Gouda cheese dates from 1184, making it one of the oldest recorded cheeses in the world still made today.[5]\\r\\nThe cheese is named after the Dutch city of Gouda, not because it is produced in or near the city, but because it has historically been traded there. In the Middle Ages, Dutch cities could obtain certain feudal rights which gave them primacy or a total monopoly on certain goods. Within the County of Holland, Gouda acquired market rights on cheese, the sole right to have a market in which the county's farmers could sell their cheese. All the cheeses would be taken to the market square in Gouda to be sold.\\r\\nTeams consisting of the guild of cheese-porters, identified by differently colored straw hats, carried the farmers' cheeses on barrows, which typically weighed about 16?kg. Buyers then sampled the cheeses and negotiated a price using a ritual system called handjeklap in which buyers and sellers clap each other's hands and shout prices. Once a price was agreed upon, the porters would carry the cheese to the weighing house and complete the sale.[6] To this day, farmers from the surrounding region gather in Gouda every Thursday morning between 10:00 am and 12:30 pm from June until August to have their cheeses weighed, tasted, and priced. Today, most Dutch Gouda is produced industrially. However, some 300 Dutch farmers still produce boerenkaas (farmers cheese) which is a protected form of Gouda made in the traditional manner, using unpasteurized milk. Cheesemaking traditionally was a woman's task in Dutch culture, with farmers' wives passing their cheesemaking skills on to their daughters.[citation needed]\\r\\nVarious sources suggest that the term \\"Gouda\\" refers more to a general style of cheesemaking rather than to a specific kind of cheese, pointing to the fact that the taste varies greatly based on age.[7] The seven different categories of Gouda are based on age.[8] Young (and factory-produced) gouda has been described as having a flavor that is \\"lightly fudgy with nuts, but very, very, very mild\\", while the same source describes a more mature farmhouse Gouda as having a \\"lovely fruity tang\\" with a \\"sweet finish\\", that may take on \\"an almost butterscotch flavor\\" if aged over two years.[9]\\r\\nAfter cultured milk is curdled, some of the whey is then drained and water is added. This is called \\"washing the curd\\", and creates a sweeter cheese, as the washing removes some of the lactose, resulting in a reduction of lactic acid produced.[10] About 10% of the mixture is curds, which are pressed into circular molds for several hours. These molds are the essential reason behind its traditional, characteristic shape. The cheese is then soaked in a brine solution, which gives the cheese and its rind a distinctive taste.[11]\\r\\nThe cheese is dried for a few days before being coated with a yellow coating to prevent it from drying out, then it is aged, during which process the cheese changes from semihard to hard. Dutch cheesemakers generally use six gradations to classify the cheese:\\r\\nAs it ages, it develops a caramel sweetness and has a slight crunchiness from cheese crystals, especially in older cheeses.\\r\\nYoung Gouda cheese is typically used on sandwiches, either cold or melted.\\r\\nIn the Netherlands, cubes of Gouda are often eaten as a snack served with Dutch mustard. Older varieties are sometimes topped with sugar or apple syrup. Cubes of old and very old Gouda are eaten alongside strong beers, such as Tripel, Dubbel, or Trappist, or with port wine.\\r\\nThe term \\"Gouda\\" is not restricted to cheese of Dutch origin.[12] However, \\"Boerenkaas\\", \\"Noord-Hollandse Gouda\\", and \\"Gouda Holland\\" are registered in the EU as having Protected Geographical Indication status.[13][14] These cheeses can only be made in the Netherlands and can only use milk produced by Dutch cows.[15][16]","input":"What kind of milk is gouda cheese made from?"},{"output":"the 16th century","context":"The French colonization of the Americas began in the 16th century, and continued on into the following centuries as France established a colonial empire in the Western Hemisphere. France founded colonies in much of eastern North America, on a number of Caribbean islands, and in South America. Most colonies were developed to export products such as fish, rice sugar, and furs.\\r\\nAs they colonized the New World, the French established forts and settlements that would become such cities as Quebec and Montreal in Canada; Detroit, Green Bay, St. Louis, Cape Girardeau, Mobile, Biloxi, Baton Rouge and New Orleans in the United States; and Port-au-Prince, Cap-Ha?tien (founded as Cap-Fran?ais) in Haiti, Cayenne in French Guiana and S?o Lus (founded as Saint-Louis de Maragnan) in Brazil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French first came to the New World as explorers, seeking a route to the Pacific Ocean and wealth. Major French exploration of North America began under the rule of Francis I, King of France. In 1524, Francis sent Italian-born Giovanni da Verrazzano to explore the region between Florida and Newfoundland for a route to the Pacific Ocean. Verrazzano gave the names Francesca and Nova Gallia to that land between New Spain and English Newfoundland, thus promoting French interests.[1]\\r\\nIn 1534, Francis I of France sent Jacques Cartier on the first of three voyages to explore the coast of Newfoundland and the St. Lawrence River. He founded New France by planting a cross on the shore of the Gasp Peninsula. The French subsequently tried to establish several colonies throughout North America that failed, due to weather, disease, or conflict with other European powers. Cartier attempted to create the first permanent European settlement in North America at Cap-Rouge (Quebec City) in 1541 with 400 settlers but the settlement was abandoned the next year after bad weather and attacks from Native Americans in the area. A small group of French troops were left on Parris Island, South Carolina in 1562 to build Charlesfort, but left after a year when they were not resupplied by France. Fort Caroline established in present-day Jacksonville, Florida, in 1564, lasted only a year before being destroyed by the Spanish from St. Augustine. An attempt to settle convicts on Sable Island off Nova Scotia in 1598 failed after a short time. In 1599, a sixteen-person trading post was established in Tadoussac (in present-day Quebec), of which only five men survived the first winter. In 1604[2] Pierre Du Gua de Monts and Samuel de Champlain founded a short-lived French colony, the first in Acadia, on Saint Croix Island, presently part of the state of Maine, which was much plagued by illness, perhaps scurvy. The following year the settlement was moved to Port Royal, located in present-day Nova Scotia.\\r\\nSamuel de Champlain founded Quebec (1608) and explored the Great Lakes. In 1634, Jean Nicolet founded La Baye des Puants (present-day Green Bay), which is one of the oldest permanent European settlements in America. In 1634, Sieur de Laviolette founded Trois-Rivires. In 1642, Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, founded Fort Ville-Marie which is now known as Montreal. Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette founded Sault Sainte Marie (1668) and Saint Ignace (1671) and explored the Mississippi River. At the end of the 17th century, Ren-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle established a network of forts going from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River. Fort Saint Louis was established in Texas in 1685, but was gone by 1688. Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du Dtroit (modern-day Detroit) in 1701 and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville founded La Nouvelle Orlans (New Orleans) in 1718. Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville founded Baton Rouge in 1719.\\r\\n.[3]\\r\\nThe French were eager to explore North America but New France remained largely unpopulated. Due to the lack of women, intermarriages between French and Indians were frequent, giving rise to the Mtis people. Relations between the French and Indians were usually peaceful. As the 19th-century historian Francis Parkman stated:\\r\\n\\"Spanish civilization crushed the Indian; English civilization scorned and neglected him; French civilization embraced and cherished him\\"\\r\\nTo boost the French population, Cardinal Richelieu issued an act declaring that Indians converted to Catholicism were considered as \\"natural Frenchmen\\" by the Ordonnance of 1627:\\r\\n\\"The descendants of the French who are accustomed to this country [New France], together with all the Indians who will be brought to the knowledge of the faith and will profess it, shall be deemed and renowned natural Frenchmen, and as such may come to live in France when they want, and acquire, donate, and succeed and accept donations and legacies, just as true French subjects, without being required to take no letters of declaration of naturalization.\\"[5]\\r\\nLouis XIV also tried to increase the population by sending approximately 800 young women nicknamed the \\"King's Daughters\\". However, the low density of population in New France remained a very persistent problem. At the beginning of the French and Indian War (1754ÿ1763), the British population in North America outnumbered the French 20 to 1. France fought a total of six colonial wars in North America (see the four French and Indian Wars as well as Father Rale's War and Father Le Loutre's War).[6]\\r\\nIn 1562, Charles IX, under the leadership of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny sent Jean Ribault and a group of Huguenot settlers in an attempt to colonize the Atlantic coast and found a colony on a territory which will take the name of the French Florida. They discovered the probe and Port Royal Island, which will be called by Parris Island in South Carolina, on which he built a fort named Charlesfort. The group, led by Ren Goulaine de Laudonnire, moved to the south where they founded the Fort Caroline on the Saint John's river in Florida on June 22, 1564.[7]\\r\\nThis irritated the Spanish who claimed Florida and opposed the Protestant settlers for religious reasons. In 1565, Pedro Menndez de Avils led a group of Spaniards and founded Saint Augustine, 60 kilometers south of Fort Caroline. Fearing a Spanish attack, Ribault planned to move the colony but a storm suddenly destroyed his fleet. On 20 September 1565 the Spaniards, commanded by Menndez de Avils, attacked and massacred all the Fort Caroline occupants including Jean Ribault.[8]\\r\\nThe French interest in Canada focused first on fishing off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. However, at the beginning of the 17th century, France was more interested in fur from North America. The fur trading post of Tadoussac was founded in 1600. Four years later, Champlain made his first trip to Canada in a trade mission for fur. Although he had no formal mandate on this trip, he sketched a map of the St. Lawrence River and in writing, on his return to France, a report entitled Savages[9] (Relation of his stay in a tribe of Montagnais near Tadoussac).\\r\\nChamplain needed to report his findings to Henry IV. He participated in another expedition to New France in the spring of 1604, conducted by Pierre Du Gua de Monts. It helped the foundation of a settlement on Saint Croix Island, the first French settlement in the New World, which would be given up the following winter. The expedition then founded the colony of Port-Royal.\\r\\nIn 1608, Champlain founded a fur post that would become the city of Quebec, which would become the capital of New France. In Quebec, Champlain forged alliances between France and the Huron and Ottawa against their traditional enemies, the Iroquois. Champlain and other French travelers then continued to explore North America, with canoes made from Birch bark, to move quickly through the Great Lakes and their tributaries. In 1634, the Normand explorer Jean Nicolet pushed his exploration to the West up to Wisconsin.[10]\\r\\nFollowing the capitulation of Quebec by the Kirke brothers, the British occupied the city of Quebec and Canada from 1629 to 1632. Samuel de Champlain was taken prisoner and there followed the bankruptcy of the Company of One Hundred Associates. Following the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France took possession of the colony in 1632. The city of Trois-Rivires was founded in 1634. In 1642, the Angevin Jr?me le Royer de la Dauversire founded Ville-Marie (later Montreal) which was at that time, a fort as protection against Iroquois attacks (the first great Iroquois war lasted from 1642 to 1667).\\r\\nDespite this rapid expansion, the colony developed very slowly. The Iroquois wars and diseases were the leading causes of death in the French colony. In 1663 when Louis XIV provided the Royal Government, the population of New France was only 2500 European inhabitants. That year, to increase the population, Louis XIV sent between 800 and 900 'King's Daughters' to become the wives of French settlers. The population of New France reached subsequently 7000 in 1674 and 15000 in 1689.[11][12]\\r\\nFrom 1689 to 1713, the French settlers were faced with almost incessant war during the French and Indian Wars. From 1689 to 1697, they fought the British in the Nine Years' War. The war against the Iroquois continued even after the Treaty of Rijswijk until 1701, when the two parties agreed on peace. Then, the war against the English took over in the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1690 and 1711, Quebec City had successfully resisted the attacks of the English navy and then British army. Nevertheless, the British took advantage of the second war. With the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, France ceded to Britain Acadia (with a population of 1700 people), Newfoundland and Hudson Bay. Under the Sovereign Council, the population of the colony grew faster. However, the population growth was far inferior to that of the British Thirteen Colonies to the south. In the middle of the 18th century, New France accounted for 60,000 people while the British colonies had more than one million people. This placed the colony at a great military disadvantage against the British. The war between the colonies resumed in 1744, lasting until 1748. A final and decisive war began in 1754. The Canadiens and the French were helped by numerous alliances with Native Americans, but they were usually outnumbered on the battlefield.[13]\\r\\nOn May 17, 1673, explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette began exploring the Mississippi River, known to the Sioux as does Tongo, or to the Miami-Illinois as missisipioui (the great river). They reached the mouth of the Arkansas and then up the river, after learning that it flowed into the Gulf of Mexico and not to the California Sea (Pacific Ocean).[14]\\r\\nIn 1682, the Normand Cavelier de la Salle and the Italian Henri de Tonti came down the Mississippi to its Delta. They left from Fort Crevecoeur on the Illinois River, along with 23 French and 18 Native Americans. In April 1682, they arrived at the mouth of the Mississippi; they planted a cross and a column bearing the arms of the king of France. La Salle returned to France and won over the Secretary of State of the Navy to give him the command of Louisiana. He believed that it was close to New Spain by drawing a map on which the Mississippi seemed much further west than its actual rate. He set up a maritime expedition with four ships and 320 emigrants, but it ended in disaster when he failed to find the Mississippi Delta and was killed in 1687.[15]\\r\\nIn 1698, Pierre LeMoyne d'Iberville left La Rochelle and explored the area around the mouth of the Mississippi. He stopped between Isle-aux-Chats (now Cat Island) and Isle Surgeres (renamed Isle-aux-Vascular or Ship Island) on February 13, 1699 and continued his explorations to the mainland, with his brother Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville to Biloxi. He built a precarious fort, called 'Maurepas' (later 'Old Biloxi'), before returning to France. He returned twice in the Gulf of Mexico and established a fort at Mobile in 1702.\\r\\nFrom 1699 to 1702, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville was governor of Louisiana. His brother succeeded him in that post from 1702 to 1713. He was again governor from 1716 to 1724 and again 1733 to 1743. In 1718, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville commanded a French expedition in Louisiana. He founded the city of New Orleans, in homage to Regent Duke of Orleans. The architect Adrian de Pauger drew the orthogonal plane of the Old Square.\\r\\nIn 1718, there were only 700 Europeans in Louisiana. The Mississippi Company arranged for ships to bring 800 more, who landed in Louisiana in 1718, doubling the European population. John Law encouraged Germans, particularly Germans of the Alsatian region who had recently fallen under French rule, and the Swiss to emigrate.\\r\\nPrisoners were set free in Paris in September 1719 onwards, under the condition that they marry prostitutes and go with them to Louisiana. The newly married couples were chained together and taken to the port of embarkation. In May 1720, after complaints from the Mississippi Company and the concessioners about this class of French immigrants, the French government prohibited such deportations. However, there was a third shipment of prisoners in 1721.[16]\\r\\nThe last French and Indian War resulted in the dissolution of New France, with Canada going to Great Britain and Louisiana going to Spain. Only the islands of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon are still in French hands.\\r\\nIn 1802 Spain returned Louisiana to France, but Napoleon sold it to the United States in 1803. The French left many toponyms (Illinois, Vermont, Bayous...) and ethnonyms (Sioux, Coeur d'Alene, Nez Perc...) in North America.\\r\\nA major French settlement lay on the island of Hispaniola, where France established the colony of Saint-Domingue on the western third of the island[17] in 1664. Nicknamed the \\"Pearl of the Antilles\\", Saint-Domingue became the richest colony in the Caribbean due to slave plantation production of sugar cane. It had the highest slave mortality rate in the western hemisphere.[18] A 1791 slave revolt, the only ever successful slave revolt, began the Haitian Revolution, led to freedom for the colony's slaves in 1794 and, a decade later, complete independence for the country, which renamed itself Haiti. France briefly also ruled the eastern portion of the island, which is now the Dominican Republic.\\r\\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, France ruled much of the Lesser Antilles at various times. Islands that came under French rule during part or all of this time include Dominica, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante, Martinique, St. Barthlemy, St. Croix, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Martin, St. Vincent and Tobago. Control of many of these islands was contested between the French, the British and the Dutch; in the case of St. Martin, the island was divided in two, a situation that persists to this day. Great Britain captured some of France's islands during the Seven Years' War[19] and the Napoleonic Wars. Following the latter conflict, France retained control of Guadeloupe, Martinique, Marie-Galante, St. Barthlemy, and its portion of St. Martin; all remain part of France today. Guadeloupe (including Marie-Galante and other nearby islands) and Martinique each is an overseas department of France, while St. Barthlemy and St. Martin each became an overseas collectivity of France in 2007.\\r\\nFrance Antarctique (formerly also spelled France antartique) was a French colony south of the Equator, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which existed between 1555 and 1567, and had control over the coast from Rio de Janeiro to Cabo Frio. The colony quickly became a haven for the Huguenots, and was ultimately destroyed by the Portuguese in 1567. On November 1, 1555, French vice-admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon (1510ÿ1575), a Catholic knight of the Order of Malta, who later would help the Huguenots to find a refuge against persecution, led a small fleet of two ships and 600 soldiers and colonists, and took possession of the small island of Serigipe in the Guanabara Bay, in front of present-day Rio de Janeiro, where they built a fort named Fort Coligny. The fort was named in honor of Gaspard de Coligny (then a Catholic statesman, who about a year later would become a Huguenot), an admiral who supported the expedition and would use the colony in order to protect his co-religionists. To the still largely undeveloped mainland village, Villegaignon gave the name of Henriville, in honour of Henry II, the King of France, who also knew of and approved the expedition, and had provided the fleet for the trip. Villegaignon secured his position by making an alliance with the Tamoio and Tupinamb Indians of the region, who were fighting the Portuguese.\\r\\nUnchallenged by the Portuguese, who initially took little notice of his landing, Villegaignon endeavoured to expand the colony by calling for more colonists in 1556. He sent one of his ships, the Grande Roberge, to Honfleur, entrusted with letters to King Henry II, Gaspard de Coligny and according to some accounts, the Protestant leader John Calvin. After one ship was sent to France to ask for additional support, three ships were financed and prepared by the king of France and put under the command of Sieur De Bois le Comte, a nephew of Villegagnon. They were joined by 14 Calvinists from Geneva, led by Philippe de Corguilleray, including theologians Pierre Richier and Guillaume Chartrier. The new colonists, numbering around 300, included 5 young women to be wed, 10 boys to be trained as translators, as well as 14 Calvinists sent by Calvin, and also Jean de Lry, who would later write an account of the colony. They arrived in March 1557. The relief fleet was composed of: The Petite Roberge, with 80 soldiers and sailors was led by Vice Admiral Sieur De Bois le Comte. The Grande Roberge, with about 120 on board, captained by Sieur de Sainte-Marie dit l'Espine. The Rose, with about 90 people, led by Captain Rose. Doctrinal disputes arose between Villegagnon and the Calvinists, especially in relation to the Eucharist, and in October 1557 the Calvinists were banished from Coligny island as a result. They settled among the Tupinamba until January 1558, when some of them managed to return to France by ship together with Jean de Lry, and five others chose to return to Coligny island where three of them were drowned by Villegagnon for refusing to recant.\\r\\nIn 1560 Mem de S, the new Governor-General of Brazil, received from the Portuguese government the command to expel the French. With a fleet of 26 warships and 2,000 soldiers, on 15 March 1560, he attacked and destroyed Fort Coligny within three days, but was unable to drive off their inhabitants and defenders, because they escaped to the mainland with the help of the Native Brazilians, where they continued to live and to work. Admiral Villegaignon had returned to France in 1558, disgusted with the religious tension that existed between French Protestants and Catholics, who had come also with the second group (see French Wars of Religion). Urged by two influential Jesuit priests who had come to Brazil with Mem de S, named Jos de Anchieta and Manuel da N܇brega, and who had played a big role in pacifying the Tamoios, Mem de S ordered his nephew, Estcio de S to assemble a new attack force. Estcio de S founded the city of Rio de Janeiro on March 1, 1565, and fought the Frenchmen for two more years. Helped by a military reinforcement sent by his uncle, on January 20, 1567, he imposed final defeat on the French forces and decisively expelled them from Brazil, but died a month later from wounds inflicted in the battle. Coligny's and Villegaignon's dream had lasted a mere 12 years.\\r\\nEquinoctial France was the contemporary name given to the colonization efforts of France in the 17th century in South America, around the line of Equator, before \\"tropical\\" had fully gained its modern meaning: Equinoctial means in Latin \\"of equal nights\\", i.e., on the Equator, where the duration of days and nights is nearly the same year round. The French colonial empire in the New World also included New France (Nouvelle France) in North America, particularly in what is today the province of Quebec, Canada, and for a very short period (12 years) also Antarctic France (France Antarctique, in French), in present-day Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All of these settlements were in violation of the papal bull of 1493, which divided the New World between Spain and Portugal. This division was later defined more exactly by the Treaty of Tordesillas.\\r\\nFrance quinoxiale started in 1612, when a French expedition departed from Cancale, Brittany, France, under the command of Daniel de la Touche, Seigneur de la Ravardire, and Fran?ois de Razilly, admiral. Carrying 500 colonists, it arrived in the Northern coast of what is today the Brazilian state of Maranh?o. De la Ravardire had discovered the region in 1604 but the death of the king postponed his plans to start its colonization. The colonists soon founded a village, which was named \\"Saint-Louis\\", in honor of the French king Louis IX. This later became S?o Lus in Portuguese,[1] the only Brazilian state capital founded by France. On 8 September, Capuchin friars prayed the first mass, and the soldiers started building a fortress. An important difference in relation to France Antarctique is that this new colony was not motivated by escape from religious persecutions to Protestants (see French Wars of Religion). The colony did not last long. A Portuguese army assembled in the Captaincy of Pernambuco, under the command of Alexandre de Moura, was able to mount a military expedition, which defeated and expelled the French colonists in 1615, less than four years after their arrival in the land. Thus, it repeated the disaster spelt for the colonists of France Antarctique, in 1567. A few years later, in 1620, Portuguese and Brazilian colonists arrived in number and S?o Lus started to develop, with an economy based mostly in sugar cane and slavery.\\r\\nFrench traders and colonists tried again to settle a France quinoxiale further North, in what is today French Guiana, in 1626, 1635 (when the capital, Cayenne, was founded) and 1643. Twice a Compagnie de la France quinoxiale was founded, in 1643 and 1645, but both foundered as a result of misfortune and mismanagement. It was only after 1674, when the colony came under the direct control of the French crown and a competent Governor took office, that France quinoxiale became a reality. To this day, French Guiana is a department of France.[20]\\r\\nFrench Guiana was first settled by the French in 1604, although its earliest settlements were abandoned in the face of hostilities from the indigenous population and tropical diseases. The settlement of Cayenne was established in 1643, but was abandoned. It was re-established in the 1660s. Except for brief occupations by the English and Dutch in the 17th century, and by the Portuguese in the 19th century, Guiana has remained under French rule ever since. From 1851 to 1951 it was the site of a notorious penal colony, Devil's Island (?le du Diable). Since 1946, French Guiana has been an overseas department of France.[21]","input":"In what century did france establish its first settlement in the americas?"},{"output":"8 million","context":"Edo is a state in Nigeria.

It was formed in June 1963 from Benin and Delta provinces of the Western Region, and its capital was Benin City. It was renamed a province in 1966, and in 1967 when the other provinces were split up into several states, it remained territorially intact, becoming a state.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Nigerian Civil War, the Biafran forces invaded the new Mid-Western state, en route to Lagos, in an attempt to force a quick end to the war. While under Biafran occupation, the state was declared as the Republic of Benin as Nigerian forces were to retake the region. The republic collapsed a day after the declaration as Nigerian troops overtook Benin City. Edo State was formed on August 27, 1991 when Bendel State was split into Edo and Delta States.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Benin City as capital, the population of the entire state is approximately 8 million. It is made up of three major ethnic groups; namely Edo (Binis), Esan and Afemai (Owan/Etsako) with Akoko Edo.  However the State has a high presence of residents from across the country and the world because of its cosmopolitan tendencies. Benin City the capital has a history of being one of the foremost destinations of Europeans during their exploration of Africa continent many centuries ago. Some of the flash points have  remained enviable tourists attraction for the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main ethnic groups in Edo State are: Edos, Afemais, Esans, Owans and Akoko Edos. Virtually all the groups traced their origin to Benin City hence the dialects of the groups vary with their distance from Benin City. The Bini speaking people who occupy seven out of the 18 Local Government Areas of the state constitute 57.54% while others Esan (17.14%) Afemai compirising of Etsako (12.19%), Owan (7.43%), and Akoko Edo (5.70%). However, the Igbira speaking communities exist in Akoko Edo as well as  Ijaw Izons, Urhobos, Itsekiris communities in Ovia North East and South West Local Government Areas especially in the borderlands. Also, Ika speaking communities exist in Igbanke in Orhionmwon LGA.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of communities and indeed the ruling dynasties in all the clans trace their roots to the ancient kingdom of Benin. Cultural similarities are in the areas of religious worships, folk-lore, dances, festivals, traditional modes of dressing, arts and craft. The political pattern and behaviour are based on a situation where both the monarchial and republican ideas flourished in an integrated manner. The colourful traditional festivals in the state manifest its rich cultural heritage. Critical among these are the Igue and Ekaba festivals done among the Binis and manhood initiation (age groups) by the Etsako people. With an estimated population of 3,218, 332 made up of 1,640,461 males and 1, 577, 871 females and a growth rate of 2.7% per annum (NPC, 2006), as well as a total landmass of 19,187 square kilometers, the state has a population density of about 168 persons per square kilometers.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdo State consists of eighteen (18) Local Government Areas. They are:\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish is the official language of the state. The major tribal languages spoken in the state are Igarra, Edo, Etsako/Afemai, Esan and Okpamheri.[3] Edo State is home to several ethnicities, among them the Edo, Okpe, Esan, Afemai/Etsako, Ora, Akoko-Edo, Igbanke, Emai and Ijaw.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTourist attractions in Edo State include the Emotan Statue in Benin City, Ise Lake and River Niger Beach in Agenebode, Etsako-East; Mike Akhigbe Square at fugar, Ambrose Alli Square, Ekpoma, River Niger Beaches at Ilushi, BFFM Building at Ewu, College of Agriculture and Aqua Culture Technology, Agenebode, Okpekpe with its hills and scenes and the  Usomege Hills at Apana-Uzairue, Somorika hills in Akoko Edo, where a government-run tourist center at Ososo is set among spectacular scenery.[4][5]\\r\\nThe state produces crude oil.[6] and other mineral resources like limestone and quarry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Edojobs initiative was launched in 2016 as part of Governor Godwin Obaseki's promise to create 200,000 new jobs in the region.[7]","input":"What is the population of edo state nigeria?"},{"output":"the western Pacific Ocean","context":"Coordinates: 1121N 14212E? / ?11.350N 142.200E? / 11.350; 142.200\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench or Marianas Trench[1] is the deepest part of the world's oceans. It is located in the western Pacific Ocean, an average of 200 kilometres (124?mi) to the east of the Mariana Islands, in the Western Pacific east of Philippines. It is a crescent-shaped scar in the Earth's crust, and measures about 2,550?km (1,580?mi) long and 69?km (43?mi) wide on average. It reaches a maximum-known depth of 10,994 metres (36,070?ft) (I 40 metres [130?ft]) at a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep, at its southern end,[2] although some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at 11,034 metres (36,201?ft).[3] For comparison: if Mount Everest were dropped into the trench at this point, its peak would still be over 2 kilometres (1.2?mi) underwater.[a] In 2009, the Marianas Trench was established as a United States National Monument.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the bottom of the trench the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bars (15,750?psi), more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%, so that 95.27 litres of water under the pressure of the Challenger Deep would contain the same mass as 100 litres at the surface. The temperature at the bottom is 1 to 4?C (34 to 39?F).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the center of the Earth. This is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere; its radius is about 25 kilometres (16?mi) less at the poles than at the equator.[7] As a result, parts of the Arctic Ocean seabed are at least 13 kilometres (8.1?mi) closer to the Earth's center than the Challenger Deep seafloor.\\r\\n\\r\\nXenophyophores have been found in the trench by Scripps Institution of Oceanography researchers at a record depth of 10.6 kilometres (6.6?mi) below the sea surface.[8] On 17 March 2013, researchers from the Scottish Association for Marine Science reported data that suggested microbial life forms thrive within the trench.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is named for the nearby Mariana Islands (in turn named Las Marianas in honor of Spanish Queen Mariana of Austria, widow of Philip IV of Spain). The islands are part of the island arc that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is part of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction system that forms the boundary between two tectonic plates. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the Pacific Plate, is subducted (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller Mariana Plate that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on earth (up to 170 million years old), and is therefore cooler and more dense; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana Plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is the Mariana Trench proper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the Mariana Islands. These volcanic islands are caused by Flux melting of the upper mantle due to release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific Plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trench was first sounded during the Challenger expedition in 1875, using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of 4,475 fathoms (8,184 metres; 26,850 feet).[11] In 1877, a map was published called Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans (\\"Deep map of the Great Ocean\\") by Petermann, which showed a Challenger Tief (\\"Challenger deep\\") at the location of that sounding. In 1899, USS Nero, a converted collier, recorded a depth of 5,269 fathoms (9,636 metres; 31,614 feet).[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1951, Challenger II surveyed the trench using echo sounding, a much more precise and vastly easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition. During this survey, the deepest part of the trench was recorded when the Challenger II measured a depth of 5,960 fathoms (10,900 metres; 35,760 feet) at 1119N 14215E? / ?11.317N 142.250E? / 11.317; 142.250, known as the Challenger Deep.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1957, the Soviet vessel Vityaz reported a depth of 11,034 metres (36,201?ft) at a location dubbed the Mariana Hollow.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1962, the surface ship M.V. Spencer F. Baird recorded a maximum depth of 10,915 metres (35,810?ft) using precision depth gauges.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, the Japanese survey vessel Takuy (r) collected data from the Mariana Trench using a narrow, multi-beam echo sounder; it reported a maximum depth of 10,924 metres (35,840?ft), also reported as 10,920 metres (35,830?ft) I10?m (33?ft).[14] Remotely Operated Vehicle KAIKO reached the deepest area of the Mariana Trench and made the deepest diving record of 10,911 metres (35,797?ft) on March 24, 1995.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring surveys carried out between 1997 and 2001, a spot was found along the Mariana Trench that had depth similar to that of the Challenger Deep, possibly even deeper. It was discovered while scientists from the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology were completing a survey around Guam; they used a sonar mapping system towed behind the research ship to conduct the survey. This new spot was named the HMRG (Hawaii Mapping Research Group) Deep, after the group of scientists who discovered it.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 June 2009, sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water,  mapping aboard the RV Kilo Moana (mothership of the Nereus vehicle), indicated a spot with a depth of 10,971 metres (35,994?ft). The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth across the entire swath (implying that the depth figure is accurate to I 22 metres (72?ft)).[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, it was announced at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting that a US Navy hydrographic ship equipped with a multibeam echosounder conducted a survey which mapped the entire trench to 100 metres (330?ft) resolution.[2] The mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought to be former seamounts.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is a site chosen by researchers at Washington University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2012 for a seismic survey to investigate the subsurface water cycle. Using both ocean-bottom seismometers and hydrophones the scientists are able to map structures as deep as 97 kilometres (60?mi) beneath the surface.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour descents have been achieved. The first was the manned descent by Swiss-designed, Italian-built, United States Navy-owned bathyscaphe Trieste which reached the bottom at 1:06?pm on 23 January 1960, with Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard on board.[13][22] Iron shot was used for ballast, with gasoline for buoyancy.[13] The onboard systems indicated a depth of 11,521 m (37,799?ft), but this was later revised to 10,916 m (35,814?ft).[23] The depth was estimated from a conversion of pressure measured and calculations based on the water density from sea surface to seabed.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was followed by the unmanned ROVs Kaik in 1996 and Nereus in 2009. The first three expeditions directly measured very similar depths of 10,902 to 10,916?m (35,768 to 35,814?ft). The fourth was made by Canadian film director James Cameron in 2012. On 26 March, he reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the submersible vessel Deepsea Challenger.[24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2015, members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oregon State University, and the Coast Guard submerged a hydrophone into the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, the Challenger Deep, never having deployed one past a mile. The titanium-shelled hydrophone was designed to withstand the immense pressure 7 miles under.[27] Although researchers were unable to retrieve the hydrophone until November, the data capacity was full within the first 23 days. After months of analyzing the sounds, the experts were surprised to pick up natural and man-made sounds such as boats, earthquakes, a typhoon, and baleen whales.[28] Due to the mission's success, the researchers announced plans to deploy a second hydrophone in 2017 for an extended period of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  February?2012[update], at least two other teams are planning piloted submarines to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Triton Submarines, a Florida-based company that designs and manufactures private submarines, plans for a crew of three to take 120 minutes to reach the seabed.[29] DOER Marine, a marine technology company based near San Francisco and set up in 1992, plans for a crew of two or three to take 90 minutes to reach the seabed.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expedition conducted in 1960 claimed to have observed, with great surprise because of the high pressure, large creatures living at the bottom, such as a flatfish about 30?cm (12?in) long,[23] and shrimp.[31] According to Piccard, \\"The bottom appeared light and clear, a waste of firm diatomaceous ooze\\".[23] Many marine biologists are now skeptical of the supposed sighting of the flatfish, and it is suggested that the creature may instead have been a sea cucumber.[32][33] During the second expedition, the unmanned vehicle Kaik collected mud samples from the seabed.[34] Tiny organisms were found to be living in those samples.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2011, a research expedition deployed untethered landers, called dropcams, equipped with digital video and lights to explore this region of the deep sea.\\r\\nAmongst many other living organisms, some gigantic single-celled amoebas with a size of more than 10?cm (4?in), belonging to the class of xenophyophores were observed.[35] Xenophyophores are noteworthy for their size, their extreme abundance on the seafloor and their role as hosts for a variety of organisms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2014, a new species of snailfish was discovered at a depth of 8,145?m (26,722?ft), breaking the previous record for the deepest living fish seen on video.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2014 expedition, several new species were filmed including huge crustaceans known as supergiants. Deep-sea gigantism is the process where species grow larger than their shallow water relatives.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2017 an unidentified type of snailfish was filmed at a depth of 8,178 metres (26,800?ft).[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, a research expedition looked at the chemical makeup of crustacean scavengers collected from a range of 7,841ÿ10,250 metres within the trench. Within these organisms, the researchers found extremely elevated concentrations of PCBs, a chemical toxin banned for its environmental harm in the 1970s, concentrated at all depths within the sediment of the trench.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other oceanic trenches, the Mariana Trench has been proposed as a site for nuclear waste disposal,[39][40] in the hope that tectonic plate subduction occurring at the site might eventually push the nuclear waste deep into the Earth's mantle, the second layer of the Earth. However, ocean dumping of nuclear waste is prohibited by international law.[39][40][41] Furthermore, plate subduction zones are associated with very large megathrust earthquakes, the effects of which are unpredictable for the safety of long-term disposal of nuclear wastes within the hadopelagic ecosystem.[40]","input":"What is the deepest oceans in the world?"},{"output":"12th century","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nChauhans of Shakambhari (1160-1206)Mamluk (1206ÿ1289)Khalji (1290ÿ1320)Tughlaqs (1320ÿ1413)Sayyids (1414ÿ51)Lodis (1451ÿ1526)Mughals (1526ÿ1540)Suris (1540-1553)Hindu-Hemu (1553ÿ56)Mughals (1556-1757)\\r\\nMarathas (1757-1803)\\r\\nCompany Rule (1803-1857)British (1857ÿ1947)Government of India(1947ÿPresent)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian capital city of Delhi has a long history, and has been an important political centre of India as the capital of several empires. Much of Delhi's ancient history finds no record and this may be regarded as a lost period of its history. Extensive coverage of Delhi's history begins with the onset of the Delhi Sultanate in the 12th century. Since then, Delhi has been the centre of a succession of mighty empires and powerful kingdoms, making Delhi one of the longest serving Capitals and one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world.[1][2][circular reference] It is considered to be a city built, destroyed and rebuilt several times, as outsiders who successfully invaded the Indian Subcontinent would ransack the existing capital city in Delhi, and those who came to conquer and stay would be so impressed by the city's strategic location as to make it their capital and rebuild it in their own way.[3][4] The core of Delhi's tangible heritage is Hindu, Islamic (spanning over seven centuries of Islamic rule over the city) with expansive British-era architecture in Lutyens' Delhi dating to the British rule in India.\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant prehistoric sites in Delhi include Anangpur (in the Badarpur region), as well as Harappan excavations near Narela and Nand Nagari.[5] References to Delhi's history in ancient literature are based on myths and legends. According to the Hindu epic Mahabharata, a city called Indraprastha, City of the God Indra, was the capital of the Pandavas. There is a strong belief that Purana Qila was built over the site of ancient Indraprastha. Northern Black Polished Ware (c. 700-200 BCE) have been excavated at the site, and pieces of Painted Grey Ware were found on the surface, suggesting an even older settlement, possibly going back to ca. 1000 BCE.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273-236 BCE) was discovered near Sriniwaspuri. Two sandstone pillars inscribed with the edicts of Ashoka were brought to by Firuz Shah Tughluq in the 14th century. The famous Iron pillar near the Qutub Minar was commissioned by the emperor Kumara Gupta I of the Gupta dynasty (320-540 CE) and transplanted to Delhi during the 10th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is popularly said that Delhi was the site for a total of seven different cities between 3000 BCE and the 17th century BCE, although taking smaller towns and strongholds into account, as many as 15 settlements can be identified. All the earlier locations of Delhi fall within an area commonly called the 'Delhi Triangle,' bounded on the south and the west by the Aravalli Range, known as the Delhi Ridge, and to the east by the Yamuna River.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable settlements to have been established in the region include:[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Delhi, referred to as 'Dilli' locally, derived from its historical name Dhili, is an amalgam all of the above. Officially, however, only seven of the above-mentioned settlements are recognised [9] as historical cities with distinct identities and indigenous heritage: Qila Rai Pithora, Mehrauli, Siri, Tughlaqabad, Ferozabad, Dinpanah and Shahjahanabad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest are not officially identified as Cities of Delhi because of some specific reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Indian folklore, Delhi was the site of the magnificent and opulent Indraprastha, capital of the Pandavas in the Indian epic Mahabharata, founded around 3500 BC. It was, one of the five prasthas or \`plains', which included Sonepat, Panipat, Tilpat (near Faridabad), and Baghpat.[15] 16th-century, Persian historian, Firishta, recorded a tradition that Delhi or Dilli was founded by a Raja Dhilu before the Yavana (Greek) invasions. However, it should be noted that the kings then referred to the initial Muslim invaders as Yavanas.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHindu texts state that the city of Delhi used to be referred to in Sanskrit as Hasthinapur, which means \\"elephant-city\\". The name Delhi may be derived from the word 'Dhillika', though there are other theories. According to Satyarth Prakash (1874) of Swami Dayanand, Raja Dhilu (King Dihlu) founded ancient Delhi in 800 BCE.[16] It was the name of the first medieval township of Delhi, located on the southwestern border of the present Delhi, in Mehrauli. This was the first in the series of seven medieval cities. It is also known as Yoginipura, that is, the fortress of the Yoginis (female divinities). It gained importance during the time of Anangpal Tomar. In the 12th century, the city was included in the dominions of Prithviraj Chauhan.\\r\\n\\r\\nPasanaha Chariu of Vibudh Shridhar (VS 1189-1230) an Apabhramsha writer, provides the first reference to the legend of the origin of the name Dhilli for Delhi.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n??????? ???? ???????, ?????? ??? ????? ???|\\r\\n?????? ???????? ????????????, ?? ???? ??? ????????|\\r\\n??? ???????????? ????? ???????, ?????? ????? ?? ?????|\\r\\n\\r\\nTranslation: There are countless villages in Haryana country.

The Prithviraj Raso names the Tomar king Anangpal as the founder of Lal Kot, whose name is inscribed on Iron Pillar of Delhi at Qutb complex, ascribed to Chandra or Chandragupta II.[18] Anangpal Tomar is often described as the founder of Delhi, built the citadel some 10 kilometres from Suraj Kund.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chahamana (Chauhan) kings of Ajmer conquered Lal Kot in 1180 and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora. \\r\\n The Chauhan king Prithviraj III was defeated in 1192 by Muhammad Ghori.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1206, Delhi became the capital of the Delhi Sultanate under the Slave Dynasty. The first Sultan of Delhi, Qutb-ud-din Aybak, was a former slave who rose through the ranks to become a general, a governor and then Sultan of Delhi. Qutb-ud-din started the construction of the Qutub Minar, a recognisable symbol of Delhi, to commemorate his victory but died before its completion. In the Qutb complex he also constructed the Quwwat-al-Islam (might of Islam), which is the earliest extant mosque in India. He was said to have destroyed twenty-seven Jain temples initially housed in the Qutb complex and pillaged exquisitely carved pillars and building material from their debris for this mosque, many of which can still be seen.[19] After the end of the Slave dynasty, a succession of Turkic Central Asian and Afghan dynasties, the Khalji dynasty, the Tughluq dynasty, the Sayyid dynasty and the Lodi dynasty held power in the late medieval period and built a sequence of forts and townships in Delhi.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1398, Timur Lang invaded India on the pretext that the Muslim sultans of Delhi were too tolerant of their Hindu subjects. After defeating the armies of Nasiruddin Mahmud of Tughlaq dynasty, on 15 December 1398, Timur entered Delhi on 18 December 1398, and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins, and over 100,000 war prisoners were killed as well.[21][22] In 1526, following the First Battle of Panipat, Zahiruddin Babur, the former ruler of Fergana, defeated the last Afghan Lodi sultan and founded the Mughal dynasty which ruled from Delhi, Agra and Lahore.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-16th century there was an interruption in the Mughal rule of India as Sher Shah Suri defeated Babur's son Humayun and forced him to flee to Persia. Sher Shah Suri built the sixth city of Delhi, as well as the old fort known as Purana Qila, even though this city was settled since the ancient era. After Sher Shah Suris death in 1545, his son Islam Shah took the reins of north India from Delhi. Islam Shah ruled from Delhi till 1553 when Hindu king Hem Chandra Vikramaditya, also called Hemu, became the Prime Minister and Chief of Army of Adil Shah. Hem Chandra fought and won 22 battles in all against rebels and twice against Akbar's army in Agra and Delhi, without losing any. After defeating Akbar's army on 7 October 1556 at Tughlakabad fort area in Battle of Delhi (1556), Hemu acceded to Delhi throne and established Hindu Raj in North India for a brief period, and was bestowed with the title 'Vikramaditya', at his coronation in Purana Quila, Delhi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third and greatest Mughal emperor, Akbar, moved the capital to Agra, resulting in a decline in the fortunes of Delhi. In the mid-17th century, the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (1628ÿ1658) built the city that sometimes bears his name Shahjahanabad, the seventh city of Delhi that is more commonly known as the old city or old Delhi. This city contains a number of significant architectural features, including the Red Fort (Lal Qila) and the Jama Masjid. The old city served as the capital of the later Mughal Empire from 1638 onwards, when Shah Jahan transferred the capital back from Agra. Aurangzeb (1658ÿ1707) crowned himself as emperor in Delhi in 1658 at the Shalimar garden ('Aizzabad-Bagh) with a second coronation in 1659. After 1680, the Mughal Empire's influence declined rapidly as the Hindu Maratha Empire rose to prominence.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1737, Bajirao I marched towards Delhi with a huge army. The Marathas defeated the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi.[24][25] The Maratha forces sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals. In 1739, the Mughal Empire lost the huge Battle of Karnal in less than three hours against the numerically outnumbered but military superior Persian army led by Nader Shah during his invasion after which he completely sacked and looted Delhi, the Mughal capital, followed by massacre for 2 days, killing over 30,000 civilians and carrying away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne, the Daria-i-Noor, and Koh-i-Noor. Nader eventually agreed to leave the city and India after forcing the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah I to beg him for mercy and granting him the keys of the city and the royal treasury.[26] A treaty signed in 1752 made Marathas the protector of the Mughal throne at Delhi.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAhmad Shah Durrani?invaded?North India?for the fourth time in early 1757. He entered Delhi in January 1757 and kept the Mughal emperor under arrest. In August 1757, the Marathas once again attacked Delhi, decisively defeating Najib-ud-Daula and his Rohilla Afghan army in the Second Battle of Delhi.[28] Thus, the Marathas established full control over the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1803, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the forces of British East India Company defeated the Maratha forces in the Third Battle of Delhi, ending the Maratha rule over the city.[29] As a result, Delhi came under the control of British East India Company.  Between 1836 and 1858, Delhi was a part of what then known as the North-Western Provinces.\\r\\n\\r\\nDelhi passed into the direct control of British Government in 1857 after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The city received significant damage during the 1857 siege. Afterwards, the last titular Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar II was exiled to Rangoon and the remaining Mughal territories were annexed as a part of British India.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalcutta was declared the capital of British India but in 1911 at the Delhi Durbar of 1911, held at the Coronation Park, King George V announced the shifting of the capital back to Delhi. Parts of the old city were New Delhi, a monumental new quarter of the city designed by the British architect Edwin Lutyens to house the government buildings was inaugurated in 1931 after its construction was delayed due to World War I.[30] New Delhi was officially declared as the seat of the Government of India after independence in 1947. During the Partition of India thousands of Hindu and Sikh refugees from West Punjab migrated to Delhi, and subsequently settled in North and West Delhi areas, while Hindus from East Pakistan, settled in the late 1960s at EPDP Colony (EPDP: East Pakistan Displaced Persons) in South Delhi, later named Chittaranjan Park in the 1980s.","input":"When did delhi became an important commercial centre?"},{"output":"16,564","context":"Beaver Dam is a city in Dodge County, Wisconsin, United States, along Beaver Dam Lake and the Beaver Dam River.

The city was named for an old beaver dam located in a stream flowing into Beaver Dam River.[5] The area had also been known as Okwaanim, Chippewa for beaver dam.[6] The community was incorporated as a city on March 18, 1856.[7] That same year the Milwaukee Railroad reached the area, encouraging further growth.\\r\\nBeaver Dam hosted a World War II POW camp called Camp Beaver Dam in the summer of 1944. The camp held 300 German prisoners of war in a tent city encampment where the Wayland Academy field house now stands.[8]\\r\\nBeaver Dam is also home to the Williams Free Library, the first public library in the United States to have open stacks.[citation needed]\\r\\nBeaver Dam is located at 432735N 88509W? / ?43.45972N 88.83583W? / 43.45972; -88.83583 (43.459967, ?88.836066).[9] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 8.17 square miles (21.16?km2), of which, 6.79 square miles (17.59?km2) is land and 1.38 square miles (3.57?km2) is water.[1]\\r\\nSince 1996, the average annual snowfall in Beaver Dam has been 61.9 inches (157?cm).

The word Bible comes from the Greek biblia (books); manuscript comes from Latin manu (hand) and scriptum (written). Biblical manuscripts vary in size from tiny scrolls containing individual verses of the Jewish scriptures (see Tefillin) to huge polyglot codices (multi-lingual books) containing both the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and the New Testament, as well as extracanonical works.\\r\\nThe study of biblical manuscripts is important because handwritten copies of books can contain errors. The science of textual criticism attempts to reconstruct the original text of books, especially those published prior to the invention of the printing press.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Aleppo Codex (c. 920 CE) and Leningrad Codex (c. 1008 CE) were the oldest Hebrew language manuscripts of the Tanakh. In 1947 CE the finding of the Dead Sea scrolls at Qumran pushed the manuscript history of the Tanakh back a millennium from the two earliest complete codices. Before this discovery, the earliest extant manuscripts of the Old Testament were in Greek in manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus. Out of the roughly 800 manuscripts found at Qumran, 220 are from the Tanakh. Every book of the Tanakh is represented except for the Book of Esther; however, most are fragmentary. Notably, there are two scrolls of the Book of Isaiah, one complete (1QIsa), and one around 75% complete (1QIsb). These manuscripts generally date between 150 BCE to 70 CE.[1]\\r\\nThe New Testament has been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work, having over 5,800 complete or fragmented Greek manuscripts, 10,000 Latin manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including Syriac, Slavic, Gothic, Ethiopic, Coptic and Armenian. The dates of these manuscripts range from c. 125 (the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\mathfrak {P}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n52 papyrus, oldest copy of John fragments) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the 15th century.\\r\\nThe difficulty is in the origin of manuscripts. Often, especially in monasteries, a manuscript cache was little more than a former manuscript recycling centre, where imperfect and incomplete copies of manuscripts were stored while the monastery or scriptorium decided what to do with them.[3] There were several options. The first was to simply \\"wash\\" the manuscript and reuse it. Such reused manuscripts were called palimpsests and were very common in the ancient world until the Middle Ages. One notable palimpsest is the Archimedes Palimpsest. If not done within a short period of time after the papyri was made, washing it was less likely since the papyri might deteriorate and thus be unusable. When washing was no longer an option, the second choice was burning. Since the manuscripts contained the words of Christ, they were thought to have had a level of sanctity;[3] burning them was considered more reverent than simply throwing them into a garbage pit, which occasionally happened (as in the case of Oxyrhynchus 840). The third option was to leave them in what has become known as a manuscript gravesite. When scholars come across manuscript caches, such as at Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai (the source of the Codex Sinaiticus), or Saint Sabbas Monastery outside Bethlehem, they are finding not libraries but storehouses of rejected texts[3] sometimes kept in boxes or back shelves in libraries due to space constraints. The texts were unacceptable because of their scribal errors and contain corrections inside the lines,[4] possibly evidence that monastery scribes compared them to a master text. In addition, texts thought to be complete and correct but had deteriorated for heavy usage or had missing folios would also be placed in the caches. Once in a cache, insects and humidity would often contribute to the continued deterioration of the documents.[3]\\r\\nComplete and correctly-copied texts would usually be immediately placed in use and so wore out fairly quickly, which required frequent recopying. Manuscript copying was very costly when it required a scribe's attention for extended periods so a manuscript might be made only when it was commissioned. The size of the parchment, script used, any illustrations (thus raising the effective cost) and whether it was one book or a collection of several would be determined by the one commissioning the work. Stocking extra copies would likely have been considered wasteful and unnecessary since the form and the presentation of a manuscript were typically customized to the aesthetic tastes of the buyer.\\r\\nDue to the prevalence of manuscript caches, scholars today are more likely to find incomplete and sometimes conflicting segments of manuscripts rather than complete and largely consistent works.[3]\\r\\nDistribution of Greek manuscripts by century[5]\\r\\nThe task of copying manuscripts was generally done by scribes who were trained professionals in the arts of writing and bookmaking. Some manuscripts were also proofread, and scholars closely examining a text can sometimes find the original and corrections found in certain manuscripts. In the 6th century, a special room devoted to the practice of manuscript writing and illumination called the scriptorium came into use, typically inside medieval European monasteries. Sometimes a group of scribes would make copies at the same time as one individual read from the text.[6]\\r\\nAn important issue with manuscripts is preservation. The earliest New Testament manuscripts were written on papyrus, made from a reed that grew abundantly in the Nile Delta. This tradition continued as late as the 8th century.[7] Papyrus eventually becomes brittle and deteriorates with age. The dry climate of Egypt allowed some papyrus manuscripts to be partially preserved, but, with the exception of \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\mathfrak {P}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n77, no New Testament papyrus manuscript is complete; many consist only of a single fragmented page.[8] Beginning in the fourth century, parchment (also called vellum) began to be a common medium for New Testament manuscripts.[9] It wasn't until the twelfth century that paper (made from cotton or plant fibers), which was invented in first-century China, began to gain popularity in biblical manuscripts.[10]\\r\\nOf the 476 non-Christian manuscripts dated to the second century, 97% of the manuscripts are in the form of scrolls; however, eight Christian manuscripts are codices. In fact, most New Testament manuscripts are codices. The adaptation of the codex form in non-Christian text did not become dominant until the fourth and fifth centuries, showing a preference for that form amongst early Christians.[11] The considerable length of some New Testament books (such as the Pauline epistles), and the New Testament itself, was not suited to the limited space available on a single scroll; in contrast a codex could be expanded to hundreds of pages.\\r\\nThe handwriting found in New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often written in a distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between uncial script (or majuscule) and minuscule. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the baseline and the cap height, while the minuscule letters had ascenders and descenders that moved past the baseline and cap height. Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.[12]\\r\\nThe earliest manuscripts had negligible punctuation and breathing marks. The manuscripts also lacked word spacing, so words, sentences, and paragraphs would be a continuous string of letters (scriptio continua), often with line breaks in the middle of words. Bookmaking was an expensive endeavor, and one way to reduce the number of pages used was to save space. Another method employed was to abbreviate frequent words, such as the nomina sacra. Yet another method involved the palimpsest, a manuscript which recycled an older manuscript. Scholars using careful examination can sometimes determine what was originally written on the material of a document before it was erased to make way for a new text (for example Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus and the Syriac Sinaiticus).\\r\\nThe original New Testament books did not have titles, section headings, or verse and chapter divisions. These were developed over the years as \\"helps for readers\\". The Eusebian Canons were an early system of division written in the margin of many manuscripts. The Eusebian Canons are a series of tables that grouped parallel stories among the gospels. Starting in the fifth century, subject headings (ٚϫϫ?ϫ) were used.\\r\\nManuscripts became more ornate over the centuries, which developed into a rich illuminated manuscript tradition, including the famous Irish Gospel Books, the Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow.\\r\\nDesiderius Erasmus compiled the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament in 1516, basing his work on several manuscripts because he did not have a single complete work and because each manuscript had small errors. In the 18th century, Johann Jakob Wettstein was one of the first biblical scholars to start cataloging biblical manuscripts. He divided the manuscripts based on the writing used (uncial, minuscule) or format (lectionaries) and based on content (Gospels, Pauline letters, Acts + General epistles, and Revelation). He assigned the uncials letters and minuscules and lectionaries numbers for each grouping of content, which resulted in manuscripts being assigned the same letter or number.[13]\\r\\nFor manuscripts that contained the whole New Testament, such as Codex Alexandrinus (A) and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C), the letters corresponded across content groupings. For significant early manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209 (B), which did not contain Revelation, the letter B was also assigned to a later 10th-century manuscript of Revelation, thus creating confusion. Constantin von Tischendorf found one of the earliest, nearly complete copies of the Bible, Codex Sinaiticus, over a century after Wettstein's cataloging system was introduced. Because he felt the manuscript was so important, Von Tischendorf assigned it the Hebrew letter aleph (?). Eventually enough uncials were found that all the letters in the Latin alphabet had been used, and scholars moved on to first the Greek alphabet, and eventually started reusing characters by adding a superscript. Confusion also existed in the minuscules, where up to seven different manuscripts could have the same number or a single manuscript of the complete New Testament could have 4 different numbers to describe the different content groupings.[14]\\r\\nHermann, Freiherr von Soden published a complex cataloging system for manuscripts in 1902-10.[15] He grouped the manuscripts based on content, assigning them a Greek prefix: Ѵ for the complete New Testament,  for the Gospels, and ϫ for the remaining parts. This grouping was flawed because some manuscripts grouped in Ѵ did not contain Revelation, and many manuscripts grouped in ϫ contained either the general epistles or the Pauline epistles, but not both. After the Greek prefix, Von Soden assigned a numeral that roughly corresponded to a date (for example Ѵ1-Ѵ49 were from before the 10th century, Ѵ150-Ѵ249 for the 11th century). This system proved to be problematic when manuscripts were re-dated, or when more manuscripts were discovered than the number of spaces allocated to a certain century.[16]\\r\\nCaspar Ren Gregory published another cataloging system in 1908 in Die griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments, which is the system still in use today. Gregory divided the manuscripts into four groupings: papyri, uncials, minuscules, and lectionaries. This division is partially arbitrary. The first grouping is based on the physical material (papyrus) used in the manuscripts. The second two divisions are based on script: uncial and minuscule. The last grouping is based on content: lectionary. Most of the papyrus manuscripts and the lectionaries before the year 1000 are written in uncial script. There is some consistency in that the majority of the papyri are very early because parchment began to replace papyrus in the 4th century (although the latest papyri dates to the 8th century). Similarly, the majority of the uncials date to before the 11th century, and the majority of the minuscules to after.[17]\\r\\nGregory assigned the papyri a prefix of P, often written in blackletter script (\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\mathfrak {P}}}\\r\\n\\r\\nn), with a superscript numeral. The uncials were given a prefix of the number 0, and the established letters for the major manuscripts were retained for redundancy (e.g. Codex Claromontanus is assigned both 06 and D). The minuscules were given plain numbers, and the lectionaries were prefixed with l often written in script (?). Kurt Aland continued Gregory's cataloging work through the 1950s and beyond. Because of this, the numbering system is often referred to as \\"Gregory-Aland numbers\\". The most recent manuscripts added to each grouping are \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\mathfrak {P}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n131, 0323, 2928, and ? 2463.[18] Due to the cataloging heritage and because some manuscripts which were initially numbered separately were discovered to be from the same codex, there is some redundancy in the list (i.e. the Magdalen papyrus has both the numbers of \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\mathfrak {P}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n64 and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\mathfrak {P}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n67).[19]\\r\\nThe majority of New Testament textual criticism deals with Greek manuscripts because scholars believe the original books of the New Testament were written in Greek. The text of the New Testament is also found both translated in manuscripts of many different languages (called versions) and quoted in manuscripts of the writings of the Church Fathers. In the critical apparatus of the Novum Testamentum Graece, a series of abbreviations and prefixes designate different language versions (it for Old Latin, lowercase letters for individual Old Latin manuscripts, vg for Vulgate, lat for Latin, sys for Sinaitic Palimpsest, syc for Curetonian Gospels, syp for the Peshitta, co for Coptic, ac for Akhmimic, bo for Bohairic, sa for Sahidic, arm for Armenian, geo for Georgian, got for Gothic, aeth for Ethiopic, and slav for Old Church Slavonic).[20]\\r\\nThe New Testament books appear to have been completed within the 1st century. The original manuscripts of the New Testament books have not survived. The autographs were lost or destroyed a long time ago. What survives are copies of the original. Generally speaking, these copies were made centuries after the originals from other copies rather than from the autograph. Paleography, a science of dating manuscripts by typological analysis of their scripts, is the most precise and objective means known for determining the age of a manuscript. Script groups belong typologically to their generation; and changes can be noted with great accuracy over relatively short periods of time. Dating of manuscript material by a radiocarbon dating test requires that a small part of the material be destroyed in the process.[21] Both radiocarbon and paleographical dating only give a range of possible dates, and it is still debated just how narrow this range might be. Dates established by radiocarbon dating can present a range of 10 to over 100 years. Similarly, dates established by paleography can present a range of 25 to over 125 years.[22]\\r\\nThe earliest manuscript of a New Testament text is a business-card-sized fragment from the Gospel of John, Rylands Library Papyrus P52, which may be as early as the first half of the 2nd century. The first complete copies of single New Testament books appear around 200, and the earliest complete copy of the New Testament, the Codex Sinaiticus dates to the 4th century.[23] The following table

of ancient writing, and textual criticism is the study of manuscripts in order to reconstruct a probable original text.\\r\\nNone of the original documents of the New Testament is extant and the existing copies differ from one another. The textual critic seeks to ascertain from the divergent copies which form of the text should be regarded as most conforming to the original.[26] The New Testament has been preserved in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th-century-CE Alexandrian text-type, the Western text-type, and the Byzantine text-type, which includes over 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very late in the tradition.\\r\\nSince the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no a priori bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament. This is reflected in the Novum Testamentum Graece, which since 2014 corresponds to both the United Bible Society, 5th edition and Nestle-Aland, 28th edition. In textual criticism, eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence. Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the Alexandrian text-type, are the most favored, and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.[27] Modern translations of the New Testament are based on these copies.\\r\\nTextual scholar Bart D. Ehrman writes: \\"It is true, of course, that the New Testament is abundantly attested in the manuscripts produced through the ages, but most of these manuscripts are many centuries removed from the originals, and none of them perfectly accurate. They all contain mistakes - altogether many thousands of mistakes. It is not an easy task to reconstruct the original words of the New Testament....\\"[28] In reference to the textual evidence for the New Testament, Bruce M. Metzger wrote,\\r\\nIn evaluating the significance of these statistics...one should consider, by way of contrast, the number of manuscripts which preserve the text of the ancient classics. Homer's Iliad...is preserved by 457 papyri, 2 uncial manuscripts, and 188 minuscule manuscripts. Among the tragedians the witnesses to Euripides are the most abundant; his extant works are preserved in 54 papyri and 276 parchment manuscripts, almost all of the later dating from the Byzantine period...the time between the composition of the books of the New Testament and the earliest extant copies is relatively brief. Instead of the lapse of a millennium or more, as is the case of not a few classical authors, several papyrus manuscripts of portions of the New Testament are extant which were copies within a century or so after the composition of the original documents.[29][30]\\r\\nBiblical scholar Gary Habermas adds,\\r\\nWhat is usually meant is that the New Testament has far more manuscript evidence from a far earlier period than other classical works. There are just under 6000 NT manuscripts, with copies of most of the NT dating from just 100 years or so after its writing. Classical sources almost always have fewer than 20 copies each and usually date from 700-1400 years after the composition of the work. In this regard, the classics are not as well attested. While this doesn't guarantee truthfulness, it means that it is much easier to reconstruct the New Testament text. Regarding genre, the Gospels are usually taken today to be examples of Roman biographies.[31]\\r\\nEvery year, several New Testament manuscripts handwritten in the original Greek format are discovered. The latest substantial find was in 2008, when 47 new manuscripts were discovered in Albania; at least 17 of them unknown to Western scholars.[32] There has been an estimate of 400,000 variations among all these manuscripts (from the 2nd to 15th century).[33] If you spread those 400,000 variations over 5,600 manuscripts, that comes out to only about 71 variations per manuscript. (400,000 divided by 5,600). And some of these manuscripts are the equivalent of several hundred pages of text, hand-written (see Codex Vaticanus, Codex Alexandrinus, et al.). The number of variants is additionally less significant than may appear since it is a comparison across linguistic boundaries. More important estimates focus on comparing texts within languages. Those variations are considerably fewer. The vast majority of these are accidental errors made by scribes, and are easily identified as such: an omitted word, a duplicate line, a misspelling, a rearrangement of words. Some variations involve apparently intentional changes, which often make more difficult a determination of whether they were corrections from better exemplars, harmonizations between readings, or ideologically motivated.[34] Variants are listed in critical editions of the text, the most important of which is the Novum Testamentum Graece, which is the basis for most modern translations. For over 250 years, Christian scholars have argued that no textual variant affects key Christian doctrine.[35][36]\\r\\nFragments of the Dead Sea scrolls on display at the Archeological Museum, Amman\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\mathfrak {P}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n52 is the oldest known manuscript fragment of the New Testament, containing a portion of the Gospel of John\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\mathfrak {P}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n46 is the earliest (nearly) complete manuscript of the Epistles written by Paul in the new testament.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\mathfrak {P}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n45 is a manuscript of Gospels and Acts.

In a 2013 study based on radiocarbon dates, the beginning of the First Dynastythe accession of Hor-Ahawas placed at 3100?BC give or take a century (3218ÿ3035, with 95% confidence).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKnown rulers in the history of Egypt for the First Dynasty are as follows:\\r\\nInformation about this dynasty is derived from a few monuments and other objects bearing royal names, the most important being the Narmer Palette and Narmer Macehead, as well as Den and Qa'a king lists.[6][7][8] No detailed records of the first two dynasties have survived, except for the terse lists on the Palermo Stone. The account in Manetho's Aegyptiaca contradicts both the archeological evidence and the other historical records: Manetho names nine rulers of the First Dynasty, only one of whose names matches the other sources, and offers information for only four of them.[9] Egyptian hieroglyphs were fully developed by then, and their shapes would be used with little change for more than three thousand years.\\r\\nLarge tombs of pharaohs at Abydos and Naqada, in addition to cemeteries at Saqqara and Helwan near Memphis, reveal structures built largely of wood and mud bricks, with some small use of stone for walls and floors. Stone was used in quantity for the manufacture of ornaments, vessels, and occasionally, for statues. Tamarix (\\"tamarisk\\" or \\"salt cedar\\") was used to build boats such as the Abydos boats. One of the most important indigenous woodworking techniques was the fixed mortise and tenon joint. A fixed tenon was made by shaping the end of one timber to fit into a mortise (hole) that is cut into a second timber. A variation of this joint using a free tenon eventually became one of the most important features in Mediterranean and Egyptian shipbuilding. It creates a union between two planks or other components by inserting a separate tenon into a cavity (mortise) of the corresponding size cut into each component.\\"[10]\\r\\nCalcite dish.

For unknown reasons, this practice ended with the conclusion of the dynasty.","input":"Who began the first dynasty of egyptian rulers?"},{"output":"The sixth edition","context":"APA style is a writing style and format for academic documents such as scholarly journal articles and books, and is commonly used for citing sources within the field of social sciences. It is described in the style guide of the American Psychological Association (APA), which is titled the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association. The guidelines were developed to aid reading comprehension in the social and behavioral sciences, for clarity of communication, and for \\"word choice that best reduces bias in language\\".[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAPA style is widely used, either entirely or with modifications, by hundreds of other scientific journals (including medical and other public health journals), in many textbooks, and in academia (for papers written in classes). Along with AMA Style and CSE Style, it is one of the major styles for such work.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe APA got involved in journal publishing in 1923.[3] In 1929, an APA committee had a seven-page writer's guide published in the Psychological Bulletin.[4][5] In 1944, a 32-page guide appeared as an article in the same journal.[3] The first edition of the APA Publication Manual was published in 1952 as a 61-page supplement to the Psychological Bulletin,[6]  marking the beginning of a recognized APA style.[3] In response to the growing complexities of scientific reporting, subsequent editions were released in 1974, 1983, 1994, 2001, and 2009. \\r\\n\\r\\nPrimarily known for the simplicity of its reference citation style, the Manual also established standards for language use that had far-reaching effects.  Particularly influential were the \\"Guidelines for Nonsexist Language in APA Journals,\\" first published as a modification to the 1974 edition, which provided practical alternatives to sexist language then in common usage.[7][8] The guidelines for reducing bias in language have been updated over the years and presently provide practical guidance for writing about race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, and disability status (APA, 2009, pp.?70ÿ77; see also APA, 2009b).[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sixth edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association is the most current. It was released in July 2009 after four years of development. The Publication Manual Revision Task Force of the American Psychological Association established parameters for the revision based on published critique; user comments; commissioned reviews; and input from psychologists, nurses, librarians, business leaders, publishing professionals, and APA governance groups (APA, 2007a, 2007b).[10][11]  To accomplish these revisions, the Task Force appointed working groups of four to nine members in seven areas: bias-free language, ethics, graphics, Journal Article Reporting Standards,[12] references, statistics, and writing style (APA, 2009, pp.?XVIIÿXVIII).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe APA explained the issuing of a new edition only eight years after the fifth edition by pointing to the increased use of online source or online access to academic journals (6th edition, p.?XV). The sixth edition is accompanied by a style website, apastyle.org as well as the APA Style Blog, which answers many common questions from users.\\r\\n\\r\\nSample papers in the first printing of the sixth edition contained errors. APA staff posted all of the corrections online for free in a single document on October 1, 2009, and shortly thereafter alerted users to the existence of the corrections in an APA blog entry.[13] These errors attracted significant attention from the scholarly community and nearly two weeks later, on October 13, 2009, the article \\"Correcting a Style Guide\\" was published in the online newspaper Inside Higher Ed that included interviews with several individuals, one of whom described the errors as \\"egregious\\".[14] All copies of the printing with errors were soon after recalled in 2009 (including those from major retailers such as Amazon.com) and all manuals currently in circulation are unaffected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAPA Style uses an author-date reference citation system in the text with an accompanying reference list. That means that to cite any reference in a paper, the writer should cite the author and year of the work, either by putting both in parentheses separated by a comma (parenthetical citation) or by putting the author in the narrative of the sentence and the year in parentheses (narrative citation). \\r\\nExample narrative citation: Schmidt and Oh (2016) described a fear among the public that the findings of science are not actually real. \\r\\nExample parenthetical citation: In our postfactual era, many members of the public fear that the findings of science are not real (Schmidt & Oh, 2016). \\r\\nIn the APA reference list, the writer should provide the author, year, title, and source of the cited work in an alphabetical list of references. If a reference is not cited in the text, it should not be included in the reference list. The reference format varies slightly depending on the document type (e.g., journal article, edited book chapter, blog post), but broadly speaking always follows the same pattern of author, date, title, source.","input":"What is the most current edition of apa?"},{"output":"retractable","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAT&T Stadium, formerly Cowboys Stadium, is a retractable roof stadium in Arlington, Texas, United States. It serves as the home of the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL) and was completed on May 27, 2009.  It is also the home of the Cotton Bowl Classic.  The facility, owned by the city of Arlington, can also be used for a variety of other activities such as concerts, basketball games, college and high school football contests, soccer matches, rodeos and motocross and Spartan races. It replaced the partially covered Texas Stadium, which served as the Cowboys' home from 1971 through the 2008 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium is sometimes referred to as \\"Jerry World\\" after Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who originally envisioned it as a large entertainment mecca.[16] The stadium seats 80,000,[5] making it the fourth largest stadium in the NFL by seating capacity. The maximum capacity of the stadium with standing room is 105,000.[17] The record attendance for an NFL game was set in 2009 with a crowd of 105,121.[18] The Party Pass (open areas) sections are behind seats in each end zone and on a series of six elevated platforms connected by stairways.[17][19] It also has the world's 24th largest high definition video screen, which hangs from 20-yard line to 20-yard line.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally estimated to cost $650 million, the stadium's current construction cost was $1.15 billion,[21] making it one of the most expensive sports venues ever built. To aid Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones in paying the construction costs of the new stadium, Arlington voters approved the increase of the city's sales tax by 0.5%, the hotel occupancy tax by 2%, and car rental tax by 5%. The City of Arlington provided over $325 million (including interest) in bonds as funding,[21][22] and Jones covered any cost overruns. Also, the NFL provided the Cowboys with an additional $150 million loan, following its policy for facilitating financing for the construction of new stadiums.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nA pair of nearly 300?ft (91?m)-tall arches spans the length of the stadium dome, anchored to the ground at each end. The new stadium also includes \\"more than 3,000 Sony LCD displays throughout the luxury suites, concourses, concession areas and more, offering fans viewing options that extend beyond the action on the field\\".[24] It also houses a center-hung Mitsubishi video display board that was the largest high-definition television screen in the world at the time of their installation.[25] It has since been surpassed in size by the Panasonic \\"Big Hoss\\" video board (218 feet (66 m) wide and 94.6 feet (28.8 m) tall) at Texas Motor Speedway.[26] Glass doors, allowing each end zone to be opened, were designed and constructed by Dallas-based Haley-Greer glass systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe retractable roof was designed by structural engineering firm Walter P Moore and the systems were implemented by mechanization consultants Uni-Systems. The electrification of Cowboys Stadium's retractable roof was developed by VAHLE, Inc.[27]  These Kinetic Architecture fundamentals will be employed in order to create quick conversions of the facility to accommodate a variety of events. When the design was officially unveiled on December?12, 2006, it showed that, from inside the stadium, the roof (membrane installed by K?Post Company of Dallas)[28] will look very similar to the Texas Stadium roof, with its trademark hole. However, it can be covered by the retractable roof panel to protect against the elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe football turf field was built by Hellas Construction. They developed a special SoftTop Convertible Turf System that has 26 interchangeable panels to allow the stadium to host a variety of events from concerts, dirt bike and monster truck rallies to college football, basketball, and soccer games.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Dallas Cowboys Hall of Fame is planned for the Hall of Fame level. The drawings also include a site for a large sculpture northeast of the stadium, close to Randol Mill Road.\\r\\n\\r\\nMayor Robert Cluck claimed to use eminent domain as a last resort but most of the properties refused to sell to the city, indicating that the incentive program was not adequate according to Glenn Sodd, an attorney representing some home owners in the area. Attorney Bob Cohen, who is representing some of the property owners, said the city gave many of his clients little incentive to sell. He said he represents the owners of some rental properties who were counting on that monthly revenue for their retirement and said most homeowners cannot afford to re-build or buy in that area with the incentive package.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is claimed that the stadium uses more electricity than the whole of Liberia.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the stadium had yet to sell naming rights, many fans started referring to the project with various nicknames such as JerryWorld,[38][48][49][50] the \\"Death Star\\",[51] \\"The Palace in Dallas\\" (for which announcer Bob Costas was criticized by the Arlington mayor[52]), \\"Cowboys Cathedral\\",[53] \\"Jerrassic Park\\" and others.[54] There was also a petition by some fans to have the stadium named after longtime Cowboys' coach Tom Landry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 13, 2009, Jerry Jones announced the official name as Cowboys Stadium.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 25, 2013, Jerry Jones announced that the Dallas Cowboys had agreed to grant naming rights to AT&T. The name change from Cowboys Stadium to AT&T Stadium took effect immediately.[55] The sponsorship deal was reported to be worth about $17ÿ19 million per year.[56] Facility Solutions Group installed the \\"AT&T Stadium\\" letters on the top of the stadium. Signage includes two sets of letters 43 feet (13?m) tall stretching 385 feet (117?m). The letters are made of lightweight components and aluminum and are insulated and heated to melt ice and snow.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is AT&T's fourth major sports venue where it holds the naming rights. The others are AT&T Park in San Francisco, AT&T Center in San Antonio, and Jones AT&T Stadium in Lubbock.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuinness World Records was on hand at the September 28, 2009 game against the Carolina Panthers to award certificates to the Chairman of Mitsubishi Electric and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for the World's Largest High-Definition Video Display.[25] For basketball events played in Cowboys Stadium, such as the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, the video board is actually larger than the court. It has since been surpassed in size by the video boards at TIAA Bank Field.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the debut preseason game of Cowboys Stadium on August 21, 2009, a punt by Tennessee Titans punter A. J. Trapasso hit the 175 feet (53.34 m) wide screen above the field. The punt deflected backwards and was ruled in-play until Titans coach Jeff Fisher informed the officials that the punt struck the scoreboard. By rule, the down was replayed. Jerry Jones believes that Trapasso was trying to hit the scoreboard, saying, \\"If you look at how you punt the football, unless you're trying to hit the scoreboard, you punt the ball to get downfield. You certainly want to get some hangtime, but you punt the ball to get downfield, and you sure don't punt the ball down the middle. You punt it off to the side.\\"[58] Whether the screen would affect an opposing team's punting strategy has been debated. For teams with strategies centered on maximizing hang-time, physicist Christopher Moore of Longwood University has shown via computer simulation that well-kicked punts have the potential to hit the screen no matter the field position.[59] Trapasso disputed Jones' suggestion that he was intentionally trying to hit the board, and other NFL punters have suggested that the board may pose a problem for longer hang-time punts. The screen was retrofitted with 16 custom winches using 11,000 feet (3.35?km) of 1.5 inches (3.8?cm) domestic galvanized wire rope from Tway Lifting Products to accomplish the safe, efficient transport of the video board in time to make room for U2's massive set during their 360 Tour, and was moved back down after the concert.[citation needed] The video board is also the primary attachment point for up to 370,000?lb (168 metric tons) of concert and theatrical rigging.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 24, 2013, Cowboys punter Chris Jones became the second player to hit the scoreboard. He conceded a touchdown on the re-kick.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 14, 2010, the stadium hosted the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. With an announced crowd of 108,713, the game became the highest-attended basketball game in history, setting a new Guinness World Record. The East squad prevailed with a 141ÿ139 victory over the West.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nAT&T Stadium, then known as Cowboys Stadium, was the site of the 2009 and 2010 Big 12 Championship Games, the last two held prior to the 2010ÿ13 Big 12 Conference realignment. On December 5, 2009, the Texas Longhorns defeated the Nebraska Cornhuskers 13ÿ12 in the 2009 Big 12 Championship Game, the first to be held in the stadium with attendance announced at 76,211.[67] The following year, on December 4, 2010,  the Oklahoma Sooners and Nebraska Cornhuskers rekindled their rivalry as the Sooners won 23ÿ20 in the final Big 12 Championship game to date and will return starting with the 2017 season. The stadium was scheduled to host the games through the 2013 season, but the realignment of the Big 12 Conference to 10 teams meant they were not allowed to host a championship game because of NCAA rules requiring conferences to have at least 12 teams divided into two divisions in order to stage a championship game.[68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arkansas Razorbacks vs. Texas A&M Aggies football rivalry, which began in 1903, was renewed in 2009 as the Southwest Classic, and was played at Cowboys Stadium from 2009 through 2011. In 2012, Texas A&M joined Arkansas in the Southeastern Conference, and the series reverted to the schools' home fields, Kyle Field in College Station, Texas for the 2012 game and Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville, Arkansas in 2013. The Southwest Classic returned to AT&T Stadium in 2014 and will remain there through at least 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, the Big 12 Conference game between the Baylor Bears and Texas Tech Red Raiders was held at Cowboys Stadium, the first time in the series the match-up was held on a neutral site. The game was the highest attended in the series' history, with 71,964 in attendance.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 2010 game was held at the Cotton Bowl in Fair Park, Dallas during the State Fair of Texas, the series returned to AT&T Stadium for the 2011 and 2012 games. The series' neutral site contract at AT&T Stadium could continue until 2014.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nAT&T Stadium has hosted a round of the AMA Supercross Championship since 2010, replacing Texas Stadium which had been host since 1975.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 20, 2008, Cowboys owner Jones and New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner announced a joint business venture called Legends Hospitality Management LLC which would operate the concessions and merchandising sales at the new Cowboys stadium in Arlington, Texas, and at the new Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, New York, along with the stadiums of the Yankees' minor league affiliates. Former Pizza Hut President Michael Rawlings will run the company from its new headquarters in Newark, New Jersey. The company was also backed by Wall Street investment firm Goldman Sachs and Dallas private equity firm CIC Partners LP.[101][102][103]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jones family commissioned 18 contemporary artists to create site-specific artworks for the stadium. The stadium features paintings, sculptures, and installations by Franz Ackerman, Doug Aitken, Ricci Albenda, Mel Bochner, Daniel Buren, Olafur Eliasson, Teresita Fernandez, Wayne Gonzales, Terry Haggerty, Trenton Doyle Hancock, Jacqueline Humphries, Jim Isermann, Annette Lawrence, Dave Muller, Gary Simmons, and Lawrence Weiner.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fees for premium parking at Dallas Cowboys games are estimated at $75 per game, based on season ticket holder parking charges.[105] The fees to park at major concerts and other sporting events will be nearly $40 per space at the new stadium.[106] A shuttle operates between the T&P Station and Cowboys Stadium for all Cowboys regular season and postseason games and selected college football games,[107] which averages approximately 900 riders per game.[107]  For special events like Super Bowl XLV parking prices can increase to as much as $990.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium is only accessible via the Metro Arlington Xpress (MAX) bus system; a 0.4?mi (0.64?km) walk from the Collins and Andrews stop which connects with the Trinity Rail Express (TRE) station at CentrePort/DFW Airport.","input":"What kind of roof does the at&t stadium have?"},{"output":"atheism","context":"The Soviet Union was established by the Bolsheviks in 1922, in place of the Russian Empire. At the time of the 1917 Revolution, the Russian Orthodox Church was deeply integrated into the autocratic state, enjoying official status. This was a significant factor that contributed to the Bolshevik attitude to religion and the steps they took to control it.[1] Thus the USSR became the first state to have as one objective of its official ideology the elimination of existing religion, and the prevention of future implanting of religious belief, with the goal of establishing state atheism (gosateizm).[2][3][4][5] Under the doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, there was a \\"government-sponsored program of conversion to atheism\\" conducted by Communists.[6][7][8] The communist regime targeted religions based on State interests, and while most organized religions were never outlawed, religious property was confiscated, believers were harassed, and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools.[2] In 1925 the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the persecution.[9] Accordingly, although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned, a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the official structures and mass media and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions (teachers, state bureaucrats, soldiers) to be openly religious.\\r\\nThe vast majority of people in the Russian empire were, at the time of the revolution, religious believers, whereas the communists aimed to break the power of all religious institutions and eventually replace religious belief with atheism. \\"Science\\" was counterposed to \\"religious superstition\\" in the media and in academic writing. The main religions of pre-revolutionary Russia persisted throughout the entire Soviet period, but they were only tolerated within certain limits. Generally, this meant that believers were free to worship in private and in their respective religious buildings (churches, mosques, etc.), but public displays of religion outside of such designated areas were prohibited. In addition, religious institutions were not allowed to express their views in any type of mass media, and many religious buildings were demolished or used for other purposes.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs the founder of the Soviet state, V. I. Lenin, put it:\\r\\nReligion is the opium of the people: this saying of Marx is the cornerstone of the entire ideology of Marxism about religion. All modern religions and churches, all and of every kind of religious organizations are always considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class.[10]\\r\\nMarxistÿLeninist atheism has consistently advocated the control, suppression, and elimination of religion. Within about a year of the revolution, the state expropriated all church property, including the churches themselves, and in the period from 1922 to 1926, 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and more than 1,200 priests were killed. Many more were persecuted.[11][12]\\r\\nChristians belonged to various churches: Orthodox (which had the largest number of followers), Catholic, Baptist and various other Protestant denominations. The majority of the Muslims in the Soviet Union were Sunni. Judaism also had many followers. Other religions, practiced by a small number of believers, included Buddhism and Shamanism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOrthodox Christians constituted a majority of believers in the Soviet Union. In the late 1980s, three Orthodox churches claimed substantial memberships there: the Russian Orthodox Church, the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (AOC). They were members of the major confederation of Orthodox churches in the world, generally referred to as the Eastern Orthodox Church. The first two functioned openly and were tolerated by the regime, but the Ukrainian AOC was not permitted to function openly. Parishes of the Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church reappeared in Belarus only after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but they did not receive recognition from the Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, which controls Belarusian eparchies.\\r\\nAccording to both Soviet and Western sources[citation needed],[which?] in the late 1980s the Russian Orthodox Church had over 50 million believers but only about 7,000 registered active churches. Over 4,000 of these churches were located in the Ukrainian Republic (almost half of them in western Ukraine). The distribution of the six monasteries and ten convents of the Russian Orthodox Church was equally disproportionate. Only two of the monasteries were located in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Another two were in Ukraine and there was one each in Belarus and Lithuania. Seven convents were located in Ukraine and one each in Moldova, Estonia, and Latvia.\\r\\nThe Georgian Orthodox Church, another autocephalous member of Eastern Orthodoxy, was headed by a Georgian patriarch. In the late 1980s it had 15 bishops, 180 priests, 200 parishes, and an estimated 2.5?million followers. In 1811 the Georgian Orthodox Church was incorporated into the Russian Orthodox Church, but it regained its independence in 1917, after the fall of the Tsar. Nevertheless, the Russian Orthodox Church did not officially recognize its independence until 1943.\\r\\nThe Ukrainian AOC separated from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1919, when the short-lived Ukrainian state adopted a decree declaring autocephaly from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.[clarification needed (from it or for it?)] Its independence was reaffirmed by the Bolsheviks in the Ukrainian Republic, and by 1924 it had 30 bishops, almost 1,500 priests, nearly 1,100 parishes, and between 4 and 6 million members.\\r\\nFrom its inception, the Ukrainian AOC faced the hostility of the Russian Orthodox Church in the Ukrainian Republic. In the late 1920s, Soviet authorities accused it of nationalist tendencies. In 1930 the government forced the church to reorganize as the \\"Ukrainian Orthodox Church\\", and few of its parishes survived until 1936. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian AOC continued to function outside the borders of the Soviet Union, and it was revived on Ukrainian territory under the German occupation during World War II. In the late 1980s, some of the Orthodox faithful in the Ukrainian Republic appealed to the Soviet government to reestablish the Ukrainian AOC.[clarification needed (with what result?)]\\r\\nThe Armenian Apostolic Church is an independent Oriental Orthodox church. In the 1980s it had about 4 million adherents?ÿ almost the entire population of Armenia. It was permitted 6 bishops, between 50 and 100 priests, and between 20 and 30 churches, and it had one theological seminary and six monasteries.\\r\\nCatholics formed a substantial and active religious constituency in the Soviet Union. Their number increased dramatically with the annexation of territories of the Second Polish Republic in 1939 and the Baltic republics in 1940. Catholics in the Soviet Union were divided between those belonging to the Roman Catholic Church, which was recognized by the government, and those remaining loyal to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, banned since 1946.\\r\\nThe majority of the 5.5?million Roman Catholics in the Soviet Union lived in the Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Latvian republics, with a sprinkling in the Moldavian, Ukrainian, and Russian republics. Since World War II, the most active Roman Catholic Church in the Soviet Union was in the Lithuanian Republic, where the majority of people are Catholics. The Roman Catholic Church there has been viewed as an institution that both fosters and defends Lithuanian national interests and values. Since 1972 a Catholic underground publication, The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania, supported not only Lithuanians' religious rights but also their national rights.\\r\\nWestern Ukraine, which included largely the historic region of Galicia, became part of the Soviet Union in 1939. Although Ukrainian, its population was never part of the Russian Empire, but was Eastern Rite Catholic. After the Second World War, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church identified closely with the nationalist aspirations of the region, arousing the hostility of the Soviet government, which was in combat with Ukrainian Insurgency. In 1945, Soviet authorities arrested the church's Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj, nine bishops and hundreds of clergy and leading lay activists, and deported them to forced labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere. The nine bishops and many of the clergy died in prisons, concentration camps, internal exile, or soon after their release during the post-Stalin thaw,[13] but after 18 years of imprisonment and persecution, Metropolitan Slipyj was released when Pope John XXIII intervened on his behalf. Slipyj went to Rome, where he received the title of Major Archbishop of Lviv, and became a cardinal in 1965.[13]\\r\\nIn 1946 a synod was called in Lviv, where, despite being uncanonical in both Catholic and Orthodox understanding, the Union of Brest was annulled, and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was officially annexed to the Russian Orthodox Church. St. George's Cathedral in Lviv became the throne of Russian Orthodox Archbishop Makariy.[13]\\r\\nFor the clergy that joined the Russian Orthodox Church, the Soviet authorities refrained from the large-scale persecution seen elsewhere. In Lviv only one church was closed. In fact, the western dioceses of Lviv-Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk were the largest in the USSR. Canon law was also relaxed, allowing the clergy to shave their beards (a practice uncommon in Orthodoxy) and to conduct services in Ukrainian instead of Slavonic.\\r\\nIn 1989 the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was officially re-established after a catacomb period of more than 40 years.[13] There followed conflicts between Orthodox and Catholic Christians regarding the ownership of church buildings, conflicts which continued into the 1990s, after the Independence of Ukraine.\\r\\nMany Protestants were apprehended under Communist rule of law, including imprisonment and execution. Vladimir Shelkov (1895ÿ1980), the leader of the unregistered Seventh-day Adventist movement in the Soviet Union, spent almost all his life from 1931 on in prison; he died in Yakutia camp. Large numbers of Pentecostals were imprisoned, and many died there, including Ivan Voronaev, one of their leaders.[14] In the period after the Second World War, Protestants in the USSR (indigenous sectarian Spiritual Christians, Baptists, Pentecostals, Adventists and others) were sent to mental hospitals or tried and imprisoned, often for refusal to enter military service. Some were deprived of their parental rights.[14] The Lutheran Church in different regions of the country was persecuted during the Soviet era, and church property was confiscated.[15] Many of its members and pastors were oppressed, and some were forced to emigrate.[16]\\r\\nBy 1950, it was estimated that there were 2 million Baptists in the Soviet Union, with the largest number in Ukraine.[17] Baptists were the largest Protestant grouping in the country. In 1991, Ukraine had the second largest Baptist community in the world, behind only the United States.[18] Baptists constituted the largest Protestant group. Spread throughout the Soviet Union, some congregations were registered with the government and functioned with official approval. Many other unregistered congregations carried on religious activity without such approval.\\r\\nLutherans, the second largest Protestant group, lived for the most part in the Latvian and Estonian republics. In the 1980s, Lutheran churches in these republics identified to some extent with nationality issues[clarification needed] in the two republics. The regime's attitude toward Lutherans was generally benign.[citation needed]\\r\\nA number of other Protestant groups were present, including Adventists, Pentecostals, and Reformed.\\r\\nThe March 1961 instruction on religious cults explained for the first time, that \\"sects, the teaching and character of activities of which has anti-state and savagely extremist [ҽ־Ѷҳ] character: Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentecostalists, Adventists-reformists\\" are not to be registered[19] and were thus banned.\\r\\nA number of congregations of Russian Mennonites, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Christian groups existed in the Soviet Union. Nearly 9,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were deported to Siberia in 1951 (numbers of those missed[clarification needed] in deportation unknown). The number of Jehovah's Witnesses increased greatly over this period, with a KGB estimate of around 20,000 in 1968. Russian Mennonites began to emigrate from the Soviet Union in the face of increasing violence and persecution, state restrictions on freedom of religion, and biased allotments of communal farmland. They emigrated to Germany, Britain, the United States, parts of South America, and other regions.\\r\\nAfter the Bolshevik revolution, Islam was for some time (until 1929) treated better than the Russian Orthodox Church, which Bolsheviks regarded as a center of the \\"reaction\\", and other religions. In the declaration \\"椾 ־켼 ҰͶҼ ^ ˾  Ҿ\\" (To All Working Muslims in Russia and the Orient) of November 1917, the Bolshevik government declared the freedom to exercise their religion and customs for Muslims \\"whose beliefs and customs had been suppressed by the Czars and the Russian oppressors\\".[20]\\r\\nIn the second half of 1920s and in 1930s, state repressions, suppression and atheist propaganda against all religions increased. E.g. in 1930, out of the 12,000 mosques in Tatarstan, more than 10,000 were closed, from 90 to 97% mullahs and muezzins were deprived of the right to exercise their profession.[21]\\r\\nDuring the German-Soviet War, the restrictions on religion were eased somewhat. In 1943 the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan was established. In 1949, 415 registered mosques functioned in the Soviet Union.[22]\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, Islam had the second largest following in the Soviet Union: between 45 and 50 million people identified themselves as Muslims. But the Soviet Union had only about 500 working mosques, a fraction of the number in prerevolutionary Russia, and Soviet law forbade Islamic religious activity outside working mosques and Islamic schools.\\r\\nAll working mosques, religious schools, and Islamic publications were supervised by four \\"spiritual directorates\\" established by Soviet authorities to provide government control. The Spiritual Directorate for Central Asia and Kazakhstan, the Spiritual Directorate for the European Soviet Union and Siberia, and the Spiritual Directorate for the Northern Caucasus and Dagestan oversaw the religious life of Sunni Muslims. The Spiritual Directorate for Transcaucasia dealt with both Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims. The overwhelming majority of the Muslims were Sunnis.\\r\\nSoviet Muslims differed linguistically and culturally from each other, speaking about fifteen Turkic languages, ten Iranian languages, and thirty Caucasian languages. Hence, communication between different Muslim groups was difficult. In 1989 Russian often served as a lingua franca among some educated Muslims.\\r\\nCulturally, some Muslim groups had highly developed urban traditions, whereas others were recently nomadic. Some lived in industrialized environments, others in isolated mountainous regions. In sum, Muslims were not a homogeneous group with a common national identity and heritage, although they shared the same religion and the same country.\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, unofficial Muslim congregations, meeting in tea houses and private homes with their own mullahs, greatly outnumbered those in the officially sanctioned mosques. The unofficial mullahs were either self-taught or informally trained by other mullahs. In the late 1980s, unofficial Islam appeared to split into fundamentalist congregations and groups that emphasized Sufism.\\r\\nSoviet policy toward religion was based on the ideology of Marxism-Leninism, which made atheism the official doctrine of the Communist Party. However, \\"the Soviet law and administrative practice through most of the 1920s extended some tolerance to religion and forbade the arbitrary closing or destruction of some functioning churches\\",[23] and each successive Soviet constitution granted freedom of belief. As the founder of the Soviet state, Lenin, put it:\\r\\nReligion is the opium of the people: this saying of Marx is the cornerstone of the entire ideology of Marxism about religion. All modern religions and churches, all and of every kind of religious organizations are always considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class.[10]\\r\\nMarxism-Leninism advocates the suppression and ultimately the disappearance of religious beliefs, considering them to be \\"unscientific\\" and \\"superstitious\\". In the 1920s and 1930s, such organizations as the League of the Militant Godless were active in anti-religious propaganda. Atheism was the norm in schools, communist organizations (such as the Young Pioneer Organization), and the media.\\r\\nThe regime's efforts to eradicate religion in the Soviet Union, however, varied over the years with respect to particular religions and were affected by higher state interests. In 1923, a New York Times correspondent saw Christians observing Easter peacefully in Moscow despite violent anti-religious actions in previous years.[24] Official policies and practices not only varied with time, but also differed in their application from one nationality to another and from one religion to another.\\r\\nIn 1929, with the onset of the Cultural Revolution in the Soviet Union and an upsurge of radical militancy in the Party and Komsomol, a powerful \\"hard line\\" in favor of mass closing of churches and arrests of priests became dominant and evidently won Stalin's approval. Secret \\"hard line\\" instructions were issued to local party organizations, but not published. When the anti-religious drive inflamed the anger of the rural population, not to mention that of the Pope and other Western church spokesmen, the regime was able to back off from a policy that it had never publicly endorsed anyway.[25][26]\\r\\nAlthough all Soviet leaders had the same long-range goal of developing a cohesive Soviet people, they pursued different policies to achieve it. For the Soviet regime, questions of nationality and religion were always closely linked. Therefore, their attitude toward religion also varied from a total ban on some religions to official support of others.\\r\\nIn theory, the Soviet Constitution described the regime's position regarding nationalities and religions. It stated that every Soviet citizen also had a particular nationality, and every Soviet passport carried these two entries. The constitution granted a large degree of local autonomy, but this autonomy was subordinated to central authority. In addition, because local and central administrative structures were often not clearly divided, local autonomy was further weakened. Although under the Constitution all nationalities were equal, in practice they were not treated so. Only fifteen nationalities had union republic status, which granted them, in principle, many rights, including the right to secede from the union.\\r\\nTwenty-two nationalities lived in autonomous republics with a degree of local self-government and representation in the Council of Nationalities in the Supreme Soviet. Eighteen more nationalities had territorial enclaves (autonomous oblasts and autonomous okrugs) but had very few powers of self-government. The remaining nationalities had no right of self-government at all. Joseph Stalin's 1913 definition of a nation as \\"a historically constituted and stable community of people formed on the basis of common language, territory, economic life, and psychological makeup revealed in a common culture\\" was retained by Soviet authorities throughout the 1980s.[citation needed] However, in granting nationalities union republic status, three additional factors were considered: a population of at least 1 million, territorial compactness, and location on the borders of the Soviet Union.\\r\\nAlthough Lenin believed that eventually all nationalities would merge into one, he insisted that the Soviet Union be established as a federation of formally equal nations. In the 1920s, genuine cultural concessions were granted to the nationalities. Communist elites of various nationalities were permitted to flourish and to have considerable self-government. National cultures, religions, and languages were not merely tolerated but, in areas with Muslim populations, encouraged.\\r\\nDemographic changes in the 1960s and 1970s whittled down the overall Russian majority, but they also caused two nationalities (the Kazakhs and Kirgiz) to become minorities in their own republics at the time of the 1979 census, and considerably reduced the majority of the titular nationalities in other republics. This situation led Leonid Brezhnev to declare at the 24th Communist Party Congress in 1971 that the process of creating a unified Soviet people had been completed, and proposals were made to abolish the federative system and replace it with a single state. In the 1970s, however, a broad movement of national dissent began to spread throughout the Soviet Union. It manifestated itself in many ways: Jews insisted on their right to emigrate to Israel; Crimean Tatars demanded to be allowed to return to Crimea; Lithuanians called for the restoration of the rights of the Catholic Church; and Helsinki Watch groups were established in the Georgian, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian republics. Petitions, literature, and occasional public demonstrations voiced public demands for the human rights of all nationalities. By the end of the 1970s, however, massive and concerted efforts by the KGB had largely suppressed the national dissent movement. Nevertheless, Brezhnev had learned his lesson. Proposals to dismantle the federative system were abandoned in favour of a policy of drawing the nationalities together more gradually.\\r\\nSoviet officials identified religion closely with nationality. The implementation of policy toward a particular religion, therefore, depended on the regime's perception of the bond between that religion and the nationality practicing it, the size of the religious community, the extent to which the religion accepted outside authority, and the nationality's willingness to subordinate itself to political authority. Thus the smaller the religious community and the more closely it identified with a particular nationality, the more restrictive were the regime's policies, especially if the religion also recognized a foreign authority such as the pope.\\r\\nAs for the Russian Orthodox Church, Soviet authorities sought to control it and, in times of national crisis, to exploit it for the regime's own purposes; but their ultimate goal was to eliminate it. During the first five years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests. Many others were imprisoned or exiled. Believers were harassed and persecuted. Most seminaries were closed, and the publication of most religious material was prohibited. By 1941 only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence prior to World War I.\\r\\nSuch crackdowns related to many people's dissatisfaction with the church in pre-revolutionary Russia. The close ties between the church and the state led to the perception of the church as corrupt and greedy by many members of the intelligentsia. Many peasants, while highly religious, also viewed the church unfavorably. Respect for religion did not extend to the local priests. The church owned a significant portion of Russia's land, and this was a bone of contention?ÿ land ownership was a big factor in the Russian Revolution of 1917.\\r\\nThe Nazi attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 induced Stalin to enlist the Russian Orthodox Church as an ally to arouse Russian patriotism against foreign aggression. Russian Orthodox religious life experienced a revival: thousands of churches were reopened; there were 22,000 by the time Nikita Khrushchev came to power. The regime permitted religious publications, and church membership grew.\\r\\nKhrushchev reversed the regime's policy of cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church. Although it remained officially sanctioned, in 1959 Khrushchev launched an antireligious campaign that was continued in a less stringent manner by his successor, Brezhnev. By 1975 the number of active Russian Orthodox churches was reduced to 7,000. Some of the most prominent members of the Russian Orthodox hierarchy and some activists were jailed or forced to leave the church. Their place was taken by docile clergy who were obedient to the state and who were sometimes infiltrated by KGB agents, making the Russian Orthodox Church useful to the regime. It espoused and propagated Soviet foreign policy and furthered the russification of non-Russian Christians, such as Orthodox Ukrainians and Belarusians.\\r\\nThe regime applied a different policy toward the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. Viewed by the government as very nationalistic, both were suppressed, first at the end of the 1920s and again in 1944 after they had renewed themselves under German occupation. The leadership of both churches was decimated; large numbers of priests were shot or sent to labor camps, and members of their congregations were harassed and persecuted.\\r\\nThe Georgian Orthodox Church was subject to a somewhat different policy and fared far worse than the Russian Orthodox Church. During World War II, however, it was allowed greater autonomy in running its affairs in return for calling its members to support the war effort, although it did not achieve the kind of accommodation with the authorities that the Russian Orthodox Church had. The government reimposed tight control over it after the war. Out of some 2,100 churches in 1917, only 200 were still open in the 1980s, and it was forbidden to serve its adherents outside the Georgian Republic. In many cases, the regime forced the Georgian Orthodox Church to conduct services in Old Church Slavonic instead of in the Georgian language.\\r\\nThe Soviet government's policies toward the Catholic Church were strongly influenced by Soviet Catholics' recognition of an outside authority as head of their church. As a result of World War II, millions of Catholics (including Greco-Catholics) became Soviet citizens and were subjected to new repression. Also, in the three republics where most of the Catholics lived, the Lithuanian SSR, the Byelorussian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR, Catholicism and nationalism were closely linked. Although the Roman Catholic Church was tolerated in Lithuania, large numbers of the clergy were imprisoned, many seminaries were closed, and police agents infiltrated the remainder. The anti-Catholic campaign in Lithuania abated after Stalin's death, but harsh measures against the church were resumed in 1957 and continued through the Brezhnev era.[citation needed]\\r\\nSoviet policy was particularly harsh toward the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. Ukrainian Greek-Catholics came under Soviet rule in 1939, when western Ukraine was incorporated into the Soviet Union as part of the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact. Although the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was permitted to function, it was almost immediately subjected to intense harassment.[citation needed] Retreating before the German army in 1941, Soviet authorities arrested large numbers of Ukrainian Greek Catholic priests, who were either killed or deported to Siberia.[13] After the Red Army reoccupied western Ukraine in 1944, the Soviet regime liquidated the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church by arresting its metropolitan, all of its bishops, hundreds of clergy, and the more active church members, killing some and sending the rest to labor camps. At the same time, Soviet authorities forced the remaining clergy to abrogate the union with Rome and subordinate themselves to the Russian Orthodox Church.\\r\\nBefore World War II, there were fewer Protestants in the Soviet Union than adherents of other faiths, but they showed remarkable growth since then. In 1944 the Soviet government established the All-Union Council of Evangelical Christian Baptists (now the Union of Evangelical Christians-Baptists of Russia) to gain some control over the various Protestant sects. Many congregations refused to join this body, however, and others that initially joined it subsequently left. All found that the state, through the council, was interfering in church life.\\r\\nA number of congregations of Russian Mennonites, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Christian groups faced varying levels of persecution under Soviet rule.\\r\\nJehovah's Witnesses were banned from practicing their religion. Under Operation North, the personal property of over eight-thousand members was confiscated, and they (along with underage children) were exiled to Siberia from 1951 until repeal in 1965. All were asked to sign a declaration of resignation as a Jehovah's Witness in order to not be deported. There is no existing record of any having signed this declaration. While in Siberia, some men, women, and children were forced to work as lumberjacks for a fixed wage. Victims reported living conditions to be very poor. From 1951 to 1991, Jehovah's Witnesses within and outside Siberia were incarcerated?ÿ and then rearrested after serving their terms. Some were forced to work in concentration camps, others forcibly enrolled in Marxist reeducation programs.[citation needed] KGB officials infiltrated the Jehovah's Witnesses organization in the Soviet Union, mostly to seek out hidden caches of theological literature. Soviet propaganda films depicted Jehovah's Witnesses as a cult, extremist, and engaging in mind control. Jehovah's Witnesses were legalized in the Soviet Union in 1991; victims were given social benefits equivalent to those of war veterans.\\r\\nEarly in the Bolshevik period, predominantly before the end of the Russian Civil War and the emergence of the Soviet Union, Russian Mennonite communities were harassed; several Mennonites were killed or imprisoned, and women were raped. Anarcho-Communist Nestor Makhno was responsible for most of the bloodshed, which caused the normally pacifist Mennonites to take up arms in defensive militia units. This marked the beginning of a mass exodus of Mennonites to Germany, the United States, and elsewhere. Mennonites were branded as kulaks by the Soviets. Their colonies' farms were collectivized under the Soviet Union's communal farming policy. Being predominantly German settlers, the Russian Mennonites in World War II saw the German forces invading Russia as liberators. Many were allowed passage to Germany as Volksdeutsche. Soviet officials began exiling Mennonite settlers in the eastern part of Russia to Siberia. After the war, the remaining Russian Mennonites were branded as Nazi conspirators and exiled to Kazakhstan and Siberia, sometimes being imprisoned or forced to work in concentration camps. In the 1990s the Russian government gave the Mennonites in Kazakhstan and Siberia the opportunity to emigrate.\\r\\nSoviet policy toward Islam was affected, on the one hand by the large Muslim population, its close ties to national cultures, and its tendency to accept Soviet authority, and on the other hand by its susceptibility to foreign influence. Although actively encouraging atheism, Soviet authorities permitted some limited religious activity in all the Muslim republics, under the auspices of the regional branches of the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of the USSR. Mosques functioned in most large cities of the Central Asian republics and the Azerbaijan Republic, but their number decreased from 25,000 in 1917 to 500 in the 1970s. Under Stalinist rule, Soviet authorities cracked down on Muslim clergy, closing many mosques or turning them into warehouses.[27] In 1989, as part of the general relaxation of restrictions on religions, some additional Muslim religious associations were registered, and some of the mosques that had been closed by the government were returned to Muslim communities. The government also announced plans to permit the training of limited numbers of Muslim religious leaders in two- and five-year courses in Ufa and Baku, respectively.\\r\\nAlthough Lenin publicly condemned anti-Semitism, the regime was hostile toward Judaism from the beginning.[28] In 1919 the Soviet authorities abolished Jewish community councils, which were traditionally responsible for maintaining synagogues. They created a special Jewish section of the party, whose tasks included propaganda against Jewish clergy and religion. To offset Jewish national and religious aspirations, and to reflect the Jewish national movement's role in the socialist movement of the Russian Empire (for example, Trotsky was first a member of the Jewish Bund, not the Social Democratic Labour Party), an alternative to the Land of Israel was established in 1934.\\r\\nThe Jewish Autonomous Oblast, created in 1928 by Stalin, with Birobidzhan in the Russian Far East as its administrative center, was to become a \\"Soviet Zion\\". Yiddish, rather than \\"reactionary\\" Hebrew, would be the national language, and proletarian socialist literature and arts would replace Judaism as the quintessence of its culture. Despite a massive domestic and international state propaganda campaign, the Jewish population there never reached 30% (as of 2003 it was only about 1.2%). The experiment ended in the mid-1930s, during Stalin's first campaign of purges. Jewish leaders were arrested and executed, and Yiddish schools were shut down. Further persecutions and purges followed.[29]\\r\\nThe training of rabbis became impossible until early 1940's, and until the late 1980s only one Yiddish periodical was published. Because of its identification with Zionism, Hebrew was taught only in schools for diplomats. Most of the 5,000 synagogues functioning prior to the Bolshevik Revolution were closed under Stalin, and others were closed under Khrushchev. The practice of Judaism became very difficult, intensifying the desire of Jews to leave the Soviet Union.[29]\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nSources","input":"What was the official religion of the soviet union?"},{"output":"breast cancer","context":"1JM7, 1JNX, 1N5O, 1OQA, 1T15, 1T29, 1T2U, 1T2V, 1Y98, 2ING, 3COJ, 3K0H, 3K0K, 3K15, 3PXA, 3PXB, 3PXC, 3PXD, 3PXE, 4IFI, 4IGK, 4JLU, 4OFB, 4U4A, 4Y18, 4Y2G\\r\\n672\\r\\n12189\\r\\nENSG00000012048\\r\\nENSMUSG00000017146\\r\\nP38398\\r\\nP48754\\r\\nNM_007299\\r\\nNM_007300\\r\\nNM_007301\\r\\nNM_007302\\r\\nNM_007303\\r\\nNM_007305\\r\\nNM_007306\\r\\nNM_009764\\r\\nNP_009225\\r\\nNP_009228\\r\\nNP_009229\\r\\nNP_009230\\r\\nNP_009231\\r\\nNP_033894\\r\\nBRCA1 and BRCA1 (/?br?k??w?n/[5]) are a human gene and its protein product, respectively. The official symbol (BRCA1, italic for the gene, nonitalic for the protein) and the official name (breast cancer 1) are maintained by the HGNC. Orthologs, styled Brca1 and Brca1, are common in other mammal species.[6] BRCA1 is a human tumor suppressor gene[7][8] (to be specific, a caretaker gene), found in all humans; its protein, also called by the synonym breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein, is responsible for repairing DNA.[9]\\r\\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 are normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissue, where they help repair damaged DNA, or destroy cells if DNA cannot be repaired. They are involved in the repair of chromosomal damage with an important role in the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks.[10][11] If BRCA1 or BRCA2 itself is damaged by a BRCA mutation, damaged DNA is not repaired properly, and this increases the risk for breast cancer.[12][13] BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been described as \\"breast cancer susceptibility genes\\" and \\"breast cancer susceptibility proteins\\". The predominate allele has a normal, tumor suppressive function whereas high penetrance mutations in these genes cause a loss of tumor suppressive function which correlates with an increased risk of breast cancer.[14]\\r\\nBRCA1 combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors and signal transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (BASC).[15] The BRCA1 protein associates with RNA polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone deacetylase complexes. Thus, this protein plays a role in transcription, DNA repair of double-strand breaks[13] ubiquitination, transcriptional regulation as well as other functions.[16]\\r\\nMethods to test for the likelihood of a patient with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 developing cancer were covered by patents owned or controlled by Myriad Genetics.[17][18] Myriad's business model of offering the diagnostic test exclusively led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012;[19] it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to obtain second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics lawsuit.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first evidence for the existence of a gene encoding for a DNA repair enzyme involved in breast cancer susceptibility was provided by Mary-Claire King's laboratory at UC Berkeley in 1990.[21] Four years later, after an international race to find it,[22] the gene was cloned in 1994 by scientists at University of Utah, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and Myriad Genetics.[17][23]\\r\\nThe human BRCA1 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 17 at region 2 band 1, from base pair 41,196,312 to base pair 41,277,500 (Build GRCh37/hg19) (map).[24] BRCA1 orthologs[6] have been identified in most mammals for which complete genome data are available.\\r\\nThe BRCA1 protein contains the following domains:[25]\\r\\nThis protein also contains nuclear localization signal and nuclear export signal motifs.[26]\\r\\nThe human BRCA1 protein consists of four major protein domains; the Znf C3HC4- RING domain, the BRCA1 serine domain and two BRCT domains. These domains encode approximately 27% of BRCA1 protein. There are six known isoforms of BRCA1,[27] with isoforms 1 and 2 comprising 1863 amino acids each.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe RING motif, a Zn finger found in eukaryotic peptides, is 40ÿ60 amino acids long and consists of eight conserved metal-binding residues, two quartets of cysteine or histidine residues that coordinate two zinc atoms.[29] This motif contains a short anti-parallel beta-sheet, two zinc-binding loops and a central alpha helix in a small domain. This RING domain interacts with associated proteins, including BARD1, which also contains a RING motif, to form a heterodimer. The BRCA1 RING motif is flanked by alpha helices formed by residues 8ÿ22 and 81ÿ96 of the BRCA1 protein. It interacts with a homologous region in BARD1 also consisting of a RING finger flanked by two alpha-helices formed from residues 36ÿ48 and 101ÿ116. These four helices combine to form a heterodimerization interface and stabilise the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer complex. Additional stabilisation is achieved by interactions between adjacent residues in the flanking region and hydrophobic interactions. The BARD1/BRCA1 interaction is disrupted by tumorigenic amino acid substitutions in BRCA1, implying that the formation of a stable complex between these proteins may be an essential aspect of BRCA1 tumor suppression.[29]\\r\\nThe ring domain is an important element of ubiquitin E3 ligases, which catalyse protein ubiquitination. Ubiquitin is a small regulatory protein found in all tissues that directs proteins to compartments within the cell. BRCA1 polypeptides, in particular Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains are dispersed throughout the resting cell nucleus, but at the start of DNA replication they gather in restrained groups that also contain BRCA2 and BARD1. BARD1 is thought to be involved in the recognition and binding of protein targets for ubiquitination.[30] It attaches to proteins and labels them for destruction. Ubiquitination occurs via the BRCA1 fusion protein and is abolished by zinc chelation.[29] The enzyme activity of the fusion protein is dependent on the proper folding of the ring domain.[citation needed]\\r\\nBRCA1 serine cluster domain (SCD) spans amino acids 1280ÿ1524. A portion of the domain is located in exons 11ÿ13. High rates of mutation occur in exons 11ÿ13. Reported phosphorylation sites of BRCA1 are concentrated in the SCD, where they are phosphorylated by ATM/ATR kinases both in vitro and in vivo. ATM/ATR are kinases activated by DNA damage. Mutation of serine residues may affect localization of BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage and DNA damage response function.[28][31]\\r\\nThe dual repeat BRCT domain of the BRCA1 protein is an elongated structure approximately 70 ? long and 30ÿ35 ? wide.[32] The 85ÿ95 amino acid domains in BRCT can be found as single modules or as multiple tandem repeats containing two domains.[33] Both of these possibilities can occur in a single protein in a variety of different conformations.[32] The C-terminal BRCT region of the BRCA1 protein is essential for repair of DNA, transcription regulation and tumor suppressor function.[34] In BRCA1 the dual tandem repeat BRCT domains are arranged in a head-to-tail-fashion in the three-dimensional structure, burying 1600 ? of hydrophobic, solvent-accessible surface area in the interface. These all contribute to the tightly packed knob-in-hole structure that comprises the interface. These homologous domains interact to control cellular responses to DNA damage. It is, therefore, no surprise that a missense mutation at the interface of these two proteins can have devastating consequences on the cell cycle, resulting in protein dysfunction and a greater risk of developing cancer. The link that joins these two homologs also needs to be considered, since its poorly defined electron density alludes to a possible complex function; the ability to flex.[32]\\r\\nBRCA1 is part of a complex that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. The strands of the DNA double helix are continuously breaking as they become damaged. Sometimes only one strand is broken, sometimes both strands are broken simultaneously. DNA cross-linking agents are an important source of chromosome/DNA damage. Double-strand breaks occur as intermediates after the crosslinks are removed, and indeed, biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been identified to be responsible for Fanconi Anemia, Complementation Group S,[35] a genetic disease associated with hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. BRCA1 is part of a protein complex that repairs DNA when both strands are broken. When this happens, it is difficult for the repair mechanism to \\"know\\" how to replace the correct DNA sequence, and there are multiple ways to attempt the repair. The double-strand repair mechanism in which BRCA1 participates is homologous recombination, where the repair proteins utilize a template of the identical homologous intact sequence from a sister chromatid, from a homologous chromosome, or from the same chromosome (depending on cell cycle phase).[36] This DNA repair takes place with the DNA in the cell nucleus, wrapped around the histone. Several proteins, including BRCA1, arrive at the histone-DNA complex for this repair. Regulatory aspect to BRCA1 nuclear ? non-nuclear distribution was first shown by the laboratory of Dr Rao in 1997[37]\\r\\nIn the nucleus of many types of normal cells, the BRCA1 protein interacts with RAD51 during repair of DNA double-strand breaks.[38] These breaks can be caused by natural radiation or other exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material (homologous recombination, e.g., \\"crossing over\\" during meiosis). The BRCA2 protein, which has a function similar to that of BRCA1, also interacts with the RAD51 protein. By influencing DNA damage repair, these three proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome.[citation needed]\\r\\nBRCA1 is also involved in another type of DNA repair, termed mismatch repair. BRCA1 interacts with the DNA mismatch repair protein MSH2.[39] MSH2, MSH6, PARP and some other proteins involved in single-strand repair are reported to be elevated in BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors.[40]\\r\\nA protein called valosin-containing protein (VCP, also known as p97) plays a role to recruit BRCA1 to the damaged DNA sites. After ionizing radiation, VCP is recruited to DNA lesions and cooperates with the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 to orchestrate assembly of signaling complexes for efficient DSB repair.[41] BRCA1 interacts with VCP.[42] BRCA1 also interacts with c-Myc, and other proteins that are critical to maintain genome stability.[43]\\r\\nBRCA1 directly binds to DNA, with higher affinity for branched DNA structures. This ability to bind to DNA contributes to its ability to inhibit the nuclease activity of the MRN complex as well as the nuclease activity of Mre11 alone.[44] This may explain a role for BRCA1 to promote lower fidelity DNA repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).[45] BRCA1 also colocalizes with -H2AX (histone H2AX phosphorylated on serine-139) in DNA double-strand break repair foci, indicating it may play a role in recruiting repair factors.[16][46]\\r\\nFormaldehyde and acetaldehyde are common environmental sources of DNA cross links that often require repairs mediated by BRCA1 containing pathways.[47][48]\\r\\nThis DNA repair function is essential; mice with loss-of-function mutations in both BRCA1 alleles are not viable, and as of 2015 only two adults were known to have loss-of-function mutations in both alleles; both had congenital or developmental issues, and both had cancer. One was presumed to have survived to adulthood because one of the BRCA1 mutations was hypomorphic.[49]\\r\\nBRCA1 was shown to co-purify with the human RNA Polymerase II holoenzyme in HeLa extracts, implying it is a component of the holoenzyme.[50] Later research, however, contradicted this assumption, instead showing that the predominant complex including BRCA1 in HeLa cells is a 2 megadalton complex containing SWI/SNF.[51] SWI/SNF is a chromatin remodeling complex. Artificial tethering of BRCA1 to chromatin was shown to decondense heterochromatin, though the SWI/SNF interacting domain was not necessary for this role.[46] BRCA1 interacts with the NELF-B (COBRA1) subunit of the NELF complex.[46]\\r\\nCertain variations of the BRCA1 gene lead to an increased risk for breast cancer as part of a hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. Researchers have identified hundreds of mutations in the BRCA1 gene, many of which are associated with an increased risk of cancer. Females with an abnormal BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have up to an 80% risk of developing breast cancer by age 90; increased risk of developing ovarian cancer is about 55% for females with BRCA1 mutations and about 25% for females with BRCA2 mutations.[52]\\r\\nThese mutations can be changes in one or a small number of DNA base pairs (the building-blocks of DNA), and can be identified with PCR and DNA sequencing.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn some cases, large segments of DNA are rearranged. Those large segments, also called large rearrangements, can be a deletion or a duplication of one or several exons in the gene. Classical methods for mutation detection (sequencing) are unable to reveal these types of mutation.[53] Other methods have been proposed: traditional quantitative PCR,[54] Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA),[55] and Quantitative Multiplex PCR of Short Fluorescent Fragments (QMPSF).[56] Newer methods have also been recently proposed: heteroduplex analysis (HDA) by multi-capillary electrophoresis or also dedicated oligonucleotides array based on comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH).[57]\\r\\nSome results suggest that hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter, which has been reported in some cancers, could be considered as an inactivating mechanism for BRCA1 expression.[58]\\r\\nA mutated BRCA1 gene usually makes a protein that does not function properly. Researchers believe that the defective BRCA1 protein is unable to help fix DNA damage leading to mutations in other genes. These mutations can accumulate and may allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. Thus, BRCA1 inactivating mutations lead to a predisposition for cancer.[citation needed]\\r\\nBRCA1 mRNA 3' UTR can be bound by an miRNA, Mir-17 microRNA. It has been suggested that variations in this miRNA along with Mir-30 microRNA could confer susceptibility to breast cancer.[59]\\r\\nIn addition to breast cancer, mutations in the BRCA1 gene also increase the risk of ovarian and prostate cancers. Moreover, precancerous lesions (dysplasia) within the Fallopian tube have been linked to BRCA1 gene mutations. Pathogenic mutations anywhere in a model pathway containing BRCA1 and BRCA2 greatly increase risks for a subset of leukemias and lymphomas.[13]\\r\\nFemales having inherited a defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have risks for breast and ovarian cancer that are so high and seem so selective that many mutation carriers choose to have prophylactic surgery. There has been much conjecture to explain such apparently striking tissue specificity. Major determinants of where BRCA1/2 hereditary cancers occur are related to tissue specificity of the cancer pathogen, the agent that causes chronic inflammation or the carcinogen. The target tissue may have receptors for the pathogen, may become selectively exposed to an inflammatory process or to a carcinogen. An innate genomic deficit in a tumor suppressor gene impairs normal responses and exacerbates the susceptibility to disease in organ targets. This theory also fits data for several tumor suppressors beyond BRCA1 or BRCA2. A major advantage of this model is that it suggests there may be some options in addition to prophylactic surgery.[60]\\r\\nBRCA1 expression is reduced or undetectable in the majority of high grade, ductal breast cancers.[61] It has long been noted that loss of BRCA1 activity, either by germ-line mutations or by down-regulation of gene expression, leads to tumor formation in specific target tissues. In particular, decreased BRCA1 expression contributes to both sporadic and inherited breast tumor progression.[62] Reduced expression of BRCA1 is tumorigenic because it plays an important role in the repair of DNA damages, especially double-strand breaks, by the potentially error-free pathway of homologous recombination.[63] Since cells that lack the BRCA1 protein tend to repair DNA damages by alternative more error-prone mechanisms, the reduction or silencing of this protein generates mutations and gross chromosomal rearrangements that can lead to progression to breast cancer.[63]\\r\\nSimilarly, BRCA1 expression is low in the majority (55%) of sporadic epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) where EOCs are the most common type of ovarian cancer, representing approximately 90% of ovarian cancers.[64] In serous ovarian carcinomas, a sub-category constituting about 2/3 of EOCs, low BRCA1 expression occurs in more than 50% of cases.[65] Bowtell[66] reviewed the literature indicating that deficient homologous recombination repair caused by BRCA1 deficiency is tumorigenic. In particular this deficiency initiates a cascade of molecular events that sculpt the evolution of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and dictate its response to therapy. Especially noted was that BRCA1 deficiency could be the cause of tumorigenesis whether due to BRCA1 mutation or any other event that causes a deficiency of BRCA1 expression.\\r\\nOnly about 3%ÿ8% of all women with breast cancer carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2.[67] Similarly, BRCA1 mutations are only seen in about 18% of ovarian cancers (13% germline mutations and 5% somatic mutations).[68]\\r\\nThus, while BRCA1 expression is low in the majority of these cancers, BRCA1 mutation is not a major cause of reduced expression.\\r\\nBRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was present in only 13% of unselected primary breast carcinomas.[69] Similarly, BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was present in only 5% to 15% of EOC cases.[64]\\r\\nThus, while BRCA1 expression is low in these cancers, BRCA1 promoter methylation is only a minor cause of reduced expression.\\r\\nThere are a number of specific microRNAs, when overexpressed, that directly reduce expression of specific DNA repair proteins (see MicroRNA section DNA repair and cancer) In the case of breast cancer, microRNA-182 (miR-182) specifically targets BRCA1.[70] Breast cancers can be classified based on receptor status or histology, with triple-negative breast cancer (15%ÿ25% of breast cancers), HER2+ (15%ÿ30% of breast cancers), ER+/PR+ (about 70% of breast cancers), and Invasive lobular carcinoma (about 5%ÿ10% of invasive breast cancer). All four types of breast cancer were found to have an average of about 100-fold increase in miR-182, compared to normal breast tissue.[71] In breast cancer cell lines, there is an inverse correlation of BRCA1 protein levels with miR-182 expression.[70] Thus it appears that much of the reduction or absence of BRCA1 in high grade ductal breast cancers may be due to over-expressed miR-182.\\r\\nIn addition to miR-182, a pair of almost identical microRNAs, miR-146a and miR-146b-5p, also repress BRCA1 expression. These two microRNAs are over-expressed in triple-negative tumors and their over-expression results in BRCA1 inactivation.[72] Thus, miR-146a and/or miR-146b-5p may also contribute to reduced expression of BRCA1 in these triple-negative breast cancers.\\r\\nIn both serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (the precursor lesion to high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HG-SOC)), and in HG-SOC itself, miR-182 is overexpressed in about 70% of cases.[73] In cells with over-expressed miR-182, BRCA1 remained low, even after exposure to ionizing radiation (which normally raises BRCA1 expression).[73] Thus much of the reduced or absent BRCA1 in HG-SOC may be due to over-expressed miR-182.\\r\\nAnother microRNA known to reduce expression of BRCA1 in ovarian cancer cells is miR-9.[64] Among 58 tumors from patients with stage IIIC or stage IV serous ovarian cancers (HG-SOG), an inverse correlation was found between expressions of miR-9 and BRCA1,[64] so that increased miR-9 may also contribute to reduced expression of BRCA1 in these ovarian cancers.\\r\\nDNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer,[74][75] and deficiencies in DNA repair appears to underlie many forms of cancer.[76] If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage may increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage may also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair.[77][78] Such mutations and epigenetic alterations may give rise to cancer. The frequent microRNA-induced deficiency of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers likely contribute to the progression of those cancers.\\r\\nAll germ-line BRCA1 mutations identified to date have been inherited, suggesting the possibility of a large founder effect in which a certain mutation is common to a well-defined population group and can, in theory, be traced back to a common ancestor. Given the complexity of mutation screening for BRCA1, these common mutations may simplify the methods required for mutation screening in certain populations. Analysis of mutations that occur with high frequency also permits the study of their clinical expression.[79] Examples of manifestations of a founder effect are seen among Ashkenazi Jews. Three mutations in BRCA1 have been reported to account for the majority of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with inherited BRCA1-related breast and/or ovarian cancer: 185delAG, 188del11 and 5382insC in the BRCA1 gene.[80][81] In fact, it has been shown that if a Jewish woman does not carry a BRCA1 185delAG, BRCA1 5382insC founder mutation, it is highly unlikely that a different BRCA1 mutation will be found.[82] Additional examples of founder mutations in BRCA1 are given in Table 1 (mainly derived from [79]).\\r\\nAs women age, their reproductive performance declines, leading to menopause. This decline is tied to a reduction in the number of ovarian follicles. Although about 1 million oocytes are present at birth in the human ovary, only about 500 (about 0.05%) of these ovulate, and the rest are wasted. The decline in ovarian reserve appears to occur at a constantly increasing rate with age,[113] and leads to nearly complete exhaustion of the reserve by about age 52. As ovarian reserve and fertility decline with age, there is also a parallel increase in pregnancy failure and meiotic errors, resulting in chromosomally abnormal conceptions.[citation needed]\\r\\nWomen with a germ-line BRCA1 mutation appear to have a diminished oocyte reserve and decreased fertility compared to normally aging women.[114] Furthermore, women with an inherited BRCA1 mutation undergo menopause prematurely.[115] Since BRCA1 is a key DNA repair protein, these findings suggest that naturally occurring DNA damages in oocytes are repaired less efficiently in women with a BRCA1 defect, and that this repair inefficiency leads to early reproductive failure.[114]\\r\\nAs noted above, the BRCA1 protein plays a key role in homologous recombinational repair. This is the only known cellular process that can accurately repair DNA double-strand breaks. DNA double-strand breaks accumulate with age in humans and mice in primordial follicles.[116] Primordial follicles contain oocytes that are at an intermediate (prophase I) stage of meiosis. Meiosis is the general process in eukaryotic organisms by which germ cells are formed, and it is likely an adaptation for removing DNA damages, especially double-strand breaks, from germ line DNA.[117] (Also see article Meiosis). Homologous recombinational repair employing BRCA1 is especially promoted during meiosis. It was found that expression of 4 key genes necessary for homologous recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks (BRCA1, MRE11, RAD51 and ATM) decline with age in the oocytes of humans and mice,[116] leading to the hypothesis that DNA double-strand break repair is necessary for the maintenance of oocyte reserve and that a decline in efficiency of repair with age plays a role in ovarian aging.\\r\\nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. At diagnosis, almost 70% of persons with NSCLC have locally advanced or metastatic disease. Persons with NSCLC are often treated with therapeutic platinum compounds (e.g. cisplatin, carboplatin or oxaliplatin) that cause inter-strand cross-links in DNA. Among individuals with NSCLC, low expression of BRCA1 in the primary tumor correlated with improved survival after platinum-containing chemotherapy.[118][119] This correlation implies that low BRCA1 in the cancer, and the consequent low level of DNA repair, causes vulnerability of the cancer to treatment by the DNA cross-linking agents. High BRCA1 may protect cancer cells by acting in a pathway that removes the damages in DNA introduced by the platinum drugs. Thus the level of BRCA1 expression is a potentially important tool for tailoring chemotherapy in lung cancer management.[118][119]\\r\\nLevel of BRCA1 expression is also relevant to ovarian cancer treatment. Patients having sporadic ovarian cancer who were treated with platinum drugs had longer median survival times if their BRCA1 expression was low compared to patients with higher BRCA1 expression (46 compared to 33 months).[120]\\r\\nA patent application for the isolated BRCA1 gene and cancer promoting mutations discussed above, as well as methods to diagnose the likelihood of getting breast cancer, was filed by the University of Utah, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and Myriad Genetics in 1994;[17] over the next year, Myriad, (in collaboration with investigators at Endo Recherche, Inc., HSC Research & Development Limited Partnership, and University of Pennsylvania), isolated and sequenced the BRCA2 gene and identified key mutations, and the first BRCA2 patent was filed in the U.S. by Myriad and other institutions in 1995.[18] Myriad is the exclusive licensee of these patents and has enforced them in the US against clinical diagnostic labs.[20] This business model led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012;[19] it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics lawsuit.[20][121] The patents began to expire in 2014.\\r\\nAccording to an article published in the journal, Genetic Medicine, in 2010, \\"The patent story outside the United States is more complicated.... For example, patents have been obtained but the patents are being ignored by provincial health systems in Canada. In Australia and the UK, Myriads licensee permitted use by health systems, but announced a change of plans in August 2008. Only a single mutation has been patented in Myriads lone European-wide patent, although some patents remain under review of an opposition proceeding. In effect, the United States is the only jurisdiction where Myriads strong patent position has conferred sole-provider status.\\"[122][123] Peter Meldrum, CEO of Myriad Genetics, has acknowledged that Myriad has \\"other competitive advantages that may make such [patent] enforcement unnecessary\\" in Europe.[124]\\r\\nLegal decisions surrounding the BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents will affect the field of genetic testing in general.[125] A June 2013 article, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (No. 12-398), quoted the US Supreme Court's unanimous ruling that, \\"A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,\\" invalidating Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature could still be eligible for patent protection.[126] The Federal Court of Australia came to the opposite conclusion, upholding the validity of an Australian Myriad Genetics patent over the BRCA1 gene in February 2013.[127] The Federal Court also rejected an appeal in September 2014.[128] Yvonne DArcy won her case against US-based biotech company Myriad Genetics in the High Court of Australia. In their unanimous decision on October 7, 2015 the \\"high court found that an isolated nucleic acid, coding for a BRCA1 protein, with specific variations from the norm that are indicative of susceptibility to breast cancer and ovarian cancer was not a 'patentable invention.'\\"[129]\\r\\nBRCA1 has been shown to interact with the following proteins:","input":"What type of cancer is associated with the brac1 gene?"},{"output":"Romulus","context":"The King of Rome (Latin: Rex Romae) was the chief magistrate of the Roman Kingdom.[1] According to legend, the first king of Rome was Romulus, who founded the city in 753 BC upon the Palatine Hill. Seven legendary kings are said to have ruled Rome until 509 BC, when the last king was overthrown. These kings ruled for an average of 35 years.\\r\\nThe kings after Romulus were not known to be dynasts and no reference is made to the hereditary principle until after the fifth king Tarquinius Priscus. Consequently, some have assumed that the Tarquins and their attempt to institute a hereditary monarchy over this conjectured earlier elective monarchy resulted in the formation of the republic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Rome was not self-governing, and was ruled by the king (rex). The king possessed absolute power over the people. The senate was a weak oligarchy, capable of exercising only minor administrative powers, so that Rome was ruled by its king who was in effect an absolute monarch. The senate's main function was to carry out and administer the wishes of the king. After Romulus, Rome's first legendary king, Roman kings were elected by the people of Rome, sitting as a Curiate Assembly, who voted on the candidate that had been nominated by a chosen member of the senate called an interrex. Candidates for the throne could be chosen from any source. For example, one such candidate, Lucius Tarquinius Priscus was originally a citizen and migrant from a neighboring Etruscan city-state. The people of Rome, sitting as the Curiate Assembly, could then either accept or reject the nominated candidate-king.\\r\\nThe insignia of the king was twelve lictors wielding the fasces, a throne of a Curule chair, the purple Toga Picta, red shoes, and a white diadem around the head. Only the king could wear a purple toga.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe supreme power of the state was vested in the rex, whose position gave the following powers:\\r\\nBeyond his religious authority, the king was invested with the supreme military, executive, and judicial authority through the use of imperium. The imperium of the king was held for life and protected him from ever being brought to trial for his actions. As being the sole owner of imperium in Rome at the time, the king possessed ultimate executive power and unchecked military authority as the commander-in-chief of all Rome's legions. His executive power and his sole imperium allowed him to issue decrees with the force of law. Also, the laws that kept citizens safe from the misuse of magistrates owning imperium did not exist during the times of the king.\\r\\nAnother power of the king was the power to either appoint or nominate all officials to offices. The king would appoint a tribunus celerum to serve as both the tribune of Ramnes tribe in Rome but also as the commander of the king's personal bodyguard, the Celeres. The king was required to appoint the tribune upon entering office and the tribune left office upon the king's death. The tribune was second in rank to the king and also possessed the power to convene the Curiate Assembly and lay legislation before it.\\r\\nAnother officer appointed by the king was the praefectus urbi, which acted as the warden of the city. When the king was absent from the city, the prefect held all of the king's powers and abilities, even to the point of being bestowed with imperium while inside the city. The king even received the right to be the sole person to appoint patricians to the Senate.\\r\\nThe king's imperium granted him both military powers as well as qualified him to pronounce legal judgment in all cases as the chief justice of Rome. Although he could assign pontiffs to act as minor judges in some cases, he had supreme authority in all cases brought before him, both civil and criminal. This made the king supreme in times of both war and peace. While some writers believed there was no appeal from the king's decisions, others believed that a proposal for appeal could be brought before the king by any patrician during a meeting of the Curiate Assembly.\\r\\nTo assist the king, a council advised the king during all trials, but this council had no power to control the king's decisions. Also, two criminal detectives (Quaestores Parridici) were appointed by him as well as a two-man criminal court (Duumviri Perduellionis) which oversaw for cases of treason.\\r\\nUnder the kings, the Senate and Curiate Assembly had very little power and authority; they were not independent bodies in that they possessed the right to meet together and discuss questions of state. They could only be called together by the king and could only discuss the matters the king laid before them. While the Curiate Assembly did have the power to pass laws that had been submitted by the king, the Senate was effectively an honorable council. It could advise the king on his action but, by no means, could prevent him from acting. The only thing that the king could not do without the approval of the Senate and Curiate Assembly was to declare war against a foreign nation. These issues effectively allowed the King to more or less rule by decree with the exception of the above-mentioned affairs.\\r\\nWhenever a Roman king died, Rome entered a period of interregnum (literally: between kings). Supreme power in the state would be devolved to the Senate, which had the task of finding a new king. The Senate would assemble and appoint one of its own members as the interrex to serve for a period of five days with the sole purpose of nominating the next king of Rome. After the five-day period, the interrex would appoint (with the Senate's consent) another Senator for another five-day term. This process would continue until the election of a new king. Once the interrex found a suitable nominee for the kingship, he would bring the nominee before the Senate and the Senate would examine him.[citation needed] If the Senate confirmed the nomination, the interrex would convene the Curiate Assembly and preside as its chairman during the election of the King.\\r\\nOnce a candidate was proposed to the Curiate Assembly, the people of Rome could either accept or reject the King-elect. If accepted, the King-elect did not immediately take office: two additional acts had to take place before he was invested with the full regal authority and power. First, it was necessary to obtain the divine will of the gods respecting his appointment by means of the auspices, since the king would serve as high priest of Rome. An augur performed this ceremony by conducting the King-elect to the citadel where he was placed on a stone seat as the people waited below. If the King-elect was found worthy of the kingship, the augur announced that the gods had given favourable tokens, thus confirming the King-elects priestly character. Second the imperium had to be conferred upon the King. The Curiate Assembly's vote only determined who was to be King, but that act did not bestow the powers of the king upon him. Accordingly, the King himself proposed to the Curiate Assembly a bill granting him imperium, and the Curiate Assembly, by voting in favour of the law, would grant it.\\r\\nIn theory, the people of Rome elected their leader, but the Senate had most of the control over the process.\\r\\nSince Rome's records were destroyed in 390 BC when the city was sacked, it is impossible to know for certain how many kings actually ruled the city, or if any of the deeds attributed to the individual kings, by later writers, are accurate.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe overthrow of the Roman monarchy of Tarquinius Superbus led, in only a very limited way, to the separation of the powers mentioned above.\\r\\nThe actual title of king was retained for the rex sacrorum, who formally remained Rome's first priest. He was forbidden any political or military career, except indeed a seat in the senate. However, the Roman desire to hinder the kingship from becoming important went so far that, even in the area of religion, the king of sacrifices was formally, in all but protocol, subordinated to the first of the pontiffs, the pontifex maximus (whose position in origin, rather than with the name of priest, is better described as \\"minister of religion\\"), to the point that at some point in history, the regia or royal palace at the Forum Romanum, originally inhabited by the king of sacrifices,[7] was ceded to the pontifex maximus.[8] Significantly enough, one of his major appearances in the public scene was the festival of Regifugium, where he impersonated the king in his being thrown out of the city; also, the consuls themselves retained religious roles vital enough that the office of interrex was retained for the opening prayer of electional assemblies in case that both consuls had died in office, and the ritual of driving a nail into the temple of Jupiter sometimes even induced a dictatorship. Nor was the rex sacrorum elected publicly, but chosen by the pontifical college.\\r\\nThe king of sacrifices retained some religious rites only he could perform, and acted as quasi-flamen to Janus. He seems to have existed until the official adoption of the Christian religion. To qualify for the office, patrician ancestry was necessary; however it was once performed by a member of a family otherwise known as plebeian, the Marcii, earning for himself and his descendants the cognomen Rex.\\r\\nAs has been mentioned, the administrative functions in religion, including at some point the housing in the ancient royal court, were ceded to the supreme pontiff.\\r\\nThe previous role of the king in choosing new senators and dismissing people from the senate was ceded to the censors, albeit in the late republic, the first of these functions was rather limited as all magistrates down to the rank of quaestor gradually had gained admission to the senate after the office's expiration.\\r\\nThe modern concept of a head of state, insofar as the republican times excepting the dictatorships are concerned, can hardly be translated to Roman conceptions, but basically all other powersthe imperiumwere ceded to the consuls (the etymology suggests that these were originally the king's chief counsellors) and, after the creation of the office (about 367, according to Livy, thereby at least roughly separating the judiciary from the executive), the praetors (\\"leaders\\"[9]). According to tradition (which is disputed by historians for the first decades), the consulate was however always entrusted to two persons for hindering dominance; for emergency situations a dictatorship was introduced. Later, also proconsuls and propraetors could be given an imperium by appointment of the senate. Whoever used the imperium to victoriously lead an army could acquire the title of imperator, which later became chief title to the emperors, who were technically included in the system as proconsuls over most (and the strategically most important parts) of the empire, chief senators, and popular tribunes without the title. The republican idea that all promagisterial imperium ends upon entering the city was not observed in the emperors' case.\\r\\nAt the same time, the legislation was practically passed from the Curiate Assembly to the Centuriate Assembly (and Tribal Assembly), exception the more-or-less formality of a lex curiata de imperio which ratified the elections of the previous Centuriate Assembly. The consuls did however retain the power to rule by ordinance.","input":"Who was the first king of the roman empire?"},{"output":"Jamestown, Virginia","context":"The New England Colonies of British America included Connecticut Colony, Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Massachusetts Bay Colony, and Province of New Hampshire, as well as a few smaller short-lived colonies. The New England colonies were part of the Thirteen Colonies and eventually became five of the six states in New England.[1] Captain John Smith was the author of the 1616 work A Description of New England which first applied the term \\"New England\\"[2] to the coastal lands from Long Island Sound to Newfoundland.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance, England, and other countries made several attempts to colonize New England early in the 17th century, and those nations were often in contention for lands in the New World. French nobleman Pierre Dugua Sieur de Monts established a settlement on Saint Croix Island, Maine in June 1604 under the authority of the King of France. The small St. Croix River Island is located on the northern boundary of present-day Maine. Nearly half the settlers perished due to the harsh winter and scurvy, and the survivors moved north out of New England to Port-Royal of Nova Scotia (see symbol \\"R\\" on map to the right) in the spring of 1605.[4]\\r\\nKing James I of England recognized the need for a permanent settlement in New England, and he granted competing royal charters to the Plymouth Company and the London Company. The Plymouth Company ships arrived at the mouth of the Kennebec River (then called the Sagadahoc River) in August 1607 where they established a settlement named Sagadahoc Colony, better known as Popham Colony (see symbol \\"Po\\" on map to right) to honor financial backer Sir John Popham. The colonists faced a harsh winter, the loss of supplies following a storehouse fire, and mixed relations with the indigenous tribes.\\r\\nColony leader Captain George Popham died, and Raleigh Gilbert decided to return to England to take up an inheritance left by the death of an older brotherat which point, all of the colonists decided to return to England. It was around August 1608 when they left on the ship Mary and John and a new ship built by the colony named Virginia of Sagadahoc. The 30-ton Virginia was the first sea-going ship ever built in North America.[5]\\r\\nConflict over land rights continued through the early 17th century, with the French constructing Fort Pentagouet near present-day Castine, Maine in 1613. The fort protected a trading post and a fishing station and was considered the first longer-term settlement in New England. It changed hands multiple times throughout the 17th century among the English, French, and Dutch colonists.[6]\\r\\nIn 1614, Dutch explorer Adriaen Block traveled along the coast of Long Island Sound and then up the Connecticut River to present-day Hartford, Connecticut. By 1623, the Dutch West India Company regularly traded for furs there and, ten years later, they fortified it for protection from the Pequot Indians and named the site \\"House of Hope\\" (also identified as \\"Fort Hoop,\\" \\"Good Hope,\\" and \\"Hope\\").[7]\\r\\nA group of Puritans known as the Pilgrims arrived on the Mayflower from England and the Netherlands to establish Plymouth Colony in modern-day Massachusetts, the second successful English colony in North America, following Jamestown, Virginia. About half of the one hundred-plus passengers on the Mayflower died that first winter, mostly because of diseases contracted on the voyage followed by a harsh winter.[8] In 1621, an Indian named Squanto taught the colonists how to grow corn and where to catch eels and fish. His assistance was invaluable and helped the Pilgrims to survive the early years of the colonization. The Pilgrims lived on the same site where Squanto's Patuxet tribe had established a village before they were wiped out from diseases.[9]\\r\\nThe Plymouth settlement faced great hardships and earned few profits, but it enjoyed a positive reputation in England and may have sown the seeds for further immigration. Edward Winslow and William Bradford published an account of their adventures in 1622 called Mourt's Relation.[10] This book was only a small glimpse of the hardships and adventures encountered by the Pilgrims, but it may have served to encourage other Puritans to emigrate during the Great Migration.\\r\\nThe Puritans in England first sent smaller groups in the mid-1620s to establish colonies, buildings, and food supplies, learning from the Pilgrims' harsh experiences of winter in the Plymouth Colony. In 1623, the Plymouth Council for New England (successor to the Plymouth Company) established a small fishing village at Cape Ann under the supervision of the Dorchester Company. The first group of Puritans moved to a new town at nearby Naumkeag after the Dorchester Company dropped support, and fresh financial support was found by Rev. John White. Other settlements were started in nearby areas; however, the overall Puritan population remained small through the 1620s.[11]\\r\\nA larger group of Puritans arrived in 1630, leaving England because they desired to worship in a manner that differed from the Church of England. Their views were in accord with those of the Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower, except that the Pilgrims were known as \\"separatists\\" because they felt that they needed to separate themselves from the Church of England, whereas the later Puritans were content to remain under the umbrella of the Church of England. The separate colonies were governed independent of each other until 1691, when Plymouth Colony was absorbed into the Massachusetts Bay Colony to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay.\\r\\nEarly dissenters of the Puritan laws were often banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Connecticut Colony was started after Puritan minister Thomas Hooker left Massachusetts Bay with around 100 followers in search of greater religious and political freedom. Puritan minister Roger Williams left Massachusetts Bay to found the Rhode Island Colony, while John Wheelwright left with his followers to a colony in present-day New Hampshire and shortly thereafter on to present day Maine. The Puritans also established the American public school system for the express purpose of ensuring that future generations would be able to read the Bible for themselves, which was a central tenet of Puritan worship.[12]\\r\\nIt was the dead of winter in January 1636 when Salem minister Roger Williams had been banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony because of theological differences. In Salem, he preached that government and religion should be separate; he also believed that the Wampanoag and Narragansett tribes had been treated unfairly. That winter, the tribes helped Williams to survive and sold him land for a new colony in present-day Providence, Rhode Island which he named Providence Plantation in recognition of the intervention of Divine Providence in establishing the new colony. It was unique in its day in expressly providing for religious freedom and a separation of church from state.\\r\\nRoger Williams returned to England two times to prevent the attempt of other colonies to take over Providence and to charter or incorporate Providence and other nearby communities into the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.[13]\\r\\nLater in 1636, Thomas Hooker left Massachusetts with one hundred followers and founded a new English settlement just north of the Dutch Fort Hoop that became Connecticut Colony. The community was first named Newtown then renamed Hartford shortly afterwards to honor the English town of Hertford. One of the reasons why Hooker left was that only members of the church could vote and participate in the government in Massachusetts Bay, which he believed should include any adult male owning property. The Connecticut Colony was not the first settlement in Connecticut (the Dutch were first) or even the first English settlement (Windsor was first in 1633). Thomas Hooker obtained a royal charter and established Fundamental Orders, considered to be one of the first constitutions in North America. Other colonies later merged into the royal charter for the Connecticut Colony, including New Haven and Saybrook.\\r\\nThe earliest colonies in New England were usually fishing villages or farming communities on the more fertile land along the rivers. The rocky soil in the New England Colonies was not as fertile as the Middle or Southern Colonies, but the land provided rich resources, including lumber that was valued for building homes and ships. Lumber was also a resource that could be exported back to England, where there was a shortage of wood. In addition, the hunting of wildlife provided furs to be traded and food for the table.\\r\\nIn Massachusetts their economy was heavily based off of small industries with people working as, porters, tanners, shopkeepers ?and metalworkers. They had merchants which carried raw materials such as furs, timber, and the tar and pitch needed for shipbuilding. ?Trade went on directly between the English colonists and the European Caribbean islands.\\r\\nThe New England Colonies were located near the ocean where there was an abundance of whales, fish, and other marketable sea life. Excellent harbors and some inland waterways offered protection for ships and were also valuable for fresh water fishing. By the end of the 17th century, New England colonists had created an Atlantic trade network that connected them to the English homeland as well as the West African slave coast, the Caribbean's plantation islands, and the Iberian Peninsula. Colonists relied upon British and European imports for glass, linens, hardware, machinery, and other items for the colonial household.\\r\\nThe Southern Colonies could produce tobacco, rice, and indigo in exchange for imports, whereas New England's colonies could not offer much to England beyond fish, furs, and lumber. Inflation was a major issue in the economy. During the 18th century, shipbuilding drew upon the abundant lumber and revived the economy, often under the direction of the British Crown.[14]\\r\\nEnslavement of enemies defeated in war was a common practice in European nations at this time. This was a policy that had been going on for decades in Ireland, particularly since the time of Elizabeth I and during the mid-17th century Cromwell wars in Britain and Ireland, where large numbers of Irish, Welsh, and Scots prisoners of war were sent as slaves to plantations in the West Indies, especially to Barbados and Jamaica.[15]\\r\\nThe practice of selling enemy combatants into slavery was begun in the American colonies during the Pequot War and King Philip's War. Military leader Benjamin Church spoke out at that time against enslavement of Indians. (Church's militia company was responsible for killing King Philip in August 1676.) In the summer of 1675, he described the enslavement of Indian combatants as \\"an action so hatefulthat (I) opposed it to the loss of the good will and respect of some that before were (my) good friends.\\" This said, Church was an owner of African slaves himself, like many Englishmen in the colony.[16]\\r\\nShips carrying captured war combatants began to leave New England ports during King Philip's War (1675-78) for places far away late in 1675 and, by the next summer, the shipping out of slaves had turned into a regular process which continued for the three years of the war. The policy concerning war enemies was that \\"no male captive above the age of fourteen years should reside in the colony.\\"[17]\\r\\nIt is estimated that at least a thousand New England Indian warriors were sold as slaves during King Philip's War, with over half of those coming from Plymouth. By the end of the war, villages that were once crowded Indian population centers were empty of inhabitants, due to the fact that the male Indian population had risen in armed war against their English neighbors.[18]\\r\\nIn the New England Colonies, the first settlements of Pilgrims and the other Puritans who came later taught their children how to read and write in order that they might read and study the Bible for themselves. Depending upon social and financial status, education was taught by the parents home-schooling their children, public grammar schools, and private governesses, which included subjects from reading and writing to Latin and Greek and more.","input":"What was the first successful english colony in the new world?"},{"output":"Rickey Medlocke","context":"Lynyrd Skynyrd is a Southern rock band from Jacksonville, Florida.

Lee High School.[2] After performing live for several years, the band recorded for the first time in 1971, when Junstrom and Burns were replaced by Greg T. Walker and Rickey Medlocke, respectively.[3] The following year, Walker was replaced by the band's original choice of bassist Leon Wilkeson, and Medlocke moved to third guitarist as Burns returned on drums.[4] Medlocke had left by the end of the year.[5] Billy Powell had also been added as the group's first keyboardist, having worked as a roadie since 1970.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly before recording began for the band's debut album (Pronounced 'L?h-'nrd 'Skin-'nrd), Wilkeson left Lynyrd Skynyrd and was replaced by Ed King.[7] Later during the sessions the bassist returned, with King subsequently taking up the role of third guitarist.[8] Burns remained for 1974's Second Helping, but left in January 1975 due to touring fatigue, with Artimus Pyle taking his place.[9] King left on May 26, 1975, two months after the release of Nuthin' Fancy.[10] He was replaced the following year by Steve Gaines, who was recommended by his sister Cassie Gaines after she had recently joined as one of the band's touring backing vocalists.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 20, 1977 ÿ three days after the release of the band's fifth studio album Street Survivors ÿ a chartered plane on which the members and crew were travelling crashed in Gillsburg, Mississippi.[13] Six people died in the accident, including band members Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines; many of the other passengers onboard were seriously injured, including Wilkeson who was left in a critical condition and reportedly declared dead three times.[14] The group disbanded after the crash.[13] In 1978, a collection of previously unreleased recordings from 1971 and 1972 was released as Skynyrd's First and...

On 29 May 1953, Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers confirmed to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. They were part of the ninth British expedition to Everest, led by John Hunt.\\r\\nHillary became interested in mountaineering while in secondary school. He made his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force as a navigator during World War II. Prior to the Everest expedition, Hillary had been part of the British reconnaissance expedition to the mountain in 1951 as well as an unsuccessful attempt to climb Cho Oyu in 1952. As part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition he reached the South Pole overland in 1958. He subsequently reached the North Pole, making him the first person to reach both poles and summit Everest.\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest, Hillary devoted most of his life to helping the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he founded. Through his efforts, many schools and hospitals were built in Nepal. From 1985 to 1988 he served as New Zealand's High Commissioner to India and Bangladesh and concurrently as Ambassador to Nepal. Hillary had numerous honours conferred upon him, including the Order of the Garter in 1995. Upon his death in 2008, he was given a state funeral in New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary was born to Percival Augustus and Gertrude (ne Clark) Hillary in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July 1919.[1][2] His family moved to Tuakau, south of Auckland, in 1920, after his father, who served at Gallipoli with the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment, was allocated land there.[2] His grandparents had emigrated from Yorkshire to northern Wairoa in the mid-19th century.[3]\\r\\nHillary was educated at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School.[2] He finished primary school two years early and at high school achieved average marks.[4] He was initially smaller than his peers and shy, but gained confidence after taking up boxing. He became interested in climbing when he was 16 following a school trip to Mount Ruapehu, after which he showed more interest in tramping than in studying and said he \\"wanted to see the world\\".[5][6]\\r\\nHe studied mathematics and science at Auckland University College and in 1939 completed his first major climb, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier, near Aoraki / Mount Cook in the Southern Alps.[2] He took up beekeeping with his brother,[1][7] which occupied him in the summer while he concentrated on climbing in winter.[8] His father was a beekeeper, and although Hillary's inclination was for climbing, he became a professional beekeeper.[9][10] He joined the Radiant Living Tramping Club, where a health philosophy developed by Herbert Sutcliffe was taught; tours with the club through the Waitakere Ranges further developed his love of the outdoors.[11]\\r\\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Hillary applied to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) but quickly withdrew the application, later writing that he was \\"harassed by my religious conscience\\".[12] In 1943, with the Japanese threat in the Pacific and the arrival of conscription, he joined the RNZAF as a navigator in No. 6 Squadron RNZAF and later No. 5 Squadron RNZAF on Catalina flying boats.[12][13] In 1945, he was sent to Fiji and to the Solomon Islands, where he was badly burnt in an accident.[12]\\r\\nIn January 1948, Hillary and others ascended the south ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest peak.[14] In 1951 he was part of a British reconnaissance expedition to Everest led by Eric Shipton,[15] before joining the successful British attempt of 1953. In 1952, Hillary and George Lowe were part of the British team led by Shipton, that attempted Cho Oyu.[16] After that attempt failed due to the lack of route from the Nepal side, Hillary and Lowe crossed the Nup La pass into Tibet and reached the old Camp II, on the northern side, where all the previous expeditions had camped.[17]\\r\\nIn 1949, the route to Everest was closed by Chinese-controlled Tibet. For the next several years, Nepal allowed only one or two expeditions per year.[19] A Swiss expedition (in which Tenzing took part) attempted to reach the summit in 1952, but was forced back by bad weather around 800 feet (240?m) below the summit.[20] In 1952 Hillary learned that he and Lowe had been invited by the Joint Himalayan Committee for the 1953 British attempt and immediately accepted.[21]\\r\\nShipton was named as leader but was replaced by Hunt. Hillary was immediately impressed by Hunt's energy and determination.[22] Hillary had intended to climb with Lowe, but Hunt named two teams for the assault: Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans; and Hillary and Tenzing.[23] Hillary, therefore, made a concerted effort to forge a working friendship with Tenzing.[22]\\r\\nThe Hunt expedition totalled over 400 people, including 362 porters, 20 Sherpa guides, and 10,000 pounds (4,500?kg) of baggage.[24][25] Lowe supervised the preparation of the Lhotse Face, a huge and steep ice face, for climbing. Hillary forged a route through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.[26][27]\\r\\nThe expedition set up base camp in March 1953 and, working slowly, set up its final camp at the South Col at 25,900 feet (7,890?m). On 26 May, Bourdillon and Evans attempted the climb but turned back when Evans' oxygen system failed. The pair had reached the South Summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit.[25][28] Hunt then directed Hillary and Tenzing to attempt the summit.[28]\\r\\nSnow and wind delayed them at the South Col for two days. They set out on 28 May with the support of Lowe, Alfred Gregory, and Ang Nyima.[29] The two pitched a tent at 27,900 feet (8,500?m) on 28 May, while their support group returned down the mountain.[30] On the following morning Hillary discovered that his boots had frozen solid outside the tent. He spent two hours warming them over a stove before he and Tenzing, wearing 30-pound (14?kg) packs, attempted the final ascent.[31] The final obstacle was the 40-foot (12?m) rock face now called \\"Hillary Step\\"; Hillary later wrote:\\r\\nI noticed a crack between the rock and the snow sticking to the East Face. I crawled inside and wriggled and jammed my way to the top?... Tenzing slowly joined me and we moved on. I chopped steps over bump after bump, wondering a little desperately where the top could be. Then I saw the ridge ahead dropped away to the north and above me on the right was a rounded snow dome. A few more whacks with my ice-axe and Tenzing and I stood on top of Everest.[32]\\r\\nTenzing later wrote that Hillary took the first step onto the summit and he followed. They reached Everest's 29,028?ft (8,848 m) summit?ÿ the highest point on earth?ÿ at 11:30?am.[1][33]\\r\\nThey spent about 15 minutes at the summit. Hillary took a photo of Tenzing posing with his ice-axe, but there is no photo of Hillary. BBC News attributed this to Tenzing's having never used a camera;[34][35] Tenzing's autobiography says that Hillary simply declined to have his picture taken. They also took photos looking down the mountain.[35]\\r\\nTenzing left chocolates at the summit as an offering, and Hillary left a cross given him by John Hunt.[36] Their descent was complicated by drifting snow which had covered their tracks. The first person they met was Lowe; Hillary said, \\"Well, George, we knocked the bastard off.\\"[6]\\r\\nThey returned to Kathmandu a few days later and learned that Hillary had already been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Hunt a Knight Bachelor.[37] News reached Britain on the day of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, and the press called it a coronation gift.[38] The 37 members of the party later received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal with mount everest expedition engraved along the rim.[39] In addition to the knighting of Hillary and Hunt, Tenzing?ÿ ineligible for knighthood as a Nepalese citizen?ÿ received the George Medal.[40][41][42] Tenzing also received the Star of Nepal from King Tribhuvan.[43]\\r\\nHillary climbed ten other peaks in the Himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960ÿ1961, and 1963ÿ1965. He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.[44]\\r\\nIn 1960 Hillary organized an expedition to search for the fabled abominable snowman.[45] Hillary was with the expedition for five months, although it lasted for ten.[46] No evidence of Yetis was found, instead footprints and tracks were proven to be from other causes. During the expedition, Hillary travelled to remote temples which contained \\"Yeti scalps\\"; however after bringing back three relics, two were shown to be from bears and one from a goat antelope.[47][48] Hillary said after the expedition: \\"The yeti is not a strange, superhuman creature as has been imagined. We have found rational explanations for most yeti phenomena\\".[49]\\r\\nIn 1962 he was a guest on the television game show What's My Line?; he stumped the panel, comprising Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, Bennett Cerf, and Merv Griffin.[50] In 1977, he led a jetboat expedition, titled \\"Ocean to Sky\\", from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source.[51] From 1977 to 1979 he commentated aboard Antarctic sightseeing flights operated by Air New Zealand.[52] In 1985, he accompanied Neil Armstrong in a small twin-engined ski plane over the Arctic Ocean and landed at the North Pole. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest.[53][54][55][56] This accomplishment inspired generations of explorers to compete over what later was defined as Three Poles Challenge. In January 2007, Hillary travelled to Antarctica as part of a delegation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Scott Base.[57][58][59]\\r\\nOn 6 June 1953 Hillary was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal the same year.[60] On 6 February 1987, he was the fourth appointee to the Order of New Zealand.[61] He was also awarded the Polar Medal in 1958 for his part in the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition,[62][63] the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu, 1st Class of the Kingdom of Nepal in 1953, and the Coronation Medal in 1975.[64] On 22 April 1995 Hillary was appointed Knight Companion of The Most Noble Order of the Garter.[65][66] On 17 June 2004 Hillary was awarded Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.[67] The Government of India conferred on him its second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, posthumously, in 2008.[68]\\r\\nTo mark the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest, the Nepalese government conferred honorary citizenship upon Hillary at a special Golden Jubilee celebration in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was the first foreign national to receive that honour.[69][10]\\r\\nSince 1992, New Zealand's $5 note has featured Hillary's portrait, making him the only living person not a current head of state ever to appear on a New Zealand banknote. In giving his permission, Hillary insisted that Aoraki / Mount Cook rather than Mount Everest be used as the backdrop.[70][71]\\r\\nAnnual Reader's Digest polls from 2005 to 2007 named Hillary as \\"New Zealand's most trusted individual\\".[73][74]\\r\\nHillary's favoured New Zealand charity was the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre, of which he was patron for 35 years.[75] He was particularly keen on how this organisation introduced young New Zealanders to the outdoors in a very similar way to his first experience of a school trip to Mt Ruapehu at the age of 16. A 2.3-metre (7.5?ft) bronze statue of Hillary was erected outside The Hermitage Hotel at Mount Cook Village; it was unveiled by Hillary himself in 2003.[76] Various streets, institutions and organisations around New Zealand and abroad are named after him ÿ for example, the Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate in Otara, which was established by Hillary in 2001.[77]\\r\\nTwo Antarctic features are named after Hillary. The Hillary Coast is a section of coastline south of Ross Island and north of the Shackleton Coast.[78] The Hillary Canyon, an undersea feature in the Ross Sea, appears on the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, published by the International Hydrographic Organization.[79]\\r\\nHillary married Louise Mary Rose on 3 September 1953, soon after the ascent of Everest; he admitted he was terrified of proposing to her and relied on her mother to propose on his behalf.[7][8][80] They had three children: Peter (born 1954), Sarah (born 1955) and Belinda (1959ÿ1975).[1][28] In 1975 while en route to join Hillary in the village of Phaphlu, where he was helping to build a hospital, Louise and Belinda were killed in a plane crash near Kathmandu airport shortly after take-off.[7] In 1989 he married June Mulgrew, the widow of his close friend Peter Mulgrew, who died on Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979.[8][81]\\r\\nHis son Peter Hillary also became a climber, summiting Everest in 1990. In May 2002 Peter climbed Everest as part of a 50th anniversary celebration; Jamling Tenzing Norgay (son of Tenzing who had died in 1986) was also part of the expedition.[82] Hillary is also survived by six grandchildren.[83]\\r\\nHillary's home for most of his life was a property on Remuera Road in Auckland City,[84] where he enjoyed reading adventure and science fiction novels in his retirement.[84] He also built a bach at Whites Beach,[85] one of Auckland's west coast beaches in the former Waitakere City, between Anawhata and North Piha;[86][87] a friend called it Hillary's place of solace, where he could escape media attention.[85]\\r\\nThe Hillary family has had a connection with the west coast of Auckland since 1925, when Louise's father built a bach at Anawhata.[88] The family donated land at Whites Beach that is now crossed by trampers on the Hillary Trail, named for Edmund.[89] Hillary said of the area: \\"That is the thing that international travel brings home to me ÿ it's always good to be going home. This is the only place I want to live in; this is the place I want to see out my days.\\"[90]\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest he devoted much of his life to helping the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he founded in 1960[91] and led until his death in 2008. Through his efforts many schools and hospitals were built in this remote region of the Himalayas. He was the Honorary President of the American Himalayan Foundation, a United States non-profit body that helps improve the ecology and living conditions in the Himalayas. He was also the Honorary President of Mountain Wilderness, an international NGO dedicated to the worldwide protection of mountains.[92]\\r\\nHillary took part in the 1975 New Zealand general election, as a member of the \\"Citizens for Rowling\\" campaign. His involvement in this campaign was seen as precluding his nomination as Governor-General;[93] the position was offered to Keith Holyoake in 1977. In 1985, Hillary was appointed New Zealand High Commissioner to India (concurrently High Commissioner to Bangladesh and Ambassador to Nepal) and spent four and a half years based in New Delhi.[94]\\r\\nIn 1975, Hillary served as a vice president for the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand,[95] a national pro-choice advocacy group.[96] He was also a patron of REPEAL, an organization seeking repeal of the restrictive Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977.[95]\\r\\nOn 22 April 2007, while on a trip to Kathmandu, Hillary suffered a fall, and was hospitalised after returning to New Zealand.[97] On 11 January 2008 he died of heart failure at Auckland City Hospital.[98] Flags were lowered to half-mast on New Zealand public buildings and at Scott Base in Antarctica,[99] and Prime Minister Helen Clark called Hillary's death a \\"profound loss to New Zealand\\".[100]\\r\\nOn 21 January, Hillary's casket was taken into Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland, to lie in state.[101] A state funeral was held on 22 January 2008,[102] after which his body was cremated. On 29 February 2008 most of his ashes were scattered in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf per his desire.[103] The remainder went to a Nepalese monastery near Everest; a plan to scatter them on the summit was cancelled in 2010.[104]\\r\\nIn January 2008, Lukla Airport, in Lukla, Nepal, was renamed to TenzingÿHillary Airport in recognition of their promotion of its construction.[105][106] On 2 April 2008, a service of thanksgiving in Hillary's honour at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle was attended by Queen Elizabeth, New Zealand dignitaries including Prime Minister Helen Clark, and members of Hillary's and Norgay's families; Gurkha soldiers from Nepal stood guard outside the ceremony.[107][108] In October 2008, it was announced that future rugby test matches between England and New Zealand would be played for the Hillary Shield.[109] In 2009 the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in New Zealand?ÿ formerly the Young New Zealanders' Challenge?ÿ was renamed \\"The Duke of Edinburgh's Hillary Award\\".[110] On 5 November 2008, a commemorative set of five stamps was issued by New Zealand Post.[111][112]\\r\\nThere have been many calls for lasting tributes to Hillary. The first major public tribute has been by way of the \\"Summits for Ed\\" tribute tour organised by the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation.[113] This tribute tour went from Bluff at the bottom of the South Island to Cape Reinga at the tip of the North Island, visiting 39 towns and cities along the way. In each venue, school children and members of the public were invited to join together to climb a significant hill or site in their area to show their respect for Hillary. The public were also invited to bring small rocks or pebbles that had special significance to them, that would be included in a memorial to Hillary at the base of Mt Ruapehu, in the grounds of the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre. Funds donated during the tour are used by the foundation to sponsor young New Zealanders on outdoor courses. Over 8,000 persons attended these \\"Summit\\" climbs between March and May 2008.[114]\\r\\nThe tribute song \\"Hillary 88\\", by the New Zealand duo The Kiwis, is the official world memorial song for Hillary, with the endorsement of Lady Hillary.[115]\\r\\nA four-day track in the Waitakere Ranges, along Auckland's west coast, is named the Hillary Trail,[116] in honour of Hillary.[89] Hillary's father-in-law, Jim Rose, who had built a bach at Anawhata in 1925, wrote in his 1982 history of Anawhata Beach, \\"My family look forward to the time when we will be able to walk from Huia to Muriwai on public walking tracks like the old-time Maori could do\\".[88][117] Hillary loved the area, and had his own bach near Anawhata. The track was opened on 11 January 2010, the second anniversary of Hillary's death.[98][118] Rose Track, descending from Anawhata Road to Whites Beach, is named after the Rose family.[90][119]\\r\\nThe South Ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest mountain, was renamed Hillary Ridge on 18 August 2011. Hillary and three other climbers were the first party to successfully climb the ridge in 1948.[120] In September 2013 the Government of Nepal proposed naming a 7,681 metres (25,200?ft) mountain in Nepal Hillary Peak in his honour.[121] After the New Horizons mission discovered a mountain range on Pluto on 14 July 2015, it was informally named Hillary Montes (Hillary Mountains) by NASA.[122]\\r\\nThe Sir Edmund Hillary Mountain Legacy Medal, awarded by the Nepalese NGO Mountain Legacy \\"for remarkable service in the conservation of culture and nature in mountainous regions\\" was inaugurated in 2003, with the approval of Sir Edmund Hillary. A bronze bust of Hillary (circa 1953) by Ophelia Gordon Bell is in the Te Papa museum in Wellington, New Zealand.[123] The Sir Edmund Hillary Archive was added to the UNESCO Memory of the world archive in 2013,[124] it is currently held by Auckland War Memorial Museum.[125]","input":"Who were the first climbers of mount everest?"},{"output":"in 2012","context":"Coordinates: 532428.1N 25921.3W? / ?53.407806N 2.989250W? / 53.407806; -2.989250\\r\\nThe Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) is a non-departmental public body of the Home Office of the United Kingdom. The DBS enables organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors to make safer recruitment decisions by identifying candidates who may be unsuitable for certain work, especially that involving children or vulnerable adults, and provides wider access to criminal record information through its disclosure service for England and Wales.\\r\\nThe DBS was formed in 2012 by merging the functions of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) and the Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. DBS started operating on 1 December 2012.[1] It operates from Liverpool[2] and Darlington. Its equivalent agencies are Disclosure Scotland in Scotland and Access Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland.\\r\\nIt is a legal requirement in the UK for regulated activity employers to refer safeguarding concerns to the DBS. It is an offence for any person who has been barred by the DBS to work or apply to work with the group (children or adults) from which they are barred.[3] It is also an offence for an employer to knowingly employ a barred person in regulated activity with the group from which they are barred.\\r\\nOn 17 June 2013, a DBS update service was launched, intended to improve the ease of applying for criminal record checks and create significant savings.\\r\\nOn 1st February 2018, the National Audit Office published an investigation report that was highly critical of the DBS.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Home Office launched a programme to increase the efficiency of safeguarding services. Key aims of the programme were to reduce the cost of running the disclosure service, through customers using a new and cheaper update service rather than continuing to use existing types of disclosure certificates. The Home Office expected 2.8 million paying users to be using the new update service by 2017ÿ18, but it was not market tested and the actual number of users is around one million.\\r\\nAccording to the National Audit Office investigation, the modernisation programme is now running three and a half years late and expected costs have increased by S229 million. DBS is currently negotiating with its contractor, Tata Consultancy Services, over the delays.\\r\\nThe modernisation programme and the update service were expected to increase the ease and frequency with which people were checked, thereby improving safeguarding. But the Home Office and DBS do not know how many people have been prevented from working with children or vulnerable adults through use of this information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn organisation which is entitled to ask exempted questions (under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974) must register with the DBS, or a registered DBS Umbrella Body before they can request a DBS check on an applicant. The applicant applies to the DBS with their application countersigned by the DBS Registered Organisation or Umbrella Body. The applicant's criminal record is then accessed from the Police National Computer (PNC), as well as checked, if appropriate, against lists of people considered unsuitable to work with children and vulnerable people maintained by the DBS (formerly maintained by the Independent Safeguarding Authority. A Copy of the completed certificate is sent to the applicant's home address.[4]\\r\\nIf an individual or organisation has safeguarding concerns regarding a member of staff, they can make a safeguarding referral to the DBS who will work with multiple agencies to assess whether that individual should be Barred from working in regulated activity with children and/or vulnerable groups.[5]\\r\\nThe Criminal Records Bureau was established under Part V of the Police Act 1997 and was launched in March 2002, following public concern about the safety of children, young people and vulnerable adults. It was found that the British police forces did not have adequate capability or resources to routinely process and fulfil the large number of criminal record checks requested in a timely fashion, so a dedicated agency was set up to administer this function.[6]\\r\\nEmployers and temporary staff agencies have bemoaned the time it takes for a worker to be cleared by the DBS and in an effort to cut waiting times the government allowed the establishment of \\"Adult First\\" .[citation needed]\\r\\nIn May 2002, the Department for Education began maintaining a list of individuals who are not suitable to work with children. This list was originally named List 99, later named the ISA Children's Barred List (maintained by the Independent Safeguarding Authority) and finally, the DBS Children's Barred List (maintained by the Disclosure and Barring Service.[7]\\r\\nUnder the Care Standards Act (2000), the Department for Health introduced an adult version of List 99 named 'POVA first' on 26 July 2004,[8] this was later renamed 'ISA Adult First' and finally; 'DBS Adult First'. The Adult first and List 99 services allow registered bodies (when eligible) to check whether an applicant appears on the DBS Adults' or Children's Barred List through the online checking system, this takes around two working days to turn around.[9] If the check is clean the organisation may provisionally employ the applicant, subject to an increased level in supervision, until the return by post of the full disclosure.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe process by which the DBS provides criminal record data is called DBS Certificate or a DBS check (previously CRB check). There are three levels of DBS checks, Standard, Enhanced and Enhanced with barred list checks (for Basic Disclosures, see Disclosure Scotland). DBS checks cannot be obtained by members of the public directly but are only available to organisations and only for those professions, offices, employments, work and occupations listed in the Exceptions Order (1975) to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974[10] as amended by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.[11] On 17 June 2013, a DBS update service was launched, intended to improve the ease of applying for criminal record checks and create significant savings. At a fee of S13 a year, applicants may use a certificate more than once within a sector where the disclosure level, workforce details, barring list checks and volunteer status are the same; an employer with consent to run a DBS update check can check that the existing certificate is up to date, and should check the applicant's identity and the certificate's authenticity. In January 2018 \\"Basic\\" DBS checks were introduced which will disclose details of any cautions or convictions deemend to be unspent in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.[12]\\r\\nThe basic DBS check will disclose any cautions, reprimands, warnings and convictions deemed to be unspent according to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. This service is provided by DBS in England and Wales and Disclosure Scotland for applicants in Scotland. Applications can also be done online. An employer's reference to \\"a DBS check\\" could be taken as a requirement for a standard or enhanced check, which meant the disclosure of cautions and convictions, even once spent. However, with the introduction of the basic check, employers will now have to specify which check is required when advertising a job. The aim is that this service will reduce the need for unnecessary and ineligible Standard or Enhanced checks. You can apply for one through \\"Responsible Organisations\\" which is a list of organisations and websites who will apply for a check with you.[13]\\r\\nThe standard DBS check is primarily for positions of high responsibility (for example, accountancy and security).[14] Standard certificates reveal details of any convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings the applicant has received, that do not qualify for filtering. A standard check may only be applied for if the applicant's job role is specified in the Police Act 1997, as amended by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.[15]\\r\\nEnhanced DBS checks are for positions involving certain activities such as teaching children or treating adults and can also be obtained for certain other professions (for example, judicial appointments, RSPCA officers). An enhanced check may only be applied for if the applicant's job role is specified in both the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exception) order 1975 and the Police Act 1997.[14]\\r\\nIn addition to the information provided on a Standard certificate, the Enhanced certificate involves an additional check with the police,[15] who check if any other information is held on file that may be relevant (for instance, information that has not led to a criminal conviction but may indicate a danger to vulnerable groups). The police decide what (if any) additional information will be added to the certificate using the Quality Assurance Framework.[16]\\r\\nThe involvement of local police forces can mean an enhanced check may take significantly longer than a standard check to be completed.[original research?]\\r\\nThis includes all that Enhanced certificate does, plus a check of the appropriate DBS Barred List. There are two DBS Barred Lists: one for adults, and one for children. The lists contain information on whether the applicant is barred from working with either of the two groups.[15] An individual may only be checked against one or both barred lists if their job role is classified as a \\"Regulated Activity\\" with children and/or adults under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. Other roles from which they might be barred include work within people's homes, or areas such as postal work, in which they would have access to personal documents.\\r\\nAs of 29?May?2013[update], the DBS began to \\"filter\\" certain criminal information from a DBS certificate if it met the guidelines laid out in The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 (Amendment) (England and Wales) Order 2013[17]\\r\\nThe DBS work to a number of standards for the criminal record checking service and barring case accuracy.\\r\\nPerformance service standards are also agreed between the DBS and Police disclosure units.\\r\\nThe CRB had been due to partner with the ISA in administering the newly created Vetting and Barring Scheme from 2009. This was suspended in 2010 pending a review following the 2010 General Election.\\r\\nThis review was published in February 2011, making recommendations for the merger of the Criminal Records Bureau and Independent Safeguarding Authority into one new non-departmental public body, the Disclosure and Barring Service, responsible for barring individuals and completing criminal record checks. Under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, the DBS does not require registration, nor are any details retained on a database.\\r\\nThe procedures of the CRB were tightened following the Soham murders trial. Ian Huntley, a former caretaker, was found guilty of murdering two girls from a Cambridgeshire primary school in 2002. Huntley had been suspected of a string of offences including rape, indecent assault and burglary. His only conviction before the murders was for riding an uninsured and unlicensed motorcycle, but a burglary charge had remained on file. In January 2006, following controversies resulting from cases where staff had been hired by schools before a full CRB check had been carried out, the Department for Education and Skills stated: \\"Employers should obtain a CRB Enhanced Disclosure in respect of all teachers they recruit before the person is placed in a school.\\" Huntley had been hired in November 2001, before the CRB came into force.[18][19][20]\\r\\nSociologist Frank Furedi has stated that CRB checks cannot provide a \\"cast-iron guarantee that children will be safe with a particular adult\\", and that their use has created an atmosphere of suspicion and is \\"poisoning\\" relationships between the generations, with many ordinary parents finding themselves regarded as \\"potential child abusers\\".[6] The restrictions imposed by the CRB check process have contributed to a shortage of adult volunteers in organizations such as Girlguiding UK.[6]\\r\\nIn 2009 the CRB's Enhanced Disclosure was criticised for including details of any minor contact an individual has had with the police, even where no formal action was taken against them.[23]","input":"When was the disclosure and barring service introduced?"},{"output":"Jeanne Calment","context":"This is a list of the 100 verified oldest people.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, Rolling Stone magazine editor and publisher Jann S. Wenner, attorney Allen Grubman, and record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of Bill Haley and American Bandstand), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.[citation needed]\\r\\nCleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \\"rock and roll\\" and heavily promoted the new genreand that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 80s, including artist David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush among many others.[2] Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.\\r\\nCivic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 USA Today poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland. \\"The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly,\\" wrote Peter Guralnick, author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.[3]\\r\\nCleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As The Plain Dealer music critic Michael Norman noted, \\"It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money.\\" Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, \\"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place,\\" but then added, \\"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\\"\\r\\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium.\\r\\nAt one point in the planning phase when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200?ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162?ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Billy Joel, Sam Phillips, Ruth Brown, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking.\\r\\nThe museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.\\r\\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.[4]\\r\\nSince 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986ÿ92, 1994ÿ96, 1998ÿ2008, 2010ÿ11, 2014, 2016 and 2017); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012 and 2015). Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.[5]\\r\\nThe 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a publicÿprivate partnership between the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.[6]\\r\\nMillions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.[7]\\r\\nThere are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm & blues and folk, country and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London and Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, Atlantic Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.[8]\\r\\nThe first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \\"Backstage Stories.\\" The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips and the evolution of audio technology.[9]\\r\\nVisitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \\"The Power of Rock Experience,\\" which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies.[10] Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.[11][12]\\r\\nFinally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, Bruce Springsteen, Women Who Rock, and the Rolling Stones.\\r\\nDesigned by I. M. Pei and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of bold geometric forms and dynamic cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \\"tent\\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\\r\\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a caf.\\r\\n\\"In designing this building,\\" Pei said, \\"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\\" [13]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\\r\\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 ÿ 1969. It included artifacts from numerous artists, including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, the Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as artifacts related to the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock.\\r\\nThat exhibit was followed by Elvis is in the Building, an exhibit about the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career.[14] Next, the museum curated Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by Rock Style, an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, from Ray Charles to David Bowie and from Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, Rock Style traveled to other museums in the U.S.\\r\\nOther temporary exhibits have included Lennon: His Life and Work, which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2 and then Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection. A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.[15]\\r\\nOther large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash), the Doors (Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors), the Who's Tommy (Tommy: The Amazing Journey), and Bruce Springsteen (From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine Rolling Stone.[16]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th anniversary, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, and John Mellencamp.\\r\\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford,[17] and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.[18][19]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll. Every February, the museum celebrates Black History Month[20] by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.\\r\\nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.\\r\\nA similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\\r\\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008),[21] Janis Joplin (2009),[22] Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011),[23] and Chuck Berry (2012).[24]\\r\\n Hall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \\"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\\", created an unordered list of \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\".[25][26] The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.[27] It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The Beatles with seven songs was the most represented on the 500ÿsong list. The oldest song on the list is \\"Wabash Cannonball\\", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 155 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \\"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" and My Chemical Romance's \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\", both released in 2006.[28] The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 655ÿsong list, with eight songs each.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Simon & Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony & the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.[29][30][31]\\r\\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. Generally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters. The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences, John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\\r\\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \\"Performers\\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.[32]\\r\\nIn 2012, six additional groups, the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets, were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \\"There was a lot of discussion about this,\\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \\"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question ÿ it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\\"[33]\\r\\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily country, folk, jazz, and blues, whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musicians Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \\"rock era\\".\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Non-Performers\\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters and music journalists. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.[34]\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Sidemen\\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \\"Award for Musical Excellence\\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \\"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\\"[35]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\\r\\nThe Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\\r\\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.\\r\\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.[36][37][38]\\r\\nThe most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder Jann Wenner (co-founder and editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \\"At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\\"[39] Sister Rosetta Tharpe is often considered \\"The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll\\",[40][41] but was not chosen for induction until 2017. Also, the influential soul/funk group Tower of Power has not yet been honored. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the \\"Hall of Lame\\".[42]\\r\\nThere is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of The New York Times wrote:\\r\\n\\"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders ÿ and committee members say they want to keep it that way.\\"[43]\\r\\nJon Landau, the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. \\"We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.\\"[43]\\r\\nAccording to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all.[39] The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres.[44] According to author Brett Milano, \\"entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music.\\"[45] In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous hip hop artists have been inducted, including Tupac Shakur (class of 2017), N.W.A (class of 2016) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (class of 2007).[46]\\r\\nAnother criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.[47] A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.[47] The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.[48]\\r\\nMembers of the British punk rock band The Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \\"a piss stain\\" and \\"urine in wine\\".[49]\\r\\nIn BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, the singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \\"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\\"[50][51] In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%.[52] Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which only 61 have been women, none of which has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.[53]\\r\\n2016 inductee Steve Miller voiced a litany of criticisms directed at the hall, both during his induction speech and, especially, in interviews after it. His complaints included a lack of female inductees, not enough support by the hall for music education, and treatment of inductees at the award ceremony.[54]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article claiming that the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say \\"Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act.\\"[46]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation would later deny fixing the vote, although they did not deny that late votes were received, saying, \\"No. There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\\"[55] The Dave Clark Five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.[56]\\r\\nIn June 2007, Monkee Peter Tork complained to the New York Post that Wenner had blackballed the Monkees, commenting:\\r\\n[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, 'What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.' [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.\\r\\nIn a Facebook post, fellow Monkee Michael Nesmith stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and further stated: \\"I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\\"[57]\\r\\nVarious magazines and news outlets, such as Time,[58] NPR radio,[59] The Christian Science Monitor,[60] Goldmine magazine,[61][62] Yahoo Music[63] and MSNBC [64] have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","input":"When did the rock and roll hall of fame begin?"},{"output":"Ahmad Saeed","context":"The IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper is a football award given annually since 1987 to the most outstanding goalkeeper of the year as voted by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS).[1] The votes are cast by IFFHS's editorial staff as well as experts from different continents.

The match took place at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada, on August 26, 2017 at the light-middleweight weight class (154?lbs; 69.9?kg). It was scheduled for twelve rounds.\\r\\nMayweather extended his professional boxing undefeated streak to 50 victories and 0 defeats (50ÿ0), surpassing the 49ÿ0 record of Hall of Famer Rocky Marciano by defeating McGregor by technical knockout (TKO) in the 10th round.[4] Mayweather's guaranteed disclosed paycheck was $100,000,000 and McGregor's guaranteed disclosed paycheck was $30,000,000.[5][6] However, the purse for the two fighters was expected to be substantially higher for each, with Mayweather reportedly earning over $300,000,000 from the fight and McGregor earning over $100,000,000.[7][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his successful UFC mixed martial arts career McGregor maintained an interest in boxing and entertained the idea of a \\"money fight\\" with Mayweather.[10] Mayweather reportedly talked to Freddie Roach to train McGregor for the fight in case it would happen.[11] UFC president Dana White dismissed the rumors of a fight with Mayweather on The Dan Patrick Show, stating that Mayweather would have to contact him since McGregor was under contract with the UFC.[12] White even went as far as stating, \\"Heres what I think the chances are [of the fight happening]: About the same of me being the backup quarterback for Brady on Sunday,\\" referring to Super Bowl LI.[13] In January 2017, it was reported that the two parties had entered an \\"exploratory phase\\" in negotiating a potential match between Mayweather and McGregor. On The Herd with Colin Cowherd, White openly offered to pay Mayweather $25 million to hold the proposed bout during a UFC event. He also predicted that pay-per-view viewership of the hypothetical bout could possibly rival Mayweather vs. Pacquiao.[14]\\r\\nOn March 7, 2017, Mayweather called upon McGregor to \\"sign the paper\\" and \\"make it happen\\", arguing that \\"if Conor McGregor really wants this fight to happen, stop blowing smoke up everybody's ass.\\"[15] On March 10, 2017, Mayweather stated that only a fight with McGregor would make him come out of retirement.[16] On March 16, 2017, Dana White backpedaled on his stance against a MayweatherÿMcGregor bout and said that he would not deprive McGregor of a massive payday.[17][18] On May 18, 2017, McGregor reportedly agreed to all of Mayweather's updated terms and signed the contract.[19] The official confirmation of the fight was made on June 14.[20] An international press tour was held from July 11ÿ14.[21]\\r\\nIn July 2017, IBF junior lightweight champion Gervonta Davis was reported to be going to participate in a co-main event.[22] On July 19, additional undercard details were released.[23] By that time, three names had been confirmed on the undercard, including British amateur boxer Savannah Marshall, who signed up earlier in the year with Mayweather Promotions, and Badou Jack, who stepped up to fight at light heavyweight.[24] On July 26, 2017, it was announced that former welterweight titleholder Shawn Porter would be headlining the preliminary card, facing Thomas Dulorme.[25][26] On August 17, Porter pulled out of the fight due to personal reasons, including a death in the family. He was replaced by Cuban boxer Yordenis Ugs.[27] On July 29, it was reported that Gervonta Davis would defend his IBF junior lightweight title against former WBO champion Roman 'Rocky' Martinez.[28] Martnez was dropped due to not having enough time to make the 130 pound [59?kg] limit.[29] Instead Davis has been rescheduled to fight unbeaten prospect Francisco Fonseca.[30] On August 9, 2017, it was announced that Nathan Cleverly would defend his WBA light heavyweight title against Money Team fighter Badou Jack.[31][32]\\r\\nA mural was painted in McGregor's Dublin training facility, Straight Blast Gym, depicting McGregor hitting Mayweather with a left-handed punch.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the fight was televised via Showtime pay-per-view, available through both traditional television providers and various digital services, including the Showtime PPV website and apps, and UFC.tv. Fathom Events organized public screenings at venues such as cinemas.[34][35][36] On July 10, 2017, it was announced that pricing for the PPV in the U.S. would mirror that of Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, being set at US$89.95 (with an additional $10 charge for high definition).[37]\\r\\nThe fight was called by Showtime's lead commentary team of Mauro Ranallo (play-by-play), Al Bernstein (color), and Paulie Malignaggi (color), along with ringside reporter Jim Gray.[38] Showtime produced a four-part documentary series, All Access: Mayweather vs. McGregor, focusing on the preparations for the fight.[39] Fox Sports (the television rightsholder of the UFC) provided shoulder programming for the fight, including coverage of the press tour on UFC Tonight, as well as a pre-show and preliminary card on Fox and Fox Deportes.[37]\\r\\nDue to the high demand, a large number of television providers, as well as UFC.tv, experienced technical issues with their carriage of the PPV, including errors, buffering and low video quality. The main event was delayed by an hour from its projected start time in order to address these problems. Following the fight, a class-action lawsuit was proposed in Oregon against Showtime Networks for unlawful trading practices and unjust enrichment, alleging that the network knowingly advertised a level of quality it was unable to deliver with the amount of bandwidth it allocated for the PPV stream.[40][41] Showtime and the UFC stated that they were investigating their respective customer complaints, and would issue refunds on a case-by-case basis.[42]\\r\\nSky Sports Box Office held broadcasting rights to the fight in McGregor's native Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Although it was initially believed that the price would match that of the U.S. PPV, the price was set at ?24.95 (S19.95).[43] The fight was called for Sky Sports by Johnny Nelson and Carl Froch, joined by British MMA fighter and UFC analyst Dan Hardy.[44] British radio rights were held by the BBC, with Mike Costello and Steve Bunce on commentary for BBC Radio 5 Live.[45]\\r\\nIn Hispanic America, the fight aired on Fox Premium Action.[46] In Brazil, the event aired on Globosat-owned Combate.[47]\\r\\nAs with Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, it was expected that many viewers would seek unauthorized streams of the fight due to the high cost of the PPV. Showtime successfully received a preliminary injunction against the registrant of a group of 44 websites who planned to illegally stream the fight in violation of its copyrights, and all parties in active concert or participation with them.[48][49]\\r\\nIt was estimated that nearly 2.93 million viewers illegally streamed the fight, on video streaming websites and social media channels such as Facebook, YouTube and Periscope.[50][51]\\r\\nMayweather was expected to earn at least $100 million, increasing up to four times that amount upon the event achieving all its metrics.[52] McGregor was expected to earn $75 million, but both men signed NDAs barring them from publicly communicating the financial details.[53] According to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, Mayweather would earn a guaranteed purse of $100 million and McGregor was guaranteed $30 million.[54]\\r\\nIn a Q&A session in Glasgow in September 2017, McGregor revealed, had he been disqualified, he would have been fined $10 million. The referee also warned him, had he lifted a leg, he would have not been warned and got a straight point deduction.[55]\\r\\nOn August 23, 2017, the WBC unveiled a special belt that would go to the winner of the fight, the \\"Money Belt\\"; it is made from Italian-made alligator leather and encrusted with 3.3 pounds (1.5?kg) of 24-karat gold, 3,360 diamonds, 600 sapphires, and 300 emeralds.[56]\\r\\nOn August 16, 2017, the officials were named for the fight:[57]\\r\\nBoth athletes initially agreed to box in 10-ounce (285 g) gloves per Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) rules which require 10-ounce (285 g) gloves for boxing matches contracted over 147 pounds [67?kg] (the fight is contracted at 154 pounds [70?kg]).[58] McGregor wanted 8-ounce (225 g) gloves and Mayweather agreed, and both athletes submitted formal requests to box in 8-ounce (225 g) gloves, which was granted by the NSAC.[58]\\r\\nExperts expected that more money would be bet on the fight than any other boxing match in history; estimates ranged up to $85 million in bets.[59][60] There were six separate $1 million bets on Mayweather in Las Vegas bookmakers, but a large majority of bets overall were on the underdog, McGregor.[60]\\r\\nNevada State Athletic Commission announced the live gate for the event was $55,414,865.79 from 13,094 tickets sold and 137 complimentary tickets given out. This was far less than the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight which grossed $72 million from a paid attendance of 16,219 in 2015, despite claims from Ellerbe and Mayweather that it did more than $80 million.[61]\\r\\nSky Sports announced the fight garnered over a million PPV buys in the UK and grossed in excess of S20 million, surpassing the record set in April 2017 when Anthony Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko in front of 90,000 at the Wembley Stadium. This also meant the fight generated more buys in the UK than Mayweather-Pacquiao which took place in 2015.[62]\\r\\nShowtime Sports Stephen Espinoza told the LA Times the fight was expected to generate around 4.4 million domestic buys, which would fall just short of the 4.6 million record which was set by Mayweather-Pacquiao.[63]\\r\\nAt the weigh-in, Mayweather tipped the scales at 149.5?lbs, with McGregor at 153?lbs.[64] Mayweather and McGregor entered the ring following the Irish and American national anthems; the Irish singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Imelda May performed on behalf of Conor McGregor,[65] followed by the American singer-songwriter and actress Demi Lovato, who was personally chosen by Mayweather.[66]\\r\\nMayweather was widely expected to dominate the fight early, but McGregor started strong and was ahead on the score cards for the first few rounds, due in part to Mayweather using the rope-a-dope technique liberally in the early stages.[67] As the fight progressed, McGregor weakened. In rounds 9 and 10, Mayweather landed a series of punches to McGregor's face, and referee Robert Byrd eventually called the fight in favor of Mayweather after McGregor failed to defend himself.[68]\\r\\nAfter the match Mayweather stated that he had expected McGregor to be a fast starter, and had allowed him to deliver his heavy blows early.[69][70] McGregor on the other hand was disappointed by what he saw as an early stoppage, but respected the referee's decision. Former boxers such as George Foreman and Evander Holyfield expressed their impression regarding McGregor's boxing skills and the competitiveness of the fight,[71][72] with Foreman claiming that experts who criticized the fight \\"should apologize. It was competitive\\".[73] Mike Tyson gave McGregor an \\"A grade\\" for his performance, stating he was impressed.[74] The fight was lauded for its entertaining and exciting nature, especially when compared to Mayweather's most recent bouts.[75]\\r\\nMayweather announced in his post-fight interview that he had fought his final boxing match, and would retire from the sport. McGregor said in his post-fight interview that he would be willing to box again, and that he would return to mixed martial arts and the UFC.[citation needed]\\r\\nDavis failed to make weight during the August 25 weigh in, forcing the IBF to strip him of the title. The title was declared vacant, but would be still up for grabs if Fonseca secures victory.[76] Davis would go on to win by KO in the eighth round. Cleverly lost his WBA light heavyweight title to Jack in a one-sided bout which ended when the referee stopped the fight in the fifth.[77] Cleverly retired after the fight.[78]","input":"What weight is conor mcgregor and mayweather fighting at?"},{"output":"Douglas","context":"in the British Isles, Western Europe\\r\\nThe Isle of Man (Manx: Ellan Vannin [??l??n ?van?n]), also known simply as Mann (/m?n/; Manx: Mannin [?man?n]), is a self-governing British Crown dependency in the Irish Sea between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann and is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Defence is the responsibility of the United Kingdom.\\r\\nRanked by the World Bank as the 5th richest nation in the world by GDP per capita,[6] the largest sectors are insurance and eGaming with 17% of GNP each, followed by ICT and banking with 9% each.[7]\\r\\nThe island has been inhabited since before 6500 BC. Gaelic cultural influence began in the 5th century and the Manx language, a branch of the Gaelic languages, emerged. In 627, Edwin of Northumbria conquered the Isle of Man along with most of Mercia. In the 9th century, Norsemen established the Kingdom of the Isles. Magnus III, King of Norway, was also known as King of Mann and the Isles between 1099 and 1103.[8]\\r\\nIn 1266, the island became part of Scotland under the Treaty of Perth, after being ruled by Norway. After a period of alternating rule by the kings of Scotland and England, the island came under the feudal lordship of the English Crown in 1399. The lordship revested into the British Crown in 1765, but the island never became part of the 18th century Kingdom of Great Britain or its successors the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the present-day United Kingdom: it retained its status as an internally self-governing Crown dependency.\\r\\nThe Isle of Man parliament, Tynwald,?became in 1881 the first national legislative body in the world to give women the right to vote in a general election, but this excluded married women.[9][10]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Isle of Man was the first whole nation to be awarded biosphere reserve status by UNESCO.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manx name of the Isle of Man is Ellan Vannin: ellan (Manx pronunciation:?[?l??n]) is a Manx word meaning 'island'; Mannin (IPA:?[man?n]) appears in the genitive case as Vannin (IPA:?[van?n]), with initial consonant mutation, hence Ellan Vannin, \\"Island of Mann\\". The short form often used in English, Mann, is derived from the Manx Mannin,[12] though sometimes the name is written as Man. The earliest recorded Manx form of the name is Manu or Mana.[13]\\r\\nThe Old Irish form of the name is Manau or Mano. Old Welsh records named it as Manaw, also reflected in Manaw Gododdin, the name for an ancient district in north Britain along the lower Firth of Forth.[14] The oldest known reference to the island calls it Mona, in Latin (Julius Caesar, 54?BC); in the 1st century, Pliny the Elder records it as Monapia or Monabia, and Ptolemy (2nd century) as Mon?da (MϫѴϫ, Monaoida) or Mϫϫ (Monarina), in Koine Greek. Later Latin references have Mevania or M?navia (Orosius, 416),[15] and Eubonia or Eumonia by Irish writers. It is found in the Sagas of Icelanders as M?n.[16]\\r\\nThe name is probably cognate with the Welsh name of the island of Anglesey, Ynys M?n,[17] usually derived from a Celtic word for 'mountain' (reflected in Welsh mynydd, Breton menez, and Scottish Gaelic monadh),[18][19] from a Proto-Celtic *moniyos.\\r\\nThe name was at least secondarily associated with that of Manannn mac Lir in Irish mythology (corresponding to Welsh Manawydan fab Ll?r).[20] In the earliest Irish mythological texts, Manannn is a king of the otherworld, but the 9th-century Sanas Cormaic identifies a euhemerised Manannn as \\"a famous merchant who resided in, and gave name to, the Isle of Man\\".[21] Later, a Manannn is recorded as the first king of Mann in a Manx poem (dated 1504).[22]\\r\\nThe island was cut off from the surrounding islands around 8000?BC, and was colonised by sea some time before 6500?BC.[23] The first residents were Hunter-gatherers and fishermen. Examples of their tools are kept at the Manx Museum.[24]\\r\\nThe Neolithic Period marked the beginning of farming, and megalithic monuments began to appear, such as Cashtal yn Ard near Maughold, King Orry's Grave at Laxey, Meayll Circle near Cregneash, and Ballaharra Stones at St John's. There were also the local Ronaldsway and Bann cultures.[25]\\r\\nDuring the Bronze Age, burial mounds became smaller. Bodies were put in stone-lined graves with ornamental containers. The Bronze Age burial mounds created long-lasting markers around the countryside.[26]\\r\\nThe ancient Romans knew of the island and called it Insula Manavia[27] although it is uncertain whether they conquered the island. Around the 5th century AD, large-scale migration from Ireland precipitated a process of Gaelicisation evidenced by Ogham inscriptions, giving rise to the Manx language, which is a Goidelic language closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic.[28]\\r\\nVikings arrived at the end of the 8th century. They established Tynwald and introduced many land divisions that still exist. In 1266 King Magnus VI of Norway ceded the islands to Scotland in the Treaty of Perth; but Scotland's rule over Mann did not become firmly established until 1275, when the Manx were defeated in the Battle of Ronaldsway, near Castletown.\\r\\nIn 1290 King Edward I of England sent Walter de Huntercombe to take possession of Mann. It remained in English hands until 1313, when Robert Bruce took it after besieging Castle Rushen for five weeks. A confused period followed when Mann was sometimes under English rule and sometimes Scottish, until 1346, when the Battle of Neville's Cross decided the long struggle between England and Scotland in England's favour.\\r\\nEnglish rule was delegated to a series of lords and magnates. The Tynwald passed laws concerning the government of the island in all respects and had control over its finances, but was subject to the approval of the Lord of Mann.\\r\\nIn 1866, the Isle of Man obtained limited Home Rule, with partly democratic elections to the House of Keys, but an appointed Legislative Council. Since then, democratic government has been gradually extended.\\r\\nThe Isle of Man is located in the middle of the northern Irish Sea, almost equidistant from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland (closest), and Wales (farthest). It is 52 kilometres (32?mi) long and, at its widest point, 22 kilometres (14?mi) wide. It has an area of around 572 square kilometres (221?sq?mi).[29] Besides the island of Mann itself, the political unit of the Isle of Man includes some nearby small islands: the seasonally inhabited Calf of Man,[30] Chicken Rock on which stands an unmanned lighthouse, St Patrick's Isle and St Michael's Isle. The last two of these are connected to the main island by permanent roads/causeways.\\r\\nRanges of hills in the north and south are separated by a central valley. The northern plain, by contrast, is relatively flat, consisting mainly of deposits from glacial advances from western Scotland during colder times. There are more recently deposited shingle beaches at the northernmost point, the Point of Ayre. The island has one mountain higher than 600 metres (2,000?ft), Snaefell, with a height of 620 metres (2,034?ft).[29] According to an old saying, from the summit one can see six kingdoms: those of Mann, Scotland, England, Ireland, Wales, and Heaven.[31][32][33] Some versions add a seventh kingdom, that of the sea, or Neptune.[34][35][excessive citations]\\r\\nAt the 2016 census,[36] the Isle of Man was home to 83,314 people, of whom 26,997 resided in the island's capital, Douglas and 9,128 in the adjoining village of Onchan. The population decreased by 1.4% between the 2011 and 2016 censuses. By country of birth, those born in the Isle of Man were the largest group (49.8%), while those born in the United Kingdom were the next largest group at 40% (33.9% in England, 3% in Scotland, 2% in Northern Ireland and 1.1% in Wales), 1.8% in the Republic of Ireland and 0.75% in the Channel Islands. The remaining 8.5% were born elsewhere in the world, with 5% coming from EU countries (other than the UK and Ireland).\\r\\nThe Isle of Man Full Census, last held in 2016,[37] has been a decennial occurrence since 1821, with interim censuses being introduced from 1966. It is separate from, but similar to, the Census in the United Kingdom.\\r\\nThe 2001 census was conducted by the Economic Affairs Division of the Isle of Man Treasury, under the authority of the Census Act 1929.\\r\\nThe Isle of Man has a temperate oceanic climate (K?ppen Cfb). Average rainfall is higher than averaged over the territory of the British Isles, because the Isle of Man is far enough from Ireland for the prevailing south-westerly winds to accumulate moisture. Average rainfall is highest at Snaefell, where it is around 1,900 millimetres (75?in) a year. At lower levels it can be around 800 millimetres (31?in) a year. The highest recorded temperature was 28.9?C (84.0?F) at Ronaldsway on 12 July 1983.\\r\\nThe Lord of Mann is responsible for the Island's defence and ultimately for good governance, and for representing the island in international forums, while the island's own parliament and government have competence over all domestic matters.[40]\\r\\nThe island's parliament, Tynwald, is claimed to have been in continuous existence since 979 or earlier, purportedly making it the oldest continuously governing body in the world, though evidence supports a much later date.[41] Tynwald is a bicameral or tricameral legislature, comprising the House of Keys (directly elected by universal suffrage with a voting age of 16 years) and the Legislative Council (consisting of indirectly elected and ex-officio members). These two bodies also meet together in joint session as Tynwald Court.\\r\\nThe executive branch of government is the Council of Ministers, which is composed of members of the House of Keys. It is headed by the Chief Minister, currently (2017) Howard Quayle MHK.\\r\\nVice-regal functions of the Head of State are performed by a Lieutenant Governor.\\r\\nUnder British law, the Isle of Man is not part of the United Kingdom. However, the UK takes care of its external and defence affairs.[42] There are no independent military forces on the Isle of Man, although HMS Ramsey is affiliated with the town of the same name.[43] From 1938 to 1955 there was the Manx Regiment of the British Territorial Army, which saw extensive action during the Second World War.[44] In 1779, the Manx Fencible Corps, a fencible regiment of three companies, was raised; it was disbanded in 1783 at the end of the American War of Independence. Later, the Royal Manx Fencibles was raised at the time of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. The 1st Battalion (of 3 companies) was raised in 1793. A 2nd Battalion (of 10 companies) was raised in 1795,[45] and it saw action during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The regiment was disbanded in 1802.[46] A third body of Manx Fencibles was raised in 1803 to defend the Island during the Napoleonic Wars and to assist the Revenue. It was disbanded in 1811.[47] In 2015 a multi-capability recruiting and training unit of the British Army Reserve was established in Douglas.[48]\\r\\nThe Isle of Man Government maintains five emergency services.[49] These are:\\r\\nAll of these services are controlled directly by the Isle of Man Government, and are independent of the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, the Isle of Man Constabulary voluntarily submits to inspection by the British inspectorate of police,[50] and the Isle of Man Coastguard contracts Her Majesty's Coastguard (UK) for air-sea rescue operations.\\r\\nCitizenship in the Isle of Man is governed by British law. Passports issued by the Isle of Man Passport Office say \\"British Islands ÿ Isle of Man\\" on the cover but the nationality status stated on the passport is simply \\"British Citizen\\". Although Manx passport holders are British citizens, because the Isle of Man is not part of the European Union, people born on the Island without a parent or grandparent either born, naturalised, registered or resident for more than five consecutive years in the United Kingdom do not have the same rights as other British citizens with regard to employment and establishment in the EU. Isle of Man passports can be issued to any British citizen in the Isle of Man (whether or not that person has \\"Manx status\\" as an Isle of Man worker under the local Isle of Man employment laws). They can also be issued to Manx-connected British citizens residing in Britain or either of the other Crown Dependencies.\\r\\nThe Isle of Man holds neither membership nor associate membership of the European Union, and thus did not take part in the 2016 referendum on the UK's EU membership. Protocol 3 of the UK's Act of Accession to the Treaty of Rome included the Isle of Man within the EU's customs area, allowing for trade in Manx goods without tariffs throughout the EU.[51] However, there are still limitations on the movement of capital and services.\\r\\nEU citizens are entitled to travel and reside, but not work, in the island without restriction. And Manx citizenswithout the hereditary qualification outlined aboveare similarly restricted from working in the EU.[52][53]\\r\\nThe effect of the UK leaving the European Union is uncertain. The UK has confirmed that the Crown Dependencies' position will be included in the Brexit negotiations.[54]:ch.5\\r\\nThe Isle of Man is not itself a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. By virtue of its relationship with the United Kingdom, it takes part in several Commonwealth institutions, including the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Commonwealth Games. The Government of the Isle of Man has made calls for a more integrated relationship with the Commonwealth,[55] including more direct representation and enhanced participation in Commonwealth organisations and meetings, including Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings.[56] The Chief Minister of the Isle of Man has said: \\"A closer connection with the Commonwealth itself would be a welcome further development of the Island's international relationships.\\"[57]\\r\\nMost Manx politicians stand for election as independents rather than as representatives of political parties. Though political parties do exist, their influence is not nearly as strong as in the United Kingdom.\\r\\nThere are two political parties in the Isle of Man. The Liberal Vannin Party (established 2006) has two seats in the House of Keys; they promote greater Manx independence and more accountability in Government. The Manx Labour Party is the other: until 28 February 2018 they held two seats in the Legislative Council.\\r\\nA number of pressure groups also exist on the island. Mec Vannin advocate the establishment of a sovereign republic.[58] The Positive Action Group[out of date?] campaign for three key elements to be introduced into the governance of the island: open accountable government, rigorous control of public finances, and a fairer society.[59]\\r\\nLocal government on the Isle of Man is based partly on the island's 17 ancient parishes. There are two types of local authorities:\\r\\nLocal authorities are under the supervision of the Isle of Man Government's Department of Local Government and the Environment (DOLGE).\\r\\nPublic education is under the Department of Education and Children. Thirty-two primary schools, five secondary schools, and the University College Isle of Man function under the department.[60]\\r\\nHealth and social care on the Isle of Man is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Social Care (Isle of Man). Healthcare is free for residents and visitors from the UK.[61]\\r\\nThe Isle of Man Department for Enterprise manages the diversified economy in twelve key sectors.[62] The largest sectors by GNP are insurance and eGaming with 17% of GNP each, followed by ICT and banking with 9% each. The 2016 census lists 41,636 total employed. [63] The largest sectors by employment are \\"medical and health\\", \\"financial and business services\\", construction, retail and public administration.[64] Manufacturing, focused on aerospace and the food and drink industry,[65] employs almost 2000 workers and contributes with about 5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The sector provides laser optics, industrial diamonds, electronics, plastics and aerospace precision engineering. Tourism, agriculture, fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, now make very little contributions to the island's GDP.\\r\\nAfter thirty years of continued GDP growth, the unemployment rate is just around 1%.\\r\\nThe Isle of Man is a low-tax economy with no capital gains tax, wealth tax, stamp duty, or inheritance tax[66] and a top rate of income tax of 20%.[67] A tax cap is in force: the maximum amount of tax payable by an individual is S125,000 or S250,000 for couples if they choose to have their incomes jointly assessed. Personal income is assessed and taxed on a total worldwide income basis rather than a remittance basis. This means that all income earned throughout the world is assessable for Manx tax rather than only income earned in or brought into the island.\\r\\nThe standard rate of corporation tax for residents and non-residents is 0%. Retail business profits above S500,000 and banking business income are taxed at 10%, and rental (or other) income from land and buildings situated on the Isle of Man is taxed at 20%.[68]\\r\\nTrade takes place mostly with the United Kingdom. The island is in customs union with the UK, and related revenues are pooled and shared under the Common Purse Agreement. This means that the Isle of Man cannot have the lower excise revenues on alcohol and other goods that are enjoyed in the Channel Islands.\\r\\nThe Manx government promotes island locations for making films by offering financial support. Since 1995, over 100 films have been made on the island.[69] Most recently the Island takes a much wider strategy to attract the general digital media industry in film, television, video and eSports.[70]\\r\\nThe Isle of Man Government Lottery operated from 1986 to 1997. Since 2 December 1999 the island has participated in the United Kingdom National Lottery.[71][72] The island is the only jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom where it is possible to play the UK National Lottery.[73] Since 2010 it has also been possible for projects in the Isle of Man to receive national lottery Good Causes Funding.[74][75] The good causes funding is distributed by the Manx Lottery Trust.[76] Tynwald receives the 12p lottery duty for tickets sold in the Island.\\r\\nTourist numbers peaked in the first half of the 20th century, prior to the boom in cheap travel to Southern Europe that also saw the decline of tourism in many similar English seaside resorts. The Isle of Man tourism board has recently invested in \\"Dark Sky Discovery\\" sites to diversify its tourism industry. It is expected that dark skies will generally be nominated by the public across the UK. However, the Isle of Man tourism board tasked someone from their team to nominate 27 places on the island as a civil task. This cluster of the highest quality \\"Milky Way\\" sites [77] is now well promoted within the island. This government push has effectively given the island a headstart in the number of recognised Dark Sky sites. However, this has created a distorted view when compared to the UK where this isn't promoted on a national scale. There, Dark Sky sites are expected to be nominated over time by the public across a full cross section of national town, city and countryside locations rather than en masse by government departments.[78]\\r\\nIn 2017 an office of The International Stock Exchange was opened to provide a boost for the island's finance industry.[79]\\r\\nThe main telephone provider on the Isle of Man is Manx Telecom. The island has two mobile operators: Manx Telecom, previously known as Manx Pronto, and Sure. Cloud9 operated as a third mobile operator on the island for a short time, but has since withdrawn.[citation needed] Broadband internet services are available through four local providers: Wi-Manx, Domicilium, Manx Computer Bureau and Manx Telecom. The island does not have its own ITU country code, but is accessed via the British country code (+44), and the island's telephone numbers are part of the British telephone numbering plan, with local dialling codes 01624 for landlines and 07524, 07624 and 07924 for mobiles. Calls to the island from the UK however, are generally charged differently from those within the UK, and may or may not be included in any \\"inclusive minutes\\" packages.[80][81]\\r\\nIn 1996, the Isle of Man Government obtained permission to use the .im national top-level domain (TLD), and has ultimate responsibility for its use. The domain is managed from day to day by Domicilium, an island-based internet service provider.\\r\\nIn December 2007, the Manx Electricity Authority and its telecommunications subsidiary, e-llan Communications, commissioned the laying of a new fibre-optic link that connects the island to a worldwide fibre-optic network.\\r\\nThe Isle of Man has three radio stations: Manx Radio, Energy FM and 3 FM.\\r\\nThere is no insular television service, but local transmitters retransmit British mainland digital broadcasts via the free-to-air digital terrestrial service Freeview. The Isle of Man is served by BBC North West for BBC One and BBC Two television services, and Granada Television for ITV.\\r\\nMany television services are available by satellite, such as Sky, and Freesat from the group of satellites at 28.2 East, as well as services from a range of other satellites around Europe such as the Astra satellites at 19.2 east and Hotbird.\\r\\nThe Isle of Man has three newspapers, all weeklies, and all owned by Isle of Man Newspapers, a division of the Edinburgh media company Johnston Press.[82] The Isle of Man Courier (distribution 36,318) is free and distributed to homes on the island. The other two newspapers are Isle of Man Examiner (circulation 13,276) and the Manx Independent (circulation 12,255).[83]\\r\\nPostal services are the responsibility of Isle of Man Post, which took over from the British General Post Office in 1973.\\r\\nThere is a comprehensive bus network, operated by the government-owned bus operator Bus Vannin.[84]\\r\\nThe Isle of Man Sea Terminal in Douglas has regular ferries to and from Heysham and to and from Liverpool, with a more restricted timetable operating in winter. There are also limited summer-only services to and from Belfast and Dublin. The Dublin route also operates at Christmas. At the time of the Isle of Man TT a limited number of sailings operate to and from Larne in Northern Ireland. All ferries are operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company.[85]\\r\\nThe only commercial airport on the island is the Isle of Man Airport at Ronaldsway. There are direct scheduled and chartered flights to numerous airports in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[86]\\r\\nOne of the oldest operating horse tram services is located on the sea front in the capital, Douglas. It was founded in 1876.[87]\\r\\nThe island used to have an extensive narrow-gauge railway system, both steam-operated and electric, but the majority of the steam railway tracks were taken out of service many years ago, and the track removed. As of 2017, there is a steam railway between Douglas and Port Erin, an electric railway between Douglas and Ramsey and an electric mountain railway which climbs Snaefell.[87]\\r\\nThe island has a total of 688 miles (1,107?km)[88] of public roads, all of which are paved. There is no overriding national speed restriction; only local speed limits are set and some roads have no speed limit. Rules for reckless driving and most other driving regulations are enforced in a similar way to the UK.[89] One proposal currently[out of date?] under consideration by the Isle of Man Government to improve road safety is the introduction of compulsory vehicle tests (similar to MOT tests in the UK).[90]\\r\\nThe Isle of Man has become a centre for emerging private space travel companies.[91] A number of the competitors in the Google Lunar X Prize, a $30 million competition for the first privately funded team to send a robot to the Moon, are based on the Island. The team summit for the X Prize was held on the Island in October 2010.[92] In January 2011 two research space stations owned by Excalibur Almaz arrived on the Island and were kept in an aircraft hangar at the airfield at the former RAF Jurby near Jurby.[93]\\r\\nThe culture of the Isle of Man is often promoted as being influenced by its Celtic and, to a lesser extent, its Norse origins. Proximity to the UK, popularity as a UK tourist destination in Victorian times, and immigration from Britain has meant that the cultures of Great Britain have been influential at least since Revestment. Revival campaigns have attempted to preserve the surviving vestiges of Manx culture after a long period of Anglicisation, and there has been significantly increased interest in the Manx language, history and musical tradition.\\r\\nThe official languages of the Isle of Man are, since 1985, Manx and English.[94] Manx has traditionally been spoken but is now considered \\"critically endangered\\".[95]\\r\\nManx is a Goidelic Celtic language and is one of a number of insular Celtic languages spoken in the British Isles.[96] Manx has been officially recognised as a legitimate autochthonous regional language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, ratified by the United Kingdom on 27 March 2001 on behalf of the Isle of Man government.[97]\\r\\nManx is closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic, but is orthographically sui generis.\\r\\nOn the island, the Manx greetings moghrey mie (good morning) and fastyr mie (good afternoon) can often be heard.[98] As in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the concepts of \\"evening\\" and \\"afternoon\\" are referred to with one word.[99] Two other Manx expressions often heard are Gura mie eu (\\"Thank you\\"; familiar 2nd person singular form Gura mie ayd) and traa dy liooar, meaning \\"time enough\\", this represents a stereotypical view of the Manx attitude to life.[100][101]\\r\\nFor centuries, the island's symbol has been the so-called \\"three legs of Mann\\" (Manx: Tree Cassyn Vannin), a triskelion of three legs conjoined at the thigh. The Manx triskelion, which dates with certainty to the late 13th century, is of uncertain origin. It has been suggested that its origin lies in Sicily, an island which has been associated with the triskelion since ancient times.[102][103]\\r\\nThe symbol appears in the island's official flag and official coat of arms, as well as its currency. The Manx triskelion may be reflected in the island's motto, Latin: Quocunque jeceris stabit, which appears as part of the island's coat of arms. The Latin motto translates into English as \\"whichever way you throw, it will stand\\"[104] or \\"whithersoever you throw it, it will stand\\".[1] It dates to the late 17th century when it is known to have appeared on the island's coinage.[104] It has also been suggested that the motto originally referred to the poor quality of coinage which was common at the timeas in \\"however it is tested it will pass\\".[105]\\r\\nThe ragwort or cushag is the Manx national flower.[106]\\r\\nThe predominant religious tradition of the island is Christianity. Before the Protestant Reformation, the island had a long history as part of the Catholic Church, and in the years following the Reformation, the religious authorities on the island, and later the population of the island, accepted the religious authority of the British monarchy and the Church of England.[107] It has also come under the influence of Irish religious tradition. The island forms a separate diocese called Sodor and Man, which in the distant past comprised the medieval kingdom of Man and the Scottish isles (\\"Suereyjar\\" in Old Norse). It now consists of 16 parishes,[108] and since 1541[109] has formed part of the Province of York.[110] (These modern ecclesiastical parishes do not correspond to the island's ancient parishes mentioned in this article under \\"Local Government\\", but more closely reflect the current geographical distribution of population.)\\r\\nOther Christian churches also operate on the Isle of Man. The second largest denomination is the Methodist Church, whose Isle of Man District is close in numbers to the Anglican diocese. There are eight Catholic parish churches, included in the Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool, as well as a presence of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Additionally there are five Baptist churches, four Pentecostal churches, the Salvation Army, a ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, two congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses, two United Reformed churches, as well as other Christian churches. There is a small Muslim community, with its own mosque in Douglas, and there is also a small Jewish community.[111]\\r\\nIn Manx mythology, the island was ruled by the sea god Manannn, who would draw his misty cloak around the island to protect it from invaders. One of the principal folk theories about the origin of the name Mann is that it is named after Manannn.\\r\\nIn the Manx tradition of folklore, there are many stories of mythical creatures and characters. These include the Buggane, a malevolent spirit which, according to legend, blew the roof off St Trinian's Church in a fit of rage; the Fenodyree; the Glashtyn; and the Moddey Dhoo, a ghostly black dog which wandered the walls and corridors of Peel Castle.\\r\\nThe Isle of Man is also said to be home to fairies, known locally as \\"the little folk\\" or \\"themselves\\". There is a famous Fairy Bridge, and it is said to be bad luck if one fails to wish the fairies good morning or afternoon when passing over it. It used to be a tradition to leave a coin on the bridge to ensure good luck. Other types of fairies are the Mi'raj and the Arkan Sonney.\\r\\nAn old Irish story tells how Lough Neagh was formed when Ireland's legendary giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (commonly anglicised to Finn McCool) ripped up a portion of the land and tossed it at a Scottish rival. He missed, and the chunk of earth landed in the Irish Sea, thus creating the island.\\r\\nPeel Castle has been proposed as a possible location of the Arthurian Avalon[112] or as the location of the Grail Castle, site of Lancelot's encounter with the sword bridge of King Melegaunt.[113]\\r\\nOne of the most often-repeated myths is that people found guilty of witchcraft were rolled down Slieau Whallian, a hill near St John's, in a barrel. However this is a 19th-century legend which comes from a Scottish legend, which in turn comes from a German legend. It never happened. Separately, a witchcraft museum was opened at the Witches Mill, Castletown in 1951. There has never actually been a witches' coven on that site; the myth was only created with the opening of the museum.[114]\\r\\nThe music of the Isle of Man reflects Celtic, Norse and other influences, including from its neighbours, Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales. A wide range of music is performed on the island, such as rock, blues, jazz and pop. However, its traditional folk music has undergone a revival since the 1970s, starting with a music festival called Yn ?hruinnaght in Ramsey.[115] This was part of a general revival of the Manx language and culture after the death of the last native speaker of Manx in 1974. The Isle of Man was mentioned in the Who song \\"Happy Jack\\" as the homeland of the song's titular character, who is always in a state of ecstasy, no matter what happens to him. It is also the birthplace of Maurice, Robin and Barry Gibb, of the Bee Gees.\\r\\nIn the past the basic national dish of the island was spuds and herrin, boiled potatoes and herring. This plain dish was supported by the subsistence farmers of the island, who crofted the land and fished the sea for centuries. A more recent claim for the title of national dish could be the ubiquitous chips, cheese and gravy. This dish, which is similar to poutine, is found in most of the island's fast-food outlets, and consists of thick cut chips, covered in shredded Cheddar cheese and topped with a thick gravy.[116]\\r\\nSeafood has traditionally accounted for a large proportion of the local diet. Although commercial fishing has declined in recent years, local delicacies include Manx kippers (smoked herring) which are produced by the smokeries in Peel on the west coast of the island, albeit mainly from North Sea herring these days.[117] The smokeries also produce other specialities including smoked salmon and bacon.\\r\\nCrab, lobster and scallops are commercially fished, and the Queen Scallop (Queenies) is regarded as a particular delicacy, with a light, sweet flavour.[118] Cod, ling and mackerel are often angled for the table, and freshwater trout and salmon can be taken from the local rivers and lakes, supported by the government fish hatchery at Cornaa on the east coast.\\r\\nCattle, sheep, pigs and poultry are all commercially farmed; Manx lamb from the hill farms is a popular dish. The Loaghtan, the indigenous breed of Manx sheep, has a rich, dark meat that has found favour with chefs,[119][120] featuring in dishes on the BBC's MasterChef series.\\r\\nManx cheese has also found some success, featuring smoked and herb-flavoured varieties, and is stocked by many of the UK's supermarket chains.[121][122][123] Manx cheese took bronze medals in the 2005 British Cheese Awards, and sold 578 tonnes over the year. Manx cheddar has been exported to Canada where it is available in some supermarkets.[124]\\r\\nBeer is brewed on a commercial scale by Okells Brewery, which was established in 1850 and is the island's largest brewer; and also by Bushy's Brewery and the Hooded Ram Brewery. The Isle of Man's Pure Beer Act of 1874, which resembles the German Reinheitsgebot is still in effect: under this Act, brewers may only use water, malt, sugar and hops in their brews.[125]\\r\\nThe Isle of Man is represented as a nation in the Commonwealth Games and the Island Games and hosted the IV Commonwealth Youth Games in 2011. Manx athletes have won three gold medals at the Commonwealth Games, including the one by cyclist Mark Cavendish in 2006 in the Scratch race. The Island Games were first held on the island in 1985, and again in 2001.\\r\\nIsle of Man teams and individuals participate in many sports both on and off the island including rugby union, football, gymnastics, field hockey, netball, Taekwondo, bowling, Obstacle Course Racing and cricket. It being an island, many types of watersports are also popular with residents.\\r\\nThe main international event associated with the island is the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy race, colloquially known as \\"The TT\\",[126] which began in 1907. It takes place in late May and early June. The TT is now an international road racing event for motorcycles, which used to be part of the World Championship, and is long considered to be one of the \\"greatest motorcycle sporting events of the world\\".[127] Taking place over a two-week period, it has become a festival for motorcycling culture, makes a huge contribution to the island's economy and has become part of Manx identity.[128] For many, the Isle carries the title \\"road racing capital of the world\\".[129]\\r\\nThe Manx Grand Prix is a separate motorcycle event for amateurs and private entrants that uses the same 60.70?km (37.72?mi)[130] Snaefell Mountain Course in late August and early September.\\r\\nPrior to the introduction of football at the beginning of the 20th century, Cammag was the island's national sport.[131] It is similar to the Irish hurling and the Scottish game of shinty. Nowadays there is an annual match at St John's.\\r\\nThe Isle of Man has two cinemas, both in Douglas. The Broadway Cinema is located in the Government-owned and -run Villa Marina and Gaiety Theatre complex. It has a capacity of 154 and also doubles as a conference venue.[132]\\r\\nThe Palace Cinema is located next to the derelict Castle Mona hotel and is operated by the Sefton Group. It has two screens: Screen One holds 293 customers, while Screen Two is smaller with a capacity of just 95. It was extensively refurbished in August 2011.[133]\\r\\nThere are two domestic animals specifically connected to the Isle of Man, though they are also found elsewhere.\\r\\nThe Manx cat is a breed of cat noted for its genetic mutation that causes it to have a shortened tail. The length of this tail can range from a few inches, known as a \\"stumpy\\", to being completely nonexistent, or \\"rumpy\\". Manx cats display a range of colours and usually have somewhat longer hind legs compared to most cats. The cats have been used as a symbol of the Isle of Man on coins and stamps and at one time the Manx government operated a breeding centre to ensure the continuation of the breed.[134]\\r\\nThe Manx Loaghtan sheep is a breed native to the island. It has dark brown wool and four, or sometimes six, horns. The meat is considered to be a delicacy.[135] There are several flocks on the island and others have been started in England and Jersey.\\r\\nA more recent arrival on the island is the red-necked wallaby, which is now established on the island following an escape from the Wildlife Park.[136]\\r\\nThere are also many feral goats in Garff: a matter which was raised in Tynwald Court in January 2018.[137]\\r\\nIn March 2016 the Isle of Man became the first entire country to be adopted into UNESCO's Network of Biosphere Reserves.[138]\\r\\nClick on a coloured area to see an article about English in that country or region\\r\\nCoordinates: 5415N 0430W? / ?54.250N 4.500W? / 54.250; -4.500","input":"What is the capital of isle of man?"},{"output":"three","context":"Naturally occurring lithium (3Li) is composed of two stable isotopes, lithium-6 and lithium-7, with the latter being far more abundant: about 92.5 percent of the atoms. Both of the natural isotopes have an unexpectedly low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (~5.3 MeV) when compared with the adjacent lighter and heavier elements, helium (~7.1?MeV) and beryllium (~6.5?MeV). The longest-lived radioisotope of lithium is lithium-8, which has a half-life of just 838 milliseconds. Lithium-9 has a half-life of 178 milliseconds, and lithium-11 has a half-life of about 8.6 milliseconds. All of the remaining isotopes of lithium have half-lives that are shorter than 10 nanoseconds. The shortest-lived known isotope of lithium is lithium-4, which decays by proton emission with a half-life of about 6977909999999999999?9.1G10?23 seconds, although the half-life of lithium-3 is yet to be determined, and is likely to be much shorter, like helium-2 (diproton) which undergoes proton decay within 6991100000000000000?10?9 s.\\r\\nLithium-7 and lithium-6 are two of the primordial nuclides that were produced in the Big Bang, with lithium-7 to be 10?9 of all primordial nuclides and amount of lithium-6 around 10?13.[2] A small percentage of lithium-6 is also known to be produced by nuclear reactions in certain stars. The isotopes of lithium separate somewhat during a variety of geological processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation and ion exchange). Lithium ions replace magnesium or iron in certain octahedral locations in clays, and lithium-6 is sometimes preferred over lithium-7. This results in some enrichment of lithium-7 in geological processes.\\r\\nLithium-6 is an important isotope in nuclear physics because when it is bombarded with neutrons, tritium is produced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLithium-6 has a greater affinity than lithium-7 for the element mercury. When an amalgam of lithium and mercury is added to solutions containing lithium hydroxide, the lithium-6 becomes more concentrated in the amalgam and the lithium-7 more in the hydroxide solution.\\r\\nThe colex (column exchange) separation method makes use of this by passing a counter-flow of amalgam and hydroxide through a cascade of stages. The fraction of lithium-6 is preferentially drained by the mercury, but the lithium-7 flows mostly with the hydroxide. At the bottom of the column, the lithium (enriched with lithium-6) is separated from the amalgam, and the mercury is recovered to be reused with fresh raw material. At the top, the lithium hydroxide solution is electrolyzed to liberate the lithium-7 fraction. The enrichment obtained with this method varies with the column length and the flow speed.\\r\\nLithium is heated to a temperature of about 550?C in a vacuum. Lithium atoms evaporate from the liquid surface and are collected on a cold surface positioned a few centimetres above the liquid surface. Since lithium-6 atoms have a greater mean free path, they are collected preferentially.\\r\\nThe theoretical separation efficiency is about 8.0 percent. A multistage process may be used to obtain higher degrees of separation.\\r\\nLithium-4 contains three protons and one neutron. It is the shortest-lived known isotope of lithium, with a half-life of about 91 yoctoseconds, 6977909999999999999?9.1G10?23 seconds and decays by proton emission to helium-3.[3] Lithium-4 can be formed as an intermediate in some nuclear fusion reactions.\\r\\nLithium-6 is valuable as the source material for the production of tritium (hydrogen-3) and as an absorber of neutrons in nuclear fusion reactions. Natural lithium contains about 7.5 percent lithium-6, with the rest being lithium-7. Large amounts of lithium-6 have been separated out for placing into hydrogen bombs. The separation of lithium-6 has by now ceased in the large thermonuclear powers, but stockpiles of it remain in these countries. Lithium-6 is one of only three stable isotopes with a spin of 1[n 1][4] and has the smallest nonzero nuclear electric quadrupole moment of any stable nucleus.\\r\\nLithium-7 is by far the most-common isotope, making up about 92.5?percent of all natural lithium. A lithium-7 atom contains three protons, four neutrons, and three electrons. Because of its nuclear properties lithium-7 is less common than helium, beryllium, carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen in the Universe, even though the latter four all have heavier nuclei.\\r\\nThe industrial production of lithium-6 results in a waste product which is enriched in lithium-7 and depleted in lithium-6. This material has been sold commercially, and some of it has been released into the environment. A relative abundance of lithium-7, as high as 35 percent greater than the natural value, has been measured in the ground water in a carbonate aquifer underneath the West Valley Creek in Pennsylvania, which is downstream from a lithium processing plant. In the depleted lithium, the relative abundance of lithium-6 can be reduced to as little as 20 percent of its nominal value, giving an atomic mass for the discharged[clarification needed] lithium that can range from about 6.94 Da to about 7.00 Da. Hence the isotopic composition of lithium can vary somewhat depending on its source. An accurate atomic mass for samples of lithium cannot be measured for all sources of lithium.[5]\\r\\nLithium-7 is used as a part of the molten lithium fluoride in molten salt reactors: liquid-fluoride nuclear reactors. The large neutron-absorption cross-section of lithium-6 (about 940 barns[6]) as compared with the very small neutron cross-section of lithium-7 (about 45 millibarns) makes high separation of lithium-7 from natural lithium a strong requirement for the possible use in lithium fluoride reactors.\\r\\nLithium-7 hydroxide is used for alkalizing of the coolant in pressurized water reactors.[7]\\r\\nSome lithium-7 has been produced, for a few picoseconds, which contains a lambda particle in its nucleus, whereas an atomic nucleus is generally thought to contain only neutrons, protons, and pions.[8][9]\\r\\nLithium-11 is thought to possess a halo nucleus consisting of a core of three protons and eight neutrons, two of which are in a nuclear halo. It has an exceptionally large cross-section of 3.16 fm2, comparable to that of 208Pb. It decays by beta emission to 11Be, which then decays in several ways (see table below).\\r\\nLithium-12 has a considerably shorter half-life of around 10 nanoseconds. It decays by neutron emission into 11Li, which decays as mentioned above.\\r\\nWhile ? decay into isotopes of beryllium (often combined with single- or multiple-neutron emission) is predominant over heavier isotopes of lithium, 10Li and 12Li decay via neutron emission into 9Li and 11Li respectively due to their positions above the neutron drip line. Lithium-11 has also been observed to decay via multiple forms of fission. Lighter isotopes of lithium (<6Li) are only known to decay by proton emission. The decay modes of the two isomers of 10Li are unknown.\\r\\nLewis, G. N.; MacDonald, R. T. (1936). \\"The Separation of Lithium Isotopes\\".

He completed his Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy degree at the Lyceum of the Philippines University before entering the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) in 1967.[2] Now-senator Gregorio Honasan was his classmate.[3][4]\\r\\nAfter his graduation in 1971, Lacson was commissioned in the Philippine Constabulary (PC), then a major service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) responsible for maintaining peace and order and enforcement of laws in the country.[2]\\r\\nIn 1996 he earned a postgraduate degree of Master in Government Management from the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila.[2]\\r\\nIn March 2016, Lacson disclosed his late mother Maxima instilled discipline in him and his siblings, along with a sense of right and wrong. This would become part of his personal motto, \\"What is right must be kept right; what is wrong must be set right.\\" [5]\\r\\nLacson worked at the PC Metropolitan Command (Metrocom), Intelligence and Security Group (MISG), from 1971 to 1986. The MISG was commanded by the late Colonel Rolando Abadilla. Lacson rose through the ranks, becoming lieutenant colonel in the mid-1980s. After the 1986 People Power Revolution, he served at the PC-INP Anti-Carnapping Task Force as its commander from 1986ÿ1988, as Provincial Commander of the Province of Isabela from 1988ÿ1989, and as Commander of the Cebu Metropolitan District Command (Metrodiscom) from 1989ÿ1992. In 1991, he joined the then-newly created civilian Philippine National Police, or PNP, formed as a result of the merger of the military Philippine Constabulary and the civilian Integrated National Police or INP. (The INP was formed in 1975 as an integration of all local police forces in the country then under operational control of the PC.) Soon Lacson became Provincial Director of the Province of Laguna from February to July 1992. Afterwards, he was appointed Chief of Task Force Habagat at the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission from 1992 to 1995. From 1996 to April 1997, he was given the task of project officer of \\"Special Project Alpha.\\"\\r\\nAs Chief PNP, Lacson eliminated the Kotong culture among the police officers. He rationalized the distribution of financial and logistical resources by downloading 85 percent to the police frontline units, retaining only 15 percent in the police headquarters. He imposed a no-nonsense and strict physical fitness test on all PNP members, invoking the now-famous 34-inch maximum waistline for all the police officers.\\r\\nLacson also demonstrated a high sense of integrity, and led by example. He consistently refused to accept bribe money from illegal gambling operators and contractors and suppliers transacting business with the PNP, even declining offers of monetary rewards from grateful kidnap-for-ransom victims after rescuing them from their captors. [6]\\r\\nUnder Lacson's leadership, the PNP achieved a high 58% public approval rating, while Lacson got a 78% approval rating for himself. [7]\\r\\nIn 1995, the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission (PACC) was linked to the killing of 11 members of Kuratong Baleleng in Quezon City. In 2003, the High Tribunal ordered the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to try the case against Lacson and 33 other police officials. The trial court however dismissed the criminal case, finding absence of probable cause. The special prosecuting team later moved for new trial before the High Tribunal to remand case to the trial court to present new evidence against Senator Lacson, inter alia. On May 2, 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines resolved to take cognizance of the motion of the families of the slain Kuratong Baleleng members for revival of the murder case against police officials and Senator Panfilo Lacson.[8]\\r\\nOn November 13, 2012, the Supreme Court in an en banc decision denied the government's motion to revive the case and affirmed the lower court\\"s decision dismissing it.[9]\\r\\nOn November 24, 2000, publicist Salvador Bubby Dacer and his driver, Emmanuel Corbito were abducted in Makati City. In April 2001, their burnt corpses were found by a creek in Indang, Cavite. The Department of Justice filed double murder charges against Police Senior Superintendent Michael Ray Aquino and other police officers, including Senior Superintendent Cezar Mancao II and Senior Superintendent Glenn Dumlao - all members of Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) headed by then Police Director-General Panfilo Lacson.[10][11]\\r\\nIn his 2001 affidavit, Senior Superintendent Glenn Dumlao implicated then President Joseph Estrada and then Director-General Panfilo Lacson in the DacerÿCorbito Murder Case. Both Estrada and Lacson denied their involvement.[11]\\r\\nIn 2009, Former Police Senior Superintendent Cezar Mancao II named Lacson as the mastermind of the murders of Salvador Dacer and Emmanuel Corbito. The allegations were made in an affidavit that Mancao signed on February 14, 2009. Mancao was allegedly present when Lacson gave the hit order to then Police Senior Superintendent Michael Ray Aquino sometime in October 2000.[12]\\r\\nLacson denied these allegations, stating that the Office of the President had pressured Mancao to sign the affidavit.[12]\\r\\nOn January 5, 2010, Lacson left the Philippines on a Cathay Pacific flight to Hong Kong, shortly before charges against him were filed in court.[13][14][15] He became a fugitive for the next fifteen months. He had been spotted in Hong Kong and Rome but was never apprehended.[16][17]\\r\\nOn February 5, 2010, Branch 18 of the Regional Trial Court in Manila issued an arrest warrant against him.[18] On February 11, 2010, Interpol issued a Red Notice for Lacson.[19][20][21]\\r\\nOn February 3, 2011, the Court of Appeals withdrew the murder charges against the senator. Its decision cited Mancao as \\"not a credible and trustworthy witness\\".[22] Mancao has since turned fugitive after escaping from the custody of the National Bureau of Investigation on May 2013.[23][24]\\r\\nLacson returned to the country on March 26, 2011, a month after the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' ruling on the case.[25][26][27]\\r\\nIn a 2015 interview with the media, Mancao (still a fugitive) apologized to Lacson and Estrada for linking them in the DacerÿCorbito murders, admitting that he had no personal knowledge on the supposed involvement of the two. He also claimed that he was forced by the Arroyo administration to implicate their names.[28][29]\\r\\nLacson was appointed by then President Joseph Estrada to head the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) and to serve as Director-General of the Philippine National Police. Lacson's notable accomplishments were the reduction of corrupt policemen (Kotong Cops) and various organized crime syndicates engaged in kidnapping, drug trafficking, and other nefarious activities. From April 30 to May 1, 2001, together with Juan Ponce Enrile, Gregorio Honasan, Miriam Defensor Santiago and Tito Sotto, he led the EDSA III protests in support of Joseph Estrada.[30][31] On May 1, 2001, the protesters stormed Malaca?ang Palace.[31]\\r\\nLacson ran for senator in the 2001 elections under the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), which was affiliated with Estrada's Puwersa ng Masa coalition. He won a seat in the Senate, finishing in tenth place.\\r\\nIn late 2006, Lacson said he may run as mayor of the city of Manila in the 2007 midterm elections. However, he rescinded that decision and instead ran for re-election for a second Senate term under the Genuine Opposition coalition. He won reelection in the 2007 senatorial elections senatorial elections, ranking third.\\r\\nDuring this time, Lacson proved himself unique by forgoing his Priority Development Assistance Fund or pork barrel. On March 11, 2003, he delivered a privilege speech entitled Living Without Pork, exposing the evils and temptations presented by the pork barrel system, and called for its total abolition. During deliberations on the national budget, he would make sure his PDAF allocation reverted to the National Treasury - in the process saving the government some PhP2.4 billion during his first 12 years in the Senate.\\r\\nIn the Senate, Lacson primarily authored the following:\\r\\nHe was also one of the co-authors of the following laws:\\r\\nLacson filed 41 bills that aimed to improve public service, enhance reproductive health, promote investments, bolster the countrys defense capabilities,\\r\\nLacson was one of the main authors of two milestone legislative measures of the Aquino administration, one of which was the Reproductive Health Act. The measure seeks to promote responsible parenthood and to protect the health of the mother and child by giving them access to reproductive health services. President Benigno Aquino III certified the bill as urgent, allowing Congress to pass it quickly. President Aquino signed it into law as Republic Act 10354 in December 2012. [32]\\r\\nAnother milestone legislative measure where Lacson was a main author was the Sin Tax Reform Act, which imposes higher taxes on tobacco and alcohol products to deter the public from buying such products. Those who insist on buying such products will have to pay higher taxes, whose proceeds will go to the governments universal health program.\\r\\nFor the Sin Tax Reform Act, Lacson had filed Senate Bill No. 2763, which sought to restructure the excise tax on alcohol products; and Senate Bill No. 2764, which sought to restructure the excise tax on tobacco products. President Aquino signed the bill into law as Republic Act 10351. [33]\\r\\nLacson authored Senate Bill No. 2783, which strengthened further the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001. His work is now part of Republic Act No. 10167, which was approved and signed into law on June 18, 2012. [34]\\r\\nLacson also authored a key amendment to the Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Act, which aims to provide more funds to the military for its much-needed capability buildup. President Aquino signed the measure as Republic Act 10349 on December 11, 2012. [35]\\r\\nAlso, Lacson filed Senate Bill No. 2993, An Act Providing for a comprehensive law on firearms, light weapons and ammunitions, which was signed into law as Republic Act 10591. [36]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Lacson also authored the law converting Imus, Cavite from a municipality into a city. The measure became Republic Act No. 10161 on May 8, 2012. [37]\\r\\nLacson also filed Senate Bill No. 2945, which reapportioned the province of Cotabato into three legislative districts. The bill was passed into law as Republic Act 10177. [38]\\r\\nHe filed as well resolutions that led to many officials being held accountable, whether incumbent or former. Among these were:\\r\\nAnother resolution, Resolution No. 660, seeks to congratulate new Cardinal and Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle\\r\\nLacson also filed resolutions commending members of the police and military for safeguarding Filipinos, including:\\r\\nAs fiscalizer in the Senate, Lacson initiated the investigation of the following:\\r\\nLacson ran for President in the 2004 general election against the incumbent President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. His candidacy stirred disagreements with its party president, Senator Edgardo Angara.[39] The COMELEC decided to follow what was done in the Quirino-Avelino case splitting the certificates of votes into half. Angara appealed the case before the Supreme Court and reversed the COMELEC decision. Lacson resigned from the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) upon hearing the news.[40]\\r\\nAfter resigning from the LDP, Lacson continued campaigning as an independent candidate in the elections. He finished third with 10.88% of the vote; ahead of former Senator Raul Roco and Bro. Eddie Villanueva.[41]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of Super Typhoon Yolanda, that caused widespread destruction, substantial damage and death in several areas in the country, particularly in the Visayas Region, President Benigno S. Aquino III appointed Ping Lacson as Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery (PARR) with the mandate of unifying the efforts of government and other agencies involved in the rehabilitation and recovery efforts. As over-all manager and coordinator of rehabilitation, recovery, and reconstruction efforts of government, his office crafted the Yolanda Comprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan (CRRP) with a PhP167 Billion proposed funding, which provides for an over-all strategic vision and integrated short-term, medium-term and long-term programs in the Yolanda-affected areas. Lacson's efforts in the Yolanda rehabilitation lead to the institutionalization of certain mechanisms on rehabilitation of calamity-affected communities.\\r\\nIn December 2014, Lacson tendered his irrevocable resignation as PARR which took effect in February 2015. He recommended the transition of his office's accomplishments and best practices to a permanent government agency. Lacson also viewed the scheduled sunset review of Republic Act 10121, otherwise known as Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010, as an opportune time to propose possible remedial measures that will help improve the effectiveness of the law, especially on the aspect of disaster rehabilitation and recovery.\\r\\nLacson originally planned to run for president in the 2016 election.[42] However, due to low ratings in most pre-election presidential surveys, he decided to run for a senate seat as an independent candidate in the 2016 Philippine general election.[43] He was a guest candidate in the senatorial slates of presidential candidates Jejomar Binay (UNA) and Mar Roxas (LP).[44][45] He was initially listed in Senator Grace Poe's senatorial line-up, but he was eventually replaced by Edu Manzano.[46][47][48] He was also listed in Rodrigo Duterte's (PDPÿLaban) senatorial slate. However, in February 15, 2016, the Duterte-Cayetano tandem dropped their entire senatorial line-up.[49][50]\\r\\nLacson, who endorsed former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas' presidential campaign,[46][51] garnered around 17 million votes in the 2016 elections, earning his way to a Senate seat by ranking fourth in terms of total votes.[52]\\r\\nIn the 17th Congress, Lacson filed Senate Bill 40[53], the Budget Reform for Village Empowerment Act of 2016. The bill seeks to give local government units an active role in nation building by providing them with much-needed funding for their development projects.[54] With the proposed measure, Lacson envisions ending \\"the culture of mendicancy and political patronage\\" while helping realize \\"the elusive inclusive growth that we all aspire for as a nation.\\"\\r\\nLacson filed Senate Bill 41[55], the National Reference Act of 2016, which seeks to establish a National ID system that can help government law enforcers deter criminality and terrorism by facilitating the processes of apprehension and prosecution. The proposed system also seeks to address the problems of constant delays and inconveniences in availing of basic public services and social security benefits due to inefficient and unreliable means of identifying the beneficiaries.[56]\\r\\nLacson also filed Senate Bill 42[57], penalizing a wide range of heinous crimes ranging from drug-related offenses to treason, terrorism and human trafficking.[58]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Lacson filed Senate Bill 48[59], which seeks to amend Republic Act 4200 to update the list of crimes where wiretapping may be deemed lawful under certain circumstances. The measure may give law enforcers more teeth against dangerous crimes like drugs, money-laundering and coups.[60] On Oct. 19, 2016, Lacson sponsored Senate Bill 1210, the proposed Expanded Anti-Wiretapping Act of 2016.[61]\\r\\nOther bills filed by Lacson to curb criminality and corruption include:\\r\\nAlso, Lacson filed bills to ensure professionalism among law enforcers, including:\\r\\nLacson also filed Senate Bill 982, which seeks to shorten processing time for applications to seven days or less.[72]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Lacson filed Senate Bill 257, which assures that parents who enter their twilight years will get support from their children.[73]\\r\\nLacson also filed bills seeking to streamline or update the operations of government agencies, including:\\r\\nBut Lacson also went after abusive law enforcers, including some rogue cops who took advantage of the government's anti-drug war. At a Senate hearing on Jan. 28, 2017, the former PNP chief showed a video of police officers in civilian clothing, appearing to plant evidence in an anti-drug operation - to stress his call for internal cleansing in the PNP.[76]\\r\\nIn late 2016, the Senate realigned P8.3 billion in the proposed 2017 national budget to cover tuition of students in state colleges and universities, after Lacson discovered and moved to take out the \\"pork-like\\" insertions made by the House of Representatives.\\r\\nLacson noted House members were allowed to identify P80 million worth of projects before the submission of the 2017 National Expenditure Program to Congress for deliberations - precisely the pork barrel system already declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.[77]","input":"Who created the presidential anti-organized crime task force?"},{"output":"Philippines","context":"Neolithic age\\r\\nIron age\\r\\nEvents/Artifacts\\r\\n(by geography from North to South)\\r\\nLegendary\\r\\nEvents/Artifacts\\r\\nAmerican colonial period\\r\\nNoli Me Tngere (Latin for Dont Touch Me ) is a novel written by Jos Rizal, one of the national heroes of the Philippines, during the colonization of the country by Spain to describe perceived inequities of the Spanish Catholic priests and the ruling government.\\r\\nOriginally written in Spanish, the book is more commonly published and read in the Philippines in either Tagalog or English. Together with its sequel, El Filibusterismo, the reading of Noli is obligatory for high school students throughout the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRizal entitled this novel as such drawing inspiration from \\"Touch Me Not\\"  the technical name of a particularly painful type of cancer (back in his time, it is unknown what is the modern name of said disease). He proposed to probe all the cancers of Filipino society that everyone else felt too painful to touch. [1]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly English translations of the novel used titles like An Eagle Flight (1900) and The Social Cancer (1912), disregarding the symbolism of the title, but the more recent translations were published using the original Latin title. It has also been noted[citation needed] by the Austro-Hungarian writer Ferdinand Blumentritt that \\"Noli Me Tngere\\" was a name used by ophthalmologists for cancer of the eyelids; that as an ophthalmologist himself Rizal was influenced by this fact is suggested in the novel's dedication, \\"To My household\\".\\r\\nJos Rizal, a Filipino nationalist and medical doctor, conceived the idea of writing a novel that would expose the ills of Philippine society after reading Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. He preferred that the prospective novel express the way Filipino culture was perceived to be backward, anti-progress, anti-intellectual, and not conducive to the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment. He was then a student of medicine in the Universidad Central de Madrid.\\r\\nIn a reunion of Filipinos at the house of his friend Pedro A. Paterno in Madrid on 2 January 1884, Rizal proposed the writing of a novel about the Philippines written by a group of Filipinos. His proposal was unanimously approved by the Filipinos present at the time, among whom were Pedro, Maximino Viola and Antonio Paterno, Graciano L܇pez Jaena, Evaristo Aguirre, Eduardo de Lete, Julio Llorente and Valentin Ventura. However, this project did not materialize. The people who agreed to help Rizal with the novel did not write anything. Initially, the novel was planned to cover and describe all phases of Filipino life, but almost everybody wanted to write about women. Rizal even saw his companions spend more time gambling and flirting with Spanish women. Because of this, he pulled out of the plan of co-writing with others and decided to draft the novel alone.\\r\\nCris܇stomo Ibarra, the mestizo son of recently deceased Don Rafael Ibarra, is returning to San Diego in Laguna after seven years of study in Europe. Capitan Tiago, a family friend, bids him to spend his first night in Manila where Tiago hosts a reunion party at his riverside home on Anloague Street. Cris܇stomo obliges. At dinner he encounters old friends, Manila high society, the new curate of San Diego, and Padre Dmaso, San Diegos old curate at the time Ibarra left for Europe. Dmaso treats Cris܇stomo with hostility, surprising the young man who took the friar to be a friend of his father.\\r\\nCris܇stomo excuses himself early and is making his way back to his hotel when Lieutenant Guevarra, another friend of his father, catches up with him. As the two of them walk to Cris܇stomos stop, and away from the socialites at the party who may possibly compromise them if they heard, Guevarra reveals to the young man the events leading up to Rafaels death and Dmasos role in it. Cris܇stomo, who has been grieving from the time he learned of his fathers death, decides to forgive and not seek revenge. Guevarra nevertheless warns the young man to be careful.\\r\\nThe following day Cris܇stomo returns to Capitan Tiagos home in order to meet with his childhood sweetheart, Tiagos daughter Mara Clara. The two flirt and reminisce in the azotea, a porch overlooking the river. Mara reads back to Cris܇stomo his farewell letter wherein he explained to her Rafaels wish for Cris܇stomo to set out, to study in order to become a more useful citizen of the country. Seeing Cris܇stomo agitated at the mention of his father, however, Mara playfully excuses herself, promising to see him again at her familys San Diego home during the town fiesta.\\r\\nAs the days progress Cris܇stomo carries out his plan to serve his country as his father wanted. He intends to use his family wealth to build a school, believing his paisanos would benefit from a more modern education than what is offered in the schools run by the government, whose curriculum was heavily tempered by the teachings of the friars. Enjoying massive support, and even by the Spanish authorities, Cris܇stomos preparations for his school advance quickly in only a few days. He receives counsel from Don Anastacio, a revered local philosopher, who refers him to a progressive schoolmaster who lamented the friars influence on public education and wished to introduce reforms. The building was planned to begin construction with the cornerstone to be laid in a ceremony during San Diegos town fiesta.\\r\\nOne day, taking a break, Cris܇stomo, Mara, and their friends get on a boat and go on a picnic along the shores of the Laguna de Bay, away from the town center. It is then discovered that a crocodile had been lurking on the fish pens owned by the Ibarras. Elias, the boats pilot, jumps into the water with a bolo knife drawn. Sensing Elias is in danger, Ibarra jumps in as well, and they subdue the animal together. Cris܇stomo mildly scolds the pilot for his rashness, while Elias proclaims himself in Cris܇stomos debt.\\r\\nOn the day of the fiesta, Elias warns Cris܇stomo of a plot to kill him at the cornerstone-laying. The ceremony involved the massive stone being lowered into a trench by a wooden derrick. Cris܇stomo being the principal sponsor of the project is to lay the mortar using a trowel at the bottom of the trench. As he prepares to do so, however, the derrick fails and the stone falls into the trench, bringing the derrick down with it in a mighty crash. When the dust clears, a pale, dust-covered Cris܇stomo stands stiffly by the trench, having narrowly missed the stone. In his place beneath the stone is the would-be assassin. Elias has disappeared.\\r\\nThe festivities continue at Cris܇stomos insistence. Later that day, he hosts a luncheon to which Padre Dmaso invites himself. Over the meal the old friar berates Cris܇stomo, his learning, his journeys, and the schoolbuilding project. The other guests hiss for discretion, but Dmaso ignores them and continues in an even louder voice, insulting the memory of Rafael in front of Cris܇stomo. At the mention of his father, Cris܇stomo strikes the friar unconscious and holds a dinner knife to his neck. In an impassioned speech Cris܇stomo narrates to the astonished guests everything he heard from Lieutenant Guevarra, who was an officer of the local police, about Dmasos schemes that resulted in the death of Rafael. As Cris܇stomo is about to stab Dmaso, however, Mara Clara stays his arm and pleads for mercy.\\r\\nCris܇stomo is excommunicated from the church, but has his excommunication lifted through the intercession of the sympathetic governor general. However, upon his return to San Diego, Mara has turned sickly and refuses to see him. The new curate who Cris܇stomo met at Tiagos dinner, Padre Bernardo Salvi, is seen hovering around the house. Cris܇stomo then meets the inoffensive Linares, a fellow Spaniard who, unlike Cris܇stomo, had been born in Spain. Tiago presents Linares as Maras new suitor.\\r\\nSensing Cris܇stomos influence with the government, Elias takes Cris܇stomo into confidence and one moonlit night, they secretly sail out into the lake. Elias tells him about a revolutionary group, poised for open, violent clash with the government. This group has reached out to Elias in a bid for him to join them in their imminent uprising. Elias tells Cris܇stomo that he managed to delay the groups plans by offering to speak to Cris܇stomo first, that Cris܇stomo may use his influence to effect the reforms Elias and his group wish to see.\\r\\nIn their conversation Elias narrates his familys history, how his grandfather in his youth worked as a bookkeeper in a Manila office but was accused of arson by the Spaniard owner when the office burned down. He was prosecuted and upon release was shunned by the community as a dangerous lawbreaker. His wife turned to prostitution to support the family but eventually they were driven into the hinterlands.\\r\\nCris܇stomo sympathizes with Elias but insists that he could do nothing, and that the only change he was capable of was through his schoolbuilding project. Rebuffed, Elias advises Cris܇stomo to avoid any association with him in the future for his own safety.\\r\\nHeartbroken and desperately needing to speak to Mara, Cris܇stomo turns his focus more towards his school. One evening, though, Elias returns with more information ÿ a rogue uprising was planned for that same night, and the instigators had used Cris܇stomos name in vain to recruit malcontents. The authorities know of the uprising and are prepared to spring a trap on the rebels.\\r\\nIn panic and ready to abandon his project, Cris܇stomo enlists Elias in sorting out and destroying documents in his study that may implicate him. Elias obliges, but comes across a name familiar to him: Don Pedro Eibarramendia. Cris܇stomo tells him that Pedro was his great-grandfather, and that they had to shorten his long family name. Elias tells him Eibarramendia was the same Spaniard who accused his grandfather of arson, and was thus the author of the misfortunes of Elias and his family. Frenzied, he raises his bolo to smite Cris܇stomo, but regains his senses and leaves the house very upset.\\r\\nThe uprising follows through, and many of the rebels are either captured or killed. They point to Cris܇stomo as instructed and Cris܇stomo is arrested. The following morning the instigators are found dead ÿ Elias killed them. Elias furthermore sneaks back into the Ibarra mansion during the night and sorts through documents and valuables, then burns down the house.\\r\\nSome time later Capitan Tiago hosts a dinner at his riverside house in Manila to celebrate Mara Claras engagement with Linares. Present at the party were Padre Dmaso, Padre Salvi, Lieutenant Guevarra, and other family friends. They were discussing the events that happened in San Diego and Cris܇stomos fate.\\r\\nSalvi, who lusted after Mara Clara all along, says that he has requested to be transferred to the Convent of the Poor Clares in Manila under the pretense of recent events in San Diego being too great for him to bear. A despondent Guevarra outlines how the court came to condemn Cris܇stomo. In a signed letter he wrote to a certain woman before leaving for Europe, Cris܇stomo spoke about his father, an alleged rebel who died in prison. Somehow this letter fell into the hands of an enemy, and Cris܇stomo's handwriting was imitated to create the bogus orders used to recruit the malcontents to the San Diego uprising. Guevarra remarks that the penmanship on the orders was similar to Cris܇stomo's penmanship seven years before, but not at the present day. And Cris܇stomo had only to deny that the signature on the original letter was his, and the charge of sedition founded on those bogus letters would fail. But upon seeing the letter, which was the farewell letter he wrote to Mara Clara, Cris܇stomo apparently lost the will to fight the charges and owned the letter as his.\\r\\nGuevarra then approaches Mara, who had been listening to his explanation. Privately but sorrowfully, he congratulates her for her common sense in yielding Cris܇stomos farewell letter. Now, the old officer tells her, she can live a life of peace. Mara is devastated.\\r\\nLater that evening Cris܇stomo, having escaped from prison with the help of Elias, climbs up the azotea and confronts Mara in secret. Mara, distraught, does not deny giving up his farewell letter, but explains she did so only because Salvi found Dmaso's old letters in the San Diego parsonage, letters from Mara's mother who was then pregnant with Mara. It turns out that Dmaso was Mara's father. Salvi promised not to divulge Dmaso's letters to the public in exchange for Cris܇stomos farewell letter. Cris܇stomo forgives her, Mara swears her undying love, and they part with a kiss.\\r\\nCris܇stomo and Elias escape on Elias's boat. They slip unnoticed through the Estero de Binondo and into the Pasig River. Elias tells Cris܇stomo that his treasures and documents are buried in the middle of the forest owned by the Ibarras in San Diego. Wishing to make restitution, Cris܇stomo offers Elias the chance to escape with him to a foreign country, where they will live as brothers. Elias declines, stating that his fate is with the country he wishes to see reformed and liberated.\\r\\nCris܇stomo then tells him of his own desire for revenge and revolution, to lengths that even Elias was unwilling to go. Elias tries to reason with him, but sentries catch up with them at the mouth of the Pasig River and pursue them across Laguna de Bay. Elias orders Cris܇stomo to lie down and to meet with him in a few days at the mausoleum of Cris܇stomo's grandfather in San Diego, as he jumps into the water in an effort to distract the pursuers. Elias is shot several times.\\r\\nThe following day news of the chase were in the newspapers. It is reported that Cris܇stomo Ibarra, the fugitive, had been killed by sentries in pursuit. At the news Mara remorsefully demands of Dmaso that her wedding with Linares be called off and that she be entered into the cloister, or the grave.\\r\\nSeeing her resolution, Dmaso admits the true reason he ruined the Ibarra family and her relationship with Cris܇stomo - because he was a mere mestizo and Dmaso wanted Mara to be as happy as she could be, and that was possible only if she were to marry a full-blooded peninsular Spaniard. Mara would not hear of it and repeated her ultimatum, the cloister or the grave. Knowing fully why Salvi had earlier requested to be assigned as chaplain in the Convent of the Poor Clares, Dmaso pleads with Mara to reconsider, but to no avail. Weeping, Dmaso consents, knowing the horrible fate that awaits his daughter within the convent but finding it more tolerable than her suicide.\\r\\nA few nights later in the forest of the Ibarras, a boy pursues his mother through the darkness. The woman went insane with the constant beating of her husband and the loss of her other son, an altar boy, in the hands of Padre Salvi. Basilio, the boy, catches up with Sisa, his mother, inside the Ibarra mausoleum in the middle of the forest, but the strain had already been too great for Sisa. She dies in Basilio's embrace.\\r\\nBasilio weeps for his mother, but then looks up to see Elias staring at them. Elias was dying himself, having lost a lot of blood and having had no food or nourishment for several days as he made his way to the mausoleum. He instructs Basilio to burn their bodies and if no one comes, to dig inside the mausoleum. He will find treasure, which he is to use for his own education.\\r\\nAs Basilio leaves to fetch the wood, Elias sinks to the ground and says that he will die without seeing the dawn of freedom for his people, and that those who see it must welcome it and not forget them that died in the darkness.\\r\\nRizal finished the novel in December 1886. At first, according to one of Rizal's biographers, Rizal feared the novel might not be printed, and that it would remain unread. He was struggling with financial constraints at the time and thought it would be hard to pursue printing the novel.\\r\\nFinancial aid came from a friend named Mximo Viola; this helped him print the book at Berliner Buchdruckerei-Aktiengesellschaft in Berlin. Rizal was initially hesitant, but Viola insisted and ended up lending Rizal ?300 for 2,000 copies. The printing was finished earlier than the estimated five months. Viola arrived in Berlin in December 1886, and by March 21, 1887, Rizal had sent a copy of the novel to his friend, Blumentritt.[2]\\r\\nThe book was banned by Spanish authorities in the Philippines, although copies were smuggled into the country. The first Philippine edition (and the second published edition) was finally printed in 1899 in Manila by Chofre y Compania in Escolta.\\r\\nOn August 21, 2007, a 480-page English-language version of Noli me tangere was released to major Australian book stores. An Australian edition of the novel was published by Penguin Classics (an imprint by Penguin Books) to represent the company's \\"commitment to publish the major literary classics of the world.\\"[3] American writer Harold Augenbraum, who first read Noli in 1992, translated the novel. A writer well-acquainted with translating other Hispanophone literary works, Augenbraum proposed to translate the novel after being asked for his next assignment in the publishing company. Intrigued by the novel and knowing more about it, Penguin nixed their plan of adapting existing English versions and instead translated it on their own.[3]\\r\\nThis novel and its sequel, El filibusterismo (nicknamed El fili), were banned by Spanish authorities in the Philippines because of their allegations of corruption and abuse by the colonial government and the Catholic Church. Copies of the book were nevertheless smuggled in and hidden, and when Rizal returned to the Philippines after completing medical studies, he quickly ran afoul of the local government. A few days after his arrival, Rizal was summoned to Malaca?an Palace by Governor-General Emilio Terrero, who told him of the charge that Noli me tangere contained subversive elements. After a discussion, Terrero was appeased but still unable to offer resistance to pressure from the Church against the book. The persecution can be discerned from Rizal's letter to Leitmeritz:\\r\\nRizal was exiled to Dapitan in Mindanao, then later arrested for \\"inciting rebellion\\" based largely on his writings. Rizal was executed by firing squad at the Luneta outside Manila's walls on December 30, 1896 at the age of thirty-five, at the park that now bears his name.\\r\\nRizal depicted nationality by emphasizing the positive qualities of Filipinos: the devotion of a Filipina and her influence on a man's life, the deep sense of gratitude, and the solid common sense of the Filipinos under the Spanish regime.\\r\\nThe work was instrumental in creating a unified Filipino national identity and consciousness, as many natives previously identified with their respective regions. It lampooned, caricatured and exposed various elements in colonial society. Two characters in particular have become classics in Filipino culture: Mara Clara, who has become a personification of the ideal Filipino woman, loving and unwavering in her loyalty to her spouse; and the priest Father Dmaso, who reflects the covert fathering of illegitimate children by members of the Spanish clergy.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe book indirectly influenced the Philippine Revolution of independence from the Spanish Empire, even though Rizal actually advocated direct representation to the Spanish government and an overall larger role for the Philippines within Spain's political affairs. In 1956, Congress passed Republic Act 1425, more popularly known as the Rizal Law, which requires all levels in Philippine schools to teach the novel as part of their curriculum. Noli me tangere is being taught to third year secondary school students, while its sequel El filibusterismo is being taught for fourth year secondary school students. The novels are incorporated to their study and survey of Philippine literature.[4] Both of Rizal's novels were initially banned from Catholic educational institutions given its negative portrayal of the Church, but this taboo has been largely superseded as religious schools conformed to the Rizal Law.[citation needed]\\r\\nJuan Cris܇stomo Ibarra y Magsalin, commonly referred to the novel as Ibarra or Cris܇stomo, is the novel's protagonist. The mestizo (mixed-race) son of Filipino businessman Don Rafael Ibarra, he studied in Europe for seven years.[5] Ibarra is also Mara Clara's fianc.\\r\\nMara Clara de los Santos y Alba, commonly referred to as Mara Clara, is Ibarra's fiance and the most beautiful and widely celebrated girl in San Diego.[6] She was raised by Capitn Tiago de los Santos, and his cousin, Isabel. In the later parts of the novel, she was revealed to be an illegitimate daughter of Father Dmaso, the comer curate of the town, and Do?a Pa Alba, Capitn Tiago's wife, who had died giving birth to Mara Clara.[7]\\r\\nAt the novel's end, a heartbroken yet resolved Mara Clara entered the Beaterio de Santa Clara (a nunnery) after learning the truth of her parentage and mistakenly believing her lover Cris܇stomo to have been killed. In the epilogue, Rizal stated that it is unknown if Mara Clara is still living within the walls of the convent or she is already dead.[8]\\r\\nDon Santiago de los Santos, known by his nickname Tiago and political title Kapitn Tiago is it is said that Kapitn Tiago is the richest man in the region of Binondo and he possessed real properties in Pampanga and Laguna de Bay. He is also said to be a good Catholic, a friend of the Spanish government and thus was considered a Spaniard by the colonial elite. Capitn Tiago never attended school, so he became the domestic helper of a Dominican friar who gave him an informal education. He later married Pa Alba from Santa Cruz.[6]\\r\\nDmaso Verdolagas, or Padre Dmaso is a Franciscan friar and the former parish curate of San Diego. He is notorious for speaking with harsh words, highhandedness, and his cruelty during his ministry in the town.[9] An enemy of Cris܇stomo's father, Don Rafael Ibarra, Dmaso is revealed to be Mara Clara's biological father.[7] Later, he and Mara Clara had bitter arguments whether she would marry Alfonso Linares de Espada?a (which he preferred) or to enter the nunnery (her desperate alternative).[10] At the end of the novel, he is again reassigned to a distant town and later found dead in his bed.[8]\\r\\nElas is Ibarra's mysterious friend and ally. Elas made his first appearance as a pilot during a picnic of Ibarra and Mara Clara and her friends.[11]\\r\\nThe 50th chapter of the novel explores the past of Elas and history of his family. About sixty years before the events of Noli me Tangere, Elias's grandfather Ingkong in his youth worked as a bookkeeper in a Manila office. One night the office burned down, and Don Pedro Eibarramendia, the Spaniard owner, accused him of arson. Ingkong was prosecuted and upon release was shunned by the community as a dangerous lawbreaker. His wife Impong turned to prostitution to support themselves but eventually they were driven into the hinterlands. There Impong bore her first son, Balat.\\r\\nDriven to depression, Ingkong hangs himself deep in the forest. Impong was sickly for lack of nourishment in the forest and was not strong enough to cut down his corpse and bury him, and Balat was then still very young. The stench led to their discovery, and Impong was accused of killing her husband. She and her son fled to another province where she bore another son. Balat grew up to be a bandit.\\r\\nEventually Balat's legend grew, but so did the efforts to capture him, and when he finally fell he was cut limb by limb and his head was deposited in front of Impong's house. Seeing the head of her son, Impong died of shock. Impong's younger son, knowing their deaths would somehow be imputed upon him, fled to the province of Tayabas where he met and fell in love with a rich young heiress.\\r\\nThey have an affair and the lady got pregnant. But before they could marry, his records were dug up. Then the father, who disapproved of him from the start, had him imprisoned. The lady gave birth to Elias and his twin sister but died while they were children. Elias and his sister were well cared for, with Elias even going to Ateneo and his sister going to La Concordia, but as they wanted to become farmers they eventually returned to Tayabas.\\r\\nHe and his sister grew up not knowing about their father, being told that their father had long died. Elias grew up to be a young abusive brat who took particular joy in berating an elderly servant who, nevertheless, always submitted to his whims. His sister was more refined and eventually was betrothed to a fine young man. But before they could marry, Elias ran afoul with a distant relative. The relative struck back by telling him about his true parentage. The verbal scuffle mounted to the point where records were dug up, and Elias and his sister, as well as a good part of town, learned the truth. The elderly servant who Elias frequently abused was their father.\\r\\nThe scandal caused the engagement of Elias' sister to break off. Depressed, the girl disappeared one day and was eventually found dead along the shore of the lake. Elias himself lost face before his relatives and became a wanderer from province to province. Like his uncle Balat he became a fugitive and his legend grew, but by degrees he became the gentler, more reserved, and more noble character first introduced in the novel.\\r\\nFilosofo Tacio, known by his Tagalized name Pilosopo Tasyo. Tasyo was enrolled in a philosophy course and was a talented student, but his mother was a rich but superstitious matron. Like many Filipino catholics under the sway of the friars, she believed that too much learning condemned souls to hell. She then made Tasyo choose between leaving college or becoming a priest. Since he was in love, he left college and married.\\r\\nTasyo lost his wife and mother within a year. Seeking consolation and in order to free himself from the cockpit and the dangers of idleness, he took up his studies once more. But he became so addicted to his studies and the purchase of books that he entirely neglected his fortune and gradually ruined himself. Persons of culture called him Don Anastacio, or Pilosopo Tasyo, while the great crowd of the ignorant knew him as Tasyo el Loco on account of his peculiar ideas and his eccentric manner of dealing with others.\\r\\nSeeking for reforms from the government, he expresses his ideals in paper written in a cryptographic alphabet similar from hieroglyphs and Coptic figures[12] hoping \\"that the future generations may be able to decipher it.\\"[13]\\r\\nDo?a Victorina de los Reyes de Espada?a, commonly known as Do?a Victorina, is an ambitious Filipina who classifies herself as a Spanish and mimics Spanish ladies by putting on heavy make-up.[9] The novel narrates Do?a Victorina's younger days: she had lots of admirers, but she spurned them all because none of them were Spaniards. Later on, she met and married Don Tiburcio de Espada?a, an official of the customs bureau ten years her junior.[14] However, their marriage is childless.\\r\\nHer husband assumes the title of medical \\"doctor\\" even though he never attended medical school; using fake documents and certificates, Tiburcio illegally practices medicine. Tiburcio's usage of the title Dr. consequently makes Victorina assume the title Dra. (doctora, female doctor).[14] Apparently, she uses the whole name Do?a Victorina de los Reyes de de Espada?a, with double de to emphasize her marriage surname.[14] She seems to feel that this awkward titling makes her more \\"sophisticated.\\"\\r\\nSisa, Crispn, and Basilio represent a Filipino family persecuted by the Spanish authorities:\\r\\nDue to their tragic but endearing story, these characters are often parodied in modern Filipino popular culture.\\r\\nThere are a number of secondary and minor characters in Noli Me Tngere.

The modern Panchayati Raj and its Gram Panchayats are not to be confused with the extra-constitutional Khap Panchayats (or Caste Panchayats) found in northern India.[1] The Panchayati Raj system was formalized in 1992, following a study conducted by a number of Indian committees on various ways of implementing more decentralized administration.\\r\\nMahatma Gandhi advocated Panchayati Raj as the foundation of India's political system, as a decentralized form of government in which each village would be responsible for its own affairs.[2][3] The term for such a vision was Gram Swaraj (\\"village self-governance\\"). Instead, India developed a highly centralized form of government.[4] However, this has been moderated by the delegation of several administrative functions to the local level, empowering elected gram panchayats. There are significant differences between the traditional Panchayati Raj system, that was envisioned by Gandhi, and the system formalized in India in 1992.[5]\\r\\nIn India, the Panchayati Raj now functions as a system of governance in which gram panchayats are the basic units of local administration. The system has three levels: Gram Panchayat (village level), Mandal Parishad or Block Samiti or Panchayat Samiti (block level), and Zila Parishad (district level).[6] It was formalized in 1992 by the 73rd amendment to the Indian Constitution.[7]\\r\\nVarious committees on Panchayati Raj:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Balwant Rai Mehta Committee, headed by MP Balwantrai Mehta, was a committee appointed by the Government of India in January 1957 to examine the work of the Community Development Programme (1952) and the National Extension Service (1953), to suggest measures to improve their work. The committee's recommendation of the committee by NDC in January 1958, and this set the stage for the launching of Panchayati Raj Institutions throughout the country. The committee recommended the establishment of the scheme of democratic decentralization, which finally came to be known as Panchayati Raj.\\r\\nThis led to the establishment of a three-tier Panchayati Raj system: Gram Panchayat at the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the block level, and Zila Parishad at the district level.\\r\\nThe Panchayat Raj system was first adopted by the state of Rajasthan in Nagaur district on 2nd Oct 1959. The second state was Andhra Pradesh, while Maharashtra was the Ninth state. State governments during the 1950s and 60s adopted this system as laws were passed to establish panchayats in various states. It also founded backing in the Indian Constitution, with the 73rd amendment in 1992 to accommodate the idea. The Amendment Act of 1992 contains provision for devolution of powers and responsibilities to the panchayats, both for the preparation of economic development plans and social justice, as well as for implementation in relation to 29 subjects listed in the eleventh schedule of the constitution, and the ability to levy and collect appropriate taxes, duties, tolls and fees.[8]\\r\\nThe Act aims to provide a three-tier systems of Panchayati Raj for all states having a population of over 2 million, to hold Panchayat elections regularly every five years, to provide seats reserved for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and women; to appoint a State Finance Commission to make recommendations regarding the financial powers of the Panchayats and to constitute a District Planning Committee, to prepare a development plan draft for the district.\\r\\nThe Panchayats receive funds from three sources:[8]\\r\\nIn the history of Panchayati Raj, in India, on 24 April 1993, the Constitutional (73rd Amendment) Act 1992 came into force to provide constitutional status to the Panchayati Raj institutions. This act was extended to Panchayats in the tribal areas of eight states, namely: Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Rajasthan beginning on 24 December 1996. Currently, the Panchayati Raj system exists in all states except Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram, and in all Union Territories except Delhi.[9]\\r\\nA Panchayat Samiti (block panchayat) is a local government body at the tehsil level. This body works for the villages of the tehsil that together are called a \\"development block\\". The Panchayat Samiti is the link between the Gram Panchayat and the district administration. Just as the tehsil goes by other names in various parts of India, notably mandal and taluka, there are a number of variations in nomenclature for the block panchayat. For example, it is known as Mandal Praja Parishad in Andhra Pradesh, Taluka Panchayat in Gujarat and Karnataka, and Panchayat Samiti in Maharashtra. In general, the block panchayat has the same form as the gram panchayat but at a higher level.\\r\\nMembership in the block panchayat is mostly ex-official; it is composed of: all of the Sarpanchas (gram panchayat chairmen) in the Panchayat Samiti area, the MPs and MLAs of the area, the sub-district officer (SDO) of the subdivision, co-opt members (representatives of the SC/ST and women), associate members (a farmer from the area, a representative of the cooperative societies and one from marketing services), and some elected members.\\r\\nThe Panchayat Samiti is elected for a term of five years and is headed by a chairman and a deputy chairman.\\r\\nThe common departments in the Samiti are as follows:\\r\\nThere is an officer for every department. A government-appointed Block Development Officer (BDO) is the executive officer to the Samiti and the chief of its administration, and is responsible for his work to the CEO of ZP.\\r\\nThe governing of the advance system at the district level in Panchayat Raj is also popularly known as Zila Parishad. The chief of administration is an officer of the IAS cadre. and chief officer of the Panchayat raj for the district level\\r\\nThe membership varies from 40 to 60 and usually comprises- Deputy Commissioner of the District. Presidents of all Panchayat Samitis in the district, and heads of all Government Departments in the district;members of Parliament and Members of Legislative Assemblies in the district; a representative of each cooperative society?;some women and Scheduled Caste members if not adequately represented; and co-opted members having extraordinary experience and achievements in public service.\\r\\nA gram panchayat is a village level administrative body, with a Sarpanch as its elected head. The members of the gram panchayat are elected for a period of five years by the members of Gram Sabha.[10]\\r\\nOn August 27, 2009, the Union Cabinet of the Government of India approved 50% reservation for women in PRIs (Panchayati Raj Institutions). The Indian states Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan,Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura , West Bengal and Uttarakhand[11] have implemented 50% reservation for women in PRIs.[12][13] The majority of candidates in these Panchayats are women. Currently 100% of elected members in Kodassery Panchayat in Kerala are women.[14]","input":"What are the objective of the panchayatiraj system?"},{"output":"James Harrison","context":"A refrigerator (colloquially fridge) is a popular household appliance that consists of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump (mechanical, electronic or chemical) that transfers heat from the inside of the fridge to its external environment so that the inside of the fridge is cooled to a temperature below the ambient temperature of the room. Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique in developed countries. The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage. A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water. Optimum temperature range for perishable food storage is 3 to 5?C (37 to 41?F).[1] A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer. The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half. For this reason, a refrigerator is sometimes referred to as an icebox in American usage.\\r\\nThe first cooling systems for food involved using ice. Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s. In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system was built. The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854. In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented. In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. The introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s. Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.\\r\\nFreezer units are used in households and in industry and commerce. Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. The freezer-on-top-and-refrigerator-on-bottom style has been the basic style since the 1940s, until modern refrigerators broke the trend. A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigeratorÿfreezers and freezers. Newer refrigerators may include automatic defrosting, chilled water, and ice from a dispenser in the door.\\r\\nDomestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest is a 4?L Peltier refrigerator advertised as being able to hold 6 cans of beer. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1?m wide with a capacity of 600?L. Refrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen. The refrigerator allows the modern household to keep food fresh for longer than before. Freezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and bulk purchases save money.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the invention of the refrigerator, icehouses were used to provide cool storage for most of the year. Placed near freshwater lakes or packed with snow and ice during the winter, they were once very common. Natural means are still used to cool foods today. On mountainsides, runoff from melting snow is a convenient way to cool drinks, and during the winter one can keep milk fresh much longer just by keeping it outdoors. The word \\"refrigeratory\\" was used at least as early as the 17th century[2]\\r\\nThe history of artificial refrigeration began when Scottish professor William Cullen designed a small refrigerating machine in 1755. Cullen used a pump to create a partial vacuum over a container of diethyl ether, which then boiled, absorbing heat from the surrounding air.[3] The experiment even created a small amount of ice, but had no practical application at that time.\\r\\nIn 1805, American inventor Oliver Evans described a closed vapor-compression refrigeration cycle for the production of ice by ether under vacuum. In 1820, the British scientist Michael Faraday liquefied ammonia and other gases by using high pressures and low temperatures, and in 1834, an American expatriate in Great Britain, Jacob Perkins, built the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system. It was a closed-cycle device that could operate continuously.[4] A similar attempt was made in 1842, by American physician, John Gorrie,[5] who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure. American engineer Alexander Twining took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapor compression system that used ether.\\r\\nThe first practical vapor compression refrigeration system was built by James Harrison, a British journalist who had emigrated to Australia. His 1856 patent was for a vapor compression system using ether, alcohol or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong, Victoria, and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapor-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation.\\r\\nThe first gas absorption refrigeration system using gaseous ammonia dissolved in water (referred to as \\"aqua ammonia\\") was developed by Ferdinand Carr of France in 1859 and patented in 1860. Carl von Linde, an engineering professor at the Technological University Munich in Germany, patented an improved method of liquefying gases in 1876. His new process made possible the use of gases such as ammonia (NH3), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and methyl chloride (CH3Cl) as refrigerants and they were widely used for that purpose until the late 1920s.\\r\\nIn 1913, refrigerators for home and domestic use were invented by Fred W. Wolf of Fort Wayne, Indiana with models consisting of a unit that was mounted on top of an ice box.[6] In 1914, engineer Nathaniel B. Wales of Detroit, Michigan, introduced an idea for a practical electric refrigeration unit, which later became the basis for the Kelvinator. A self-contained refrigerator, with a compressor on the bottom of the cabinet was invented by Alfred Mellowes in 1916. Mellowes produced this refrigerator commercially but was bought out by William C. Durant in 1918, who started the Frigidaire company to mass-produce refrigerators. In 1918, Kelvinator company introduced the first refrigerator with any type of automatic control. The absorption refrigerator was invented by Baltzar von Platen and Carl Munters from Sweden in 1922, while they were still students at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. It became a worldwide success and was commercialized by Electrolux. Other pioneers included Charles Tellier, David Boyle, and Raoul Pictet. Carl von Linde was the first to patent and make a practical and compact refrigerator.\\r\\nThese home units usually required the installation of the mechanical parts, motor and compressor, in the basement or an adjacent room while the cold box was located in the kitchen. There was a 1922 model that consisted of a wooden cold box, water-cooled compressor, an ice cube tray and a 9-cubic-foot (0.25?m3) compartment, and cost $714. (A 1922 Model-T Ford cost about $450.) By 1923, Kelvinator held 80 percent of the market for electric refrigerators. Also in 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit. About this same time porcelain-covered metal cabinets began to appear. Ice cube trays were introduced more and more during the 1920s; up to this time freezing was not an auxiliary function of the modern refrigerator.\\r\\nThe first refrigerator to see widespread use was the General Electric \\"Monitor-Top\\" refrigerator introduced in 1927, so-called because of its resemblance to the gun turret on the ironclad warship USS Monitor of the 1860s. The compressor assembly, which emitted a great deal of heat, was placed above the cabinet, and enclosed by a decorative ring. Over a million units were produced. As the refrigerating medium, these refrigerators used either sulfur dioxide, which is corrosive to the eyes and may cause loss of vision, painful skin burns and lesions, or methyl formate, which is highly flammable, harmful to the eyes, and toxic if inhaled or ingested. Many of these units are still functional today, after requiring little more service than a replacement start relay or thermostat if at all. These cooling systems cannot legally be recharged with the hazardous original refrigerants if they leak or break down.\\r\\nThe introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s and provided a safer, low-toxicity alternative to previously used refrigerants. Separate freezers became common during the 1940s; the popular term at the time for the unit was a deep freeze. These devices, or appliances, did not go into mass production for use in the home until after World War II.[7] The 1950s and 1960s saw technical advances like automatic defrosting and automatic ice making. More efficient refrigerators were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, even though environmental issues led to the banning of very effective (Freon) refrigerants. Early refrigerator models (from 1916) had a cold compartment for ice cube trays. From the late 1920s fresh vegetables were successfully processed through freezing by the Postum Company (the forerunner of General Foods), which had acquired the technology when it bought the rights to Clarence Birdseye's successful fresh freezing methods.\\r\\nThe first successful application of frozen foods occurred when General Foods heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post (then wife of Joseph E. Davies, United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union) deployed commercial-grade freezers in Spaso House, the US Embassy in Moscow, in advance of the Davies arrival. Post, fearful of the USSR's food processing safety standards, fully stocked the freezers with products from General Foods' Birdseye unit. The frozen food stores allowed the Davies to entertain lavishly and serve fresh frozen foods that would otherwise be out of season. Upon returning from Moscow, Post (who resumed her maiden name after divorcing Davies) directed General Foods to market frozen product to upscale restaurants.\\r\\nHome freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes), or as separate units, were introduced in the United States in 1940. Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace.\\r\\nFreezer units are used in households and in industry and commerce. Food stored at or below ?18?C (0?F) is safe indefinitely.[8] Most household freezers maintain temperatures from ?23 to ?18?C (?9 to 0?F), although some freezer-only units can achieve ?34?C (?29?F) and lower. Refrigerators generally do not achieve lower than ?23?C (?9?F), since the same coolant loop serves both compartments: Lowering the freezer compartment temperature excessively causes difficulties in maintaining above-freezing temperature in the refrigerator compartment. Domestic freezers can be included as a separate compartment in a refrigerator, or can be a separate appliance. Domestic freezers are generally upright units resembling refrigerators or chests (upright units laid on their backs). Many modern upright freezers come with an ice dispenser built into their door. Some upscale models include thermostat displays and controls, and sometimes flatscreen televisions as well.\\r\\nCommercial refrigerator and freezer units, which go by many other names, were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models. They used gas systems such as ammonia (R-717) or sulfur dioxide (R-764), which occasionally leaked, making them unsafe for home use. Practical household refrigerators were introduced in 1915 and gained wider acceptance in the United States in the 1930s as prices fell and non-toxic, non-flammable synthetic refrigerants such as Freon-12 (R-12) were introduced. However, R-12 damaged the ozone layer, causing governments to issue a ban on its use in new refrigerators and air-conditioning systems in 1994. The less harmful replacement for R-12, R-134a (tetrafluoroethane), has been in common use since 1990, but R-12 is still found in many old systems today.\\r\\nA common commercial refrigerator is the glass fronted beverage cooler. These type of appliances are typically designed for specific re-load conditions meaning that they generally have a larger cooling system. This ensures that they are able to cope with a large throughput of drinks and frequent door opening. As a result, it is common for these types of commercial refrigerators to have energy consumption of >4 kWh/day.[9]\\r\\nIn the early 1950s most refrigerators were white, but from the mid-1950s through present day designers and manufacturers put color onto refrigerators. In the late-1950s/early-1960s, pastel colors like turquoise and pink became popular, brushed chrome-plating (similar to stainless finish) was available on some models from different brands. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, earth tone colors were popular, including Harvest Gold, Avocado Green and almond. In the 1980s, black became fashionable. In the late 1990s stainless steel came into vogue, and in 2009, one manufacturer introduced multi-color designs.\\r\\nA vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigeratorÿfreezers and freezers. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below the temperature of the refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the condenser; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as auto-refrigeration. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the refrigerator or freezer compartment (\\"box air\\") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.\\r\\nDomestic refrigerators are extremely reliable because the moving parts and fluids are sealed from the atmosphere for life, with no possibility of leakage or contamination. In comparison, mechanically-driven refrigeration compressors, such as those in automobile air conditioning, inevitably leak fluid and lubricant past the shaft seals. This leads to a requirement for periodic recharging and, if ignored, possible compressor failure.\\r\\nAn absorption refrigerator works differently from a compressor refrigerator, using a source of heat, such as combustion of liquefied petroleum gas, solar thermal energy or an electric heating element. These heat sources are much quieter than the compressor motor in a typical refrigerator. A fan or pump might be the only mechanical moving parts; reliance on convection is considered impractical.\\r\\nThe Peltier effect uses electricity to pump heat directly; refrigerators employing this system are sometimes used for camping, or in situations where noise is not acceptable. They can be totally silent (if a fan for air circulation is not fitted) but are less energy-efficient than other methods.\\r\\nOther uses of an absorption refrigerator (or \\"chiller\\") include large systems used in office buildings or complexes such as hospitals and universities. These large systems are used to chill a brine solution that is circulated through the building.\\r\\nMany modern refrigerator/freezers have the freezer on top and the refrigerator on the bottom. Most refrigerator-freezersexcept for manual defrost models or cheaper unitsuse what appears to be two thermostats. Only the refrigerator compartment is properly temperature controlled. When the refrigerator gets too warm, the thermostat starts the cooling process and a fan circulates the air around the freezer. During this time, the refrigerator also gets colder. The freezer control knob only controls the amount of air that flows into the refrigerator via a damper system.[11] Changing the refrigerator temperature will inadvertently change the freezer temperature in the opposite direction. Changing the freezer temperature will have no effect on the refrigerator temperature. The freezer control may also be adjusted to compensate for any refrigerator adjustment.\\r\\nThis means the refrigerator may become too warm. However, because only enough air is diverted to the refrigerator compartment, the freezer usually re-acquires the set temperature quickly, unless the door is opened. When a door is opened, either in the refrigerator or the freezer, the fan in some units stops immediately to prevent excessive frost build up on the freezer's evaporator coil, because this coil is cooling two areas. When the freezer reaches temperature, the unit cycles off, no matter what the refrigerator temperature is. Modern computerized refrigerators do not use the damper system. The computer manages fan speed for both compartments, although air is still blown from the freezer.\\r\\nA few manufacturers offer dual compressor models. These models have separate freezer and refrigerator compartments that operate independently of each other, sometimes mounted within a single cabinet. Each has its own separate compressor, condenser and evaporator coils, insulation, thermostat, and door. Typically, the compressors and condenser coils are mounted at the top of the cabinet, with a single fan to cool them both.\\r\\nThis design, where no air passes between the two compartments, provides for more appropriate humidity levels and much tighter temperature control in each compartment. It also requires much less energy to operate, since each compressor & coolant system can be optimized for a specific temperature range. Further, opening the door of one compartment does not affect the temperature of the air or humidity level in the other compartment. Thus, it avoids many of the disadvantages of the much more common single compressor designs described above, although at a higher initial cost and increased system noise.[citation needed] Manufacturers of such designs argue that the increased cost is compensated over time due to reduced energy use and less food waste due to reduced spoilage.\\r\\nAlternatives to the vapor-compression cycle not in current use include:\\r\\nNewer refrigerators may include:\\r\\nEarly freezer units accumulated ice crystals around the freezing units. This was a result of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the freezer were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing (\\"defrosting\\") of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in automatic defrosting eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the freezer compartment (Freezer Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an electrical heater wire that heated the freezer's walls for a short amount of time to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured freezer compartments located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal freezer door; units featuring an entirely separate freezer compartment were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade. These older freezer compartments were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around ?6?C (21?F), which is suitable for keeping food for a week.\\r\\nIn the early 1950s, the butter conditioner's patent was filed and published by the inventor Nave Alfred E. This feature was supposed to \\"provide a new and improved food storage receptacle for storing butter or the like which may quickly and easily be removed from the refrigerator cabinet for the purpose of cleaning.\\"[13] Because of the high interest to the invention, companies in UK, New Zealand, and Australia started to include the feature into the mass fridge production and soon it became a symbol of the local culture. However, not long after that it was removed from production as according to the companies this was the only way for them to meet new ecology regulations and they found it inefficient to have a heat generating device inside a fridge.\\r\\nLater advances included automatic ice units and self compartmentalized freezing units.\\r\\nAn increasingly important environmental concern is the disposal of old refrigerators initially because freon coolant damages the ozone layerbut as older generation refrigerators wear out, the destruction of CFC-bearing insulation also causes concern. Modern refrigerators usually use a refrigerant called HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane), which does not deplete the ozone layer, instead of Freon. A R-134a is now becoming very uncommon in Europe. Newer refrigerants are being used instead. The main refrigerant now used is R-600a, or isobutane which has a smaller effect on the atmosphere if released. There have been reports of refrigerators exploding if the refrigerant leaks isobutane in the presence of a spark. If the coolant leaks into the fridge, at times when the door is not being opened (such as overnight) the concentration of coolant in the air within the fridge can build up to form an explosive mixture that can be ignited either by a spark from the thermostat or when the light comes on as the door is opened, resulting in documented cases of serious property damage and injury or even death from the resulting explosion.[14]\\r\\nDisposal of discarded refrigerators is regulated, often mandating the removal of doors; children playing hide-and-seek have been asphyxiated while hiding inside discarded refrigerators, particularly older models with latching doors. Since 2 August 1956, under U.S. federal law, refrigerator doors are no longer permitted to latch so they cannot be opened from the inside.[15] Modern units use a magnetic door gasket that holds the door sealed but allows it to be pushed open from the inside.[16] This gasket was invented, developed and manufactured by Max Baermann (1903-1984) of Bergisch Gladbach/Germany.[17]\\r\\nDomestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes. Among the smallest is a 4?L Peltier refrigerator advertised as being able to hold 6 cans of beer. A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about 1?m wide with a capacity of 600?L. Some models for small households fit under kitchen work surfaces, usually about 86?cm high. Refrigerators may be combined with freezers, either stacked with refrigerator or freezer above, below, or side by side. A refrigerator without a frozen food storage compartment may have a small section just to make ice cubes. Freezers may have drawers to store food in, or they may have no divisions (chest freezers).\\r\\nRefrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen.\\r\\nOther specialised cooling mechanisms may be used for cooling, but have not been applied to domestic refrigerators.\\r\\nIn a house without air-conditioning (space heating and/or cooling) refrigerators consumed more energy than any other home device.[21] In the early 1990s a competition was held among the major manufacturers to encourage energy efficiency.[22] Current US models that are Energy Star qualified use 50% less energy than the average models made in 1974.[23] The most energy-efficient unit made in the US consumes about half a kilowatt-hour per day (equivalent to 20 W continuously).[24] But even ordinary units are quite efficient; some smaller units use less than 0.2 kWh per day (equivalent to 8 W continuously). Larger units, especially those with large freezers and icemakers, may use as much as 4?kW{h per day (equivalent to 170 W continuously). The European Union uses a letter-based mandatory energy efficiency rating label instead of the Energy Star; thus EU refrigerators at the point of sale are labelled according to how energy-efficient they are.\\r\\nFor US refrigerators, the Consortium on Energy Efficiency (CEE) further differentiates between Energy Star qualified refrigerators. Tier 1 refrigerators are those that are 20% to 24.9% more efficient than the Federal minimum standards set by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA). Tier 2 are those that are 25% to 29.9% more efficient. Tier 3 is the highest qualification, for those refrigerators that are at least 30% more efficient than Federal standards.[25] About 82% of the Energy Star qualified refrigerators are Tier 1, with 13% qualifying as Tier 2, and just 5% at Tier 3.[26]\\r\\nBesides the standard style of compressor refrigeration used in normal household refrigerators and freezers, there are technologies such as absorption refrigeration and magnetic refrigeration. Although these designs generally use a much larger amount of energy compared to compressor refrigeration, other qualities such as silent operation or the ability to use gas can favor these refrigeration units in small enclosures, a mobile environment or in environments where unit failure would lead to devastating consequences.\\r\\nMany refrigerators made in the 1930s and 1940s were far more efficient than most that were made later. This is partly attributable to the addition of new features, such as auto-defrost, that reduced efficiency. Additionally, after World War 2, refrigerator style became more important than efficiency. This was especially true in the 1970s, when side-by-side models with ice dispensers and water chillers became popular. However, the reduction in efficiency also arose partly from reduction in the amount of insulation to cut costs. Because of the introduction of new energy efficiency standards, refrigerators made today are much more efficient than those made in the 1930s; they consume the same amount of energy while being three times as large.[27][28]\\r\\nThe efficiency of older refrigerators can be improved by defrosting (if the unit is manual defrost) and cleaning them regularly, replacing old and worn door seals with new ones, adjusting the thermostat to accommodate the actual contents (a refrigerator needn't be colder than 4?C (39?F) to store drinks and non-perishable items) and also replacing insulation, where applicable. Some sites recommend you clean condenser coils every month or so on units with coils on the rear. It has been proven that this does very little for improving efficiency,[citation needed] however, the unit should be able to \\"breathe\\" with adequate spaces around the front, back, sides and above the unit. If the refrigerator uses a fan to keep the condenser cool, then this must be cleaned, at the very least, yearly.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrost-free refrigerators or freezers use electric fans to cool the appropriate compartment. This could be called a \\"fan forced\\" refrigerator, whereas manual defrost units rely on colder air lying at the bottom, versus the warm air at the top to achieve adequate cooling. The air is drawn in through an inlet duct and passed through the evaporator where it is cooled, the air is then circulated throughout the cabinet via a series of ducts and vents. Because the air passing the evaporator is supposedly warm and moist, frost begins to form on the evaporator (especially on a freezer's evaporator). In cheaper and/or older models, a defrost cycle is controlled via a mechanical timer. This timer is set to shut off the compressor and fan and energize a heating element located near or around the evaporator for about 15 to 30 minutes at every 6 to 12 hours. This melts any frost or ice build up and allows the refrigerator to work normally once more. It is believed that frost free units have a lower tolerance for frost, due to their air-conditioner like evaporator coils. Therefore, if a door is left open accidentally (especially the freezer), the defrost system may not remove all frost, in this case, the freezer (or refrigerator) must be defrosted.[citation needed]\\r\\nIf the defrosting system melts all the ice before the timed defrosting period ends, then a small device (called a defrost limiter) acts like a thermostat and shuts off the heating element to prevent too large a temperature fluctuation, it also prevents hot blasts of air when the system starts again, should it finish defrosting early. On some early frost-free models, the defrost limiter also sends a signal to the defrost timer to start the compressor and fan as soon as it shuts off the heating element before the timed defrost cycle ends. When the defrost cycle is completed, the compressor and fan are allowed to cycle back on.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrost-free refrigerators, including some early frost free refrigerator/freezers that used a cold plate in their refrigerator section instead of airflow from the freezer section, generally don't shut off their refrigerator fans during defrosting. This allows consumers to leave food in the main refrigerator compartment uncovered, and also helps keep vegetables moist. This method also helps reduce energy consumption, because the refrigerator is above freeze point and can pass the warmer-than-freezing air through the evaporator or cold plate to aid the defrosting cycle.\\r\\nRegarding total life-cycle costs, many governments offer incentives to encourage recycling of old refrigerators. One example is the Phoenix refrigerator program launched in Australia. This government incentive picked up old refrigerators, paying their owners for \\"donating\\" the refrigerator. The refrigerator was then refurbished, with new door seals, a thorough cleaning and the removal of items, such as the cover that is strapped to the back of many older units. The resulting refrigerators, now over 10% more efficient, were then distributed to low income families.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe refrigerator allows the modern family to keep food fresh for longer than before. The most notable improvement is for meat and other highly perishable wares, which needed to be refined to gain anything resembling shelf life.[citation needed] (On the other hand, refrigerators and freezers can also be stocked with processed, quick-cook foods that are less healthy.) Refrigeration in transit makes it possible to enjoy food from distant places.\\r\\nDairy products, meats, fish, poultry and vegetables can be kept refrigerated in the same space within the kitchen (although raw meat should be kept separate from other food for reasons of hygiene).\\r\\nFreezers allow people to buy food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and bulk purchases save money. Ice cream, a popular commodity of the 20th century, could previously only be obtained by traveling to where the product was made and eating it on the spot. Now it is a common food item. Ice on demand not only adds to the enjoyment of cold drinks, but is useful for first-aid, and for cold packs that can be kept frozen for picnics or in case of emergency.\\r\\nSome refrigerators are now divided into four zones to store different types of food:\\r\\nThe capacity of a refrigerator is measured in either liters or cubic feet. Typically the volume of a combined refrigerator-freezer is split with 1/3rds to 1/4th of the volume allocated to the freezer although these values are highly variable.\\r\\nTemperature settings for refrigerator and freezer compartments are often given arbitrary numbers by manufacturers (for example, 1 through 9, warmest to coldest), but generally 3 to 5?C (37 to 41?F)[1] is ideal for the refrigerator compartment and ?18?C (0?F) for the freezer. Some refrigerators must be within certain external temperature parameters to run properly. This can be an issue when placing units in an unfinished area, such as a garage. European freezers, and refrigerators with a freezer compartment, have a four star rating system to grade freezers.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlthough both the three and four star ratings specify the same storage times and same minimum temperature of ?18?C (0?F), only a four star freezer is intended for freezing fresh food, and may include a \\"fast freeze\\" function (runs the compressor continually, down to as low as ?26?C (?15?F)) to facilitate this. Three (or fewer) stars are used for frozen food compartments that are only suitable for storing frozen food; introducing fresh food into such a compartment is likely to result in unacceptable temperature rises. This difference in categorisation is shown in the design of the 4-star logo, where the \\"standard\\" three stars are displayed in a box using \\"positive\\" colours, denoting the same normal operation as a 3-star freezer, and the fourth star showing the additional fresh food/fast freeze function is prefixed to the box in \\"negative\\" colours or with other distinct formatting.[citation needed]\\r\\nMost European refrigerators include a moist cold refrigerator section (which does require (automatic) defrosting at irregular intervals) and a (rarely frost free) freezer section.\\r\\n(from warmest to coolest)[29]","input":"When was the first refrigerator invented and by whom?"},{"output":"over 40 species","context":"Mesquite is a common name for several plants in the genus Prosopis, which contains over 40 species of small leguminous trees. They are native to the southwestern United States and Mexico (except the creeping mesquite, which is native to Argentina, but invasive in southern California). The mesquite originates from the Tamaulipan mezquital ecoregion, in the deserts and xeric shrublands biome, located in the southern United States and northeastern Mexico. The region covers an area of 141,500?km2 (54,600 sq mi), encompassing a portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain in southern Texas, northern Tamaulipas, northeastern Coahuila, and part of Nuevo Le܇n. As a legume, mesquite is one of the few sources of fixed nitrogen in the desert habitat.\\r\\nScrewbean pods.\\r\\nScrewbean flowers\\r\\nHoney mesquite, foliage with seedpods\\r\\nVelvet mesquite dried seeds\\r\\nVelvet mesquite tree\\r\\nHoney mesquite foliage\\r\\nThis tree blooms from spring to summer. It often produces fruits known as \\"pods\\". Prosopis spp are able to grow up to 8 m tall, with regards to site and climate. It is deciduous and depending on location and rainfall can have either deep or shallow roots. Prosopis spp is considered long-lived because of the low mortality rate after the dicotyledonous stage and juveniles are also able to survive in conditions with low light and drought. The Cahuilla indigenous people of western North America were known to eat the seeds of mesquite. [1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProsopis spp has been in North America since the Pliocene era and its wood is dated 3300 yr BP.[2] It is thought to have evolved with megafauna in the New World. The loss of North American megafauna at the end of the Pleistocene era gave way to one theory of how the Prosopis spp was able to survive. One theory is that the loss of the megafauna allowed Prosopis spp to use its fruit pods to attract other organisms to spread its seeds; then with the introduction of livestock it was able to spread into grasslands. Another is that Prosopis spp had always been present in grasslands but recurring fires had delayed plant and seed development before the emergence of livestock and grazing.\\r\\nThe English word mesquite is borrowed from the Spanish word mezquite, which in turn was borrowed from the Nhuatl term mizquitl.[3][4][5]\\r\\nThe mesquite grows as a small shrub in shallow soil or as tall as 50?ft in deep soil with adequate moisture and forms a rounded canopy nearly as wide. They may have one or multiple trunks, a multitude of branches with bipinnate leaflets of a light green to blue hue that cast a light to deep shade depending on the species. Spikes of flowers form in spring and summer that form a flat pod of beans 2-6 inches long. Once the pod is dry the whole pod is edible and can be ground into flour and made into bread. Many varieties form thorns. When cut to the ground level, the tree can often recover. Mesquite is one of the most expensive types of lumber in the US.[citation needed] It was a popular type of wood used by early Spaniards to build ships, but is now used most commonly for high-end rustic furniture and cabinets. Scraps and small pieces are used commonly as wood for cooking with smoke in southern states, and bring a premium on the market.\\r\\nHoney mesquite has been introduced to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia and is considered by the World Conservation Union as one of the world's most problematic invasive species.[6] The spread into grasslands is mostly attributed to the introduction of domestic livestock, although other factors include climate change, overgrazing, and the reduction of fire frequency.[7] Although Prosopis spp is naturally occurring in these areas these changes have resulted in Prosopis spp being able to successfully outcompete other native plants and is now considered an invasive species due to the fact that it was able to take advantage of vulnerable ecosystems.[7]\\r\\nProsopis spp is different from most invasive species because it is highly invasive in its native range as well as introduced ranges. Its impacts on the invaded ecosystems include changes to hydrological, energy, and nutrient cycling, as well as consequences to biodiversity and primary production.[1] Prosopis spp density and canopy cover influence the herbaceous layer and native shrubs and are factors in the changes to the ecosystem.\\r\\nIn the United States, Prosopis spp has become the dominant woody plant on 38,000,000 hectares (94,000,000 acres) of semiarid grasslands. North America is its native range and due to an imbalance within this ecosystem has been able to spread rapidly. It is considered the most common and widely spread pest plant in Texas. It is estimated that about 25% of Texas grasslands are infested and 16 million acres are so invaded that it is suppressing the majority of grass production.[2] In Mexico and the US the two most problematic species are honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina). [7] Australia is also impacted by the introduction of Prosopis spp, in particular, the P. pallida, P. glandulosa, P. velutina, and their hybrid P. juliflora. Prosopis spp is ranked nationally as one of the twenty most significant weeds. It now covers almost 1 million hectares of land. Prosopis spp was originally introduced to help with erosion because of its deep root system.[8] It also has immediate uses to humans through timber and providing a food source through its pods. Since Australia is a hot and semi-arid region, Prosopis spp has been able to become naturalized.\\r\\nIn India Prosopis spp had been introduced decades ago but it wasnt until recently that its effects had been studied. This plant species has been pushing out the Indian wild ass (Equus hemionus khur). [9] This herbivorous mammal eats the pods of Prosopis spp, which is one of the intended purposes of its introduction. Through digesting and excreting the seeds the Indian wild asses are providing the habitat needed for germination. The 5,000 square-kilometer Indian Wild Ass Sanctuary is experiencing mesquite invasion of roughly 1.95 square-kilometers a year. By overtaking the land, the dense canopy cover of Prosopis spp has made it so native vegetation cannot grow. It has also made watering holes inaccessible to the animals within this region. This lack of resources and range is forcing the endangered Indian wild ass into human landscapes and agriculture fields and locals are killing these asses in order to protect their crops.\\r\\nControlling Prosopis spp is a challenging task. One method that is often used is mechanical control. This can be effective with high mortality rates if stems are cut at least 20?cm underground. Another method is through the application of herbicides and this is done on an individual plant basis. Basal application is effective to Prosopis spp of all sizes while foliar application is best for plants smaller than 1.5 m. Another physical option for control is through fires. Some species of mesquite are fire sensitive while others are fire tolerant. For those that are fire sensitive this method can be highly effective but those that are fire tolerant require hot and intense fires to be effective. In Australia scientists are trying biological control methods. They have introduced multiple insects but the most effective in causing high population level impact is the leaf tying moth (Evippe spp).[10] The most recommended method for managing Prosopis, both in native and introduced ranges, is by targeting large amounts of plants either through herbicide or physical removal. There is also new research being done on using satellite and aerial images to assess canopy cover and determine which ranges should be targeted.[11]","input":"How many types of mesquite trees are there?"},{"output":"Video Killed the Radio Star","context":"This is a list of the first music videos broadcast on MTV's first day, August 1, 1981.

(?pronunciation?(help{info)) (30 April 1870 ÿ 16 February 1944), was an Indian producer-director-screenwriter, known as the Father of Indian cinema.[1][2][3] Starting with his debut film, Raja Harishchandra the first indian cinema in 1913, now known as India's first full-length feature, he made 95 movies and 26 short films in his career spanning 19 years, till 1937, including his most noted works: Mohini Bhasmasur (1913), Satyavan Savitri (1914), Lanka Dahan (1917), Shri Krishna Janma (1918) and Kaliya Mardan (1919).[4]\\r\\nThe Dadasaheb Phalke Award, for lifetime contribution to cinema, was instituted in his honour by the Government of India in 1969. The award is one of the most prestigious awards in Indian cinema and is the highest official recognition for film personalities in the country.[5] A postage stamp bearing his face was released by India Post to honour him in 1971. An honorary award from the Dadasaheb Phalke Academy Mumbai was introduced in the year 2001, for lifetime achievement in Indian cinema.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDhundiraj Govind Phalke was born in a Marathi speaking Deshastha Brahmin[7] family on 30 April 1870 at Tryambakeshwar, 30?km from Nashik, Maharashtra, India,[4] where his father was an accomplished scholar.[8]\\r\\nHe joined Sir J. J. School of Art, Mumbai in 1885. After passing from J.J. School in 1890, Phalke went to the Kala Bhavan, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in Vadodara, where he studied sculpture, engineering, drawing, painting and photography.[9]\\r\\nHe began his career as a small town photographer in Godhra but had to leave business after the death of his first wife and child in an outbreak of the bubonic plague. He soon met the German magician Carl Hertz, one of the 40 magicians employed by the Lumiere Brothers. Soon after, he had the opportunity to work with the Archaeological Survey of India as a draftsman. However, restless with his job and its constraints, he turned to the business of printing. He specialised in lithography and oleograph, and worked for painter Raja Ravi Varma. Phalke later started his own printing press, made his first trip abroad to Germany, to learn about the latest technology, machinery and for art also.\\r\\nFollowing a dispute with his partners about the running of the press, he gave up printing and turned his attention to moving pictures, after watching a silent film, The Life of Christ and envisioning Indian gods on the screen. Phalke made his first film, Raja Harishchandra, in 1912; it was first shown publicly on 3 May 1913 at Mumbai's Coronation Cinema,[10] effectively marking the beginning of the Indian film industry. Around one year before, Ramchandra Gopal (known as Dadasaheb Torne) had recorded on stage a film drama called Pundalik and shown recording at the same theatre. However, the credit for making the first indigenous Indian feature film is attributed to Dadasaheb Phalke[11] as it is said that \\"Pundalik\\" had British cinematographers.\\r\\nOnce again, Phalke proved successful in his new art and proceeded to make several silent films, shorts, documentary feature, educational, comic, tapping all the potential of this new medium. Film, having proved its financial viability, soon attracted businessmen who favoured money over aesthetics.\\r\\nPhalke formed a film company, Hindustan Films in partnership with five businessmen from Mumbai, in the hope that by having the financial aspect of his profession handled by experts in the field, he would be free to pursue the creative aspect. He set up a model studio and trained technicians, actors but, very soon, he ran into insurmountable problems with his partners. In 1920, Phalke resigned from Hindustan Films, made his first announcement of retirement from cinema, and he wrote Rangbhoomi an acclaimed play. Lacking his extremely imaginative genius, Hindustan Films ran into deep financial loss, and he was finally persuaded to return. However, Phalke felt constrained by the business and, after directing a few films for the company, he withdrew from it.\\r\\nThe times changed and Phalke fell victim to the emerging technology of sound film. Unable to cope with the talkies, the man who had fathered the Indian film industry became obsolete. His last silent movie Setubandhan was released in 1932 and later released with dubbing. During 1936ÿ38, he produced his last film Gangavataran (1937), before retiring to Nashik, where he died on 16 February 1944.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Marathi film Harishchandrachi Factory, which was directed by theatre veteran Paresh Mokashi and depicts Dadasaheb Phalke's struggle in making Raja Harishchandra in 1913, was selected as India's official entry to the Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category.[13][14][15]","input":"Who is the father of indian film industry?"},{"output":"Ramadan","context":"Ramadan (/?r?m??d?n/; Arabic: ??????? Rama?n, IPA:?[rama?d?a?n];[note 1] also romanized as Ramzan, Ramadhan, or Ramathan) is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar,[3] and is observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting (Sawm) to commemorate the first revelation of the Quran to Muhammad according to Islamic belief.[4][5] This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam.[6] The month lasts 29ÿ30 days based on the visual sightings of the crescent moon, according to numerous biographical accounts compiled in the hadiths.[7][8]\\r\\nThe word Ramadan comes from the Arabic root rami?a or ar-rama?, which means scorching heat or dryness.[9] Fasting is fard (obligatory) for adult Muslims, except those who are suffering from an illness, travelling, are elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, chronically ill or menstruating.[10] Fasting the month of Ramadan was made obligatory (wjib) during the month of Sha'ban, in the second year after the Muslims migrated from Mecca to Medina. Fatwas have been issued declaring that Muslims who live in regions with a natural phenomenon such as the midnight sun or polar night should follow the timetable of Mecca,[11] but the more commonly accepted opinion is that Muslims in those areas should follow the timetable of the closest country to them in which night can be distinguished from day.[12][13][14]\\r\\nWhile fasting from dawn until sunset, Muslims refrain from consuming food, drinking liquids, smoking, and engaging in sexual relations. Muslims are also instructed to refrain from sinful behavior that may negate the reward of fasting, such as false speech (insulting, backbiting, cursing, lying, etc.) and fighting except in self-defense.[15][16] Food and drinks are served daily, before dawn and after sunset, referred to as Suhoor and Iftar respectively.[17][18] Spiritual rewards (thawab) for fasting are also believed to be multiplied within the month of Ramadan.[19] Fasting for Muslims during Ramadan typically includes the increased offering of salat (prayers), recitation of the Quran[20][21] and an increase of doing good deeds and charity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2, Verse 185, of the Quran states:\\r\\nThe month of Ramadan is that in which was revealed the Quran; a guidance for mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the criterion (of right and wrong). And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and whosoever of you is sick or on a journey, a number of other days. Allah desires for you ease; He desires not hardship for you; and that you should complete the period, and that you should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that perhaps you may be thankful.[Quran?2:185]\\r\\nIt is believed that the Quran was first revealed to Muhammad during the month of Ramadan which has been referred to as the \\"best of times\\". The first revelation was sent down on Laylat al-Qadr (The night of Power) which is one of the five odd nights of the last ten days of Ramadan.[22] According to hadith, all holy scriptures were sent down during Ramadan. The tablets of Ibrahim, the Torah, the Psalms, the Gospel and the Quran were sent down on 1st, 6th, 12th, 13th[note 2] and 24th Ramadan respectively.[23]\\r\\nAccording to the Quran, fasting was also obligatory for prior nations, and is a way to attain taqwa, fear of God.[24][Quran?2:183] God proclaimed to Muhammad that fasting for His sake was not a new innovation in monotheism, but rather an obligation practiced by those truly devoted to the oneness of God.[25] The pagans of Mecca also fasted, but only on tenth day of Muharram to expiate sins and avoid droughts.[26]\\r\\nThe ruling to observe fasting during Ramadan was sent down 18 months after Hijra, during the month of Sha'ban in the second year of Hijra in 624 CE.[23]\\r\\nAbu Zanad, an Arabic writer from Iraq who lived after the founding of Islam, in around 747 CE, wrote that at least one Mandaean community located in al-Jazira (modern northern Iraq) observed Ramadan before converting to Islam.[27][not in citation given]\\r\\nAccording to historian Philip Jenkins, Ramadan comes \\"from the strict Lenten discipline of the Syrian Churches\\", a postulation corroborated by other scholars, such as the theologian Paul-Gordon Chandler.[28][29] This suggestion is based on the orientalist idea that the Qur'an itself has Syriac Christian origins, a claim to which some Muslim academics such as M. Al-Azami, object.[30]\\r\\nThe beginning and end of Ramadan are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar.\\r\\nHill (the crescent) is typically a day (or more) after the astronomical new moon. Since the new moon marks the beginning of the new month, Muslims can usually safely estimate the beginning of Ramadan.[31] However, to many Muslims, this is not in accordance with authenticated Hadiths stating that visual confirmation per region is recommended. The consistent variations of a day have existed since the time of Muhammad.[32]\\r\\nThe Arabic Laylat al-Qadr, translated to English is \\"the night of power\\" or \\"the night of decree\\", is considered the holiest night of the year.[33][34] This is the night in which Muslims believe the first revelation of the Quran was sent down to Muhammad stating that this night was \\"better than one thousand months [of proper worship], as stated in Chapter 97:3 of the Qu'ran.\\r\\nAlso, generally, Laylat al-Qadr is believed to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan, i.e., the night of the 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th or 29th. The Dawoodi Bohra Community believe that the 23rd night is laylat al Qadr.[35] [36]\\r\\nThe holiday of Eid al-Fitr (Arabic:??? ?????) marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the next lunar month, Shawwal. This first day of the following month is declared after another crescent new moon has been sighted or the completion of 30 days of fasting if no visual sighting is possible due to weather conditions. This first day of Shawwal is called Eid al-Fitr. Eid al-Fitr may also be a reference towards the festive nature of having endured the month of fasting successfully and returning to the more natural disposition (fitra) of being able to eat, drink and resume intimacy with spouses during the day..[37]\\r\\nThe common practice during Ramadan is fasting from dawn to sunset. The pre-dawn meal before the fast is called the suhur, while the meal at sunset that breaks the fast is the iftar. Considering the high diversity of the global Muslim population, it is impossible to describe typical suhur or iftar meals.\\r\\nMuslims also engage in increased prayer and charity during Ramadan. Ramadan is also a month where Muslims try to practice increased self-discipline. This is motivated by the Hadith, especially in Al-Bukhari[38] and Muslim,[39] that \\"When Ramadan arrives, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of hell are locked up and devils are put in chains.\\"[40]\\r\\nRamadan is a time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship. Muslims are expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam. The fast (sawm) begins at dawn and ends at sunset. In addition to abstaining from eating and drinking, Muslims also increase restraint, such as abstaining from sexual relations[2] and generally sinful speech and behavior. The act of fasting is said to redirect the heart away from worldly activities, its purpose being to cleanse the soul by freeing it from harmful impurities. Ramadan also teaches Muslims how to better practice self-discipline, self-control,[41] sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate; thus encouraging actions of generosity and compulsory charity (zakat).[42]\\r\\nIt becomes compulsory for Muslims to start fasting when they reach puberty, so long as they are healthy and sane, and have no disabilities or illnesses. Many children endeavour to complete as many fasts as possible as practice for later life.\\r\\nExemptions to fasting are travel, menstruation, severe illness, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. However, many Muslims with medical conditions insist on fasting to satisfy their spiritual needs, although it is not recommended by the hadith. Professionals should closely monitor such individuals who decide to persist with fasting.[43] Those who were unable to fast still must make up the days missed later.[44]\\r\\nEach day, before dawn, Muslims observe a pre-fast meal called the suhur. After stopping a short time before dawn, Muslims begin the first prayer of the day, Fajr.[45][46]\\r\\nAt sunset, families hasten for the fast-breaking meal known as iftar. Dates are usually the first food to break the fast; according to tradition, Muhammad broke fast with three dates. Following that, Muslims generally adjourn for the Maghrib prayer, the fourth of the five daily prayers, after which the main meal is served.[47]\\r\\nSocial gatherings, many times in a buffet style, are frequent at iftar. Traditional dishes are often highlighted, including traditional desserts, and particularly those made only during Ramadan. Water is usually the beverage of choice, but juice and milk are also often available, as are soft drinks and caffeinated beverages.[43]\\r\\nIn the Middle East, the iftar meal consists of water, juices, dates, salads and appetizers, one or more main dishes, and various kinds of desserts. Usually, the dessert is the most important part during iftar. Typical main dishes are lamb stewed with wheat berries, lamb kebabs with grilled vegetables, or roast chicken served with chickpea-studded rice pilaf. A rich dessert, such as luqaimat, baklava or kunafeh (a buttery, syrup-sweetened kadaifi noodle pastry filled with cheese), concludes the meal.[48]\\r\\nOver time, iftar has grown into banquet festivals. This is a time of fellowship with families, friends and surrounding communities, but may also occupy larger spaces at masjid or banquet halls for 100 or more diners.[49]\\r\\nCharity is very important in Islam, and even more so during Ramadan. Zakt, often translated as \\"the poor-rate\\", is obligatory as one of the pillars of Islam; a fixed percentage of the person's savings is required to be given to the poor. Sadaqah is voluntary charity in giving above and beyond what is required from the obligation of zakt. In Islam, all good deeds are more handsomely rewarded during Ramadan than in any other month of the year. Consequently, many will choose this time to give a larger portion, if not all, of the zakt that they are obligated to give. In addition, many will also use this time to give a larger portion of sadaqah in order to maximize the reward that will await them at the Last Judgment.[citation needed]\\r\\nTarawih (Arabic: ????????) refers to extra prayers performed by Muslims at night in the Islamic month of Ramadan. Contrary to popular belief, they are not compulsory.[50] However, many Muslims pray these prayers in the evening during Ramadan. Some scholars[who?] maintain that Tarawih is neither fard or a Sunnah, but is the preponed Tahajjud (night prayer) prayer shifted to post-Isha' for the ease of believers. But a majority of Sunni scholars regard the Tarawih prayers as Sunnat al-Mu'akkadah, a salaat that was performed by the Islamic prophet Muhammad very consistently.\\r\\nIn addition to fasting, Muslims are encouraged to read the entire Quran. Some Muslims perform the recitation of the entire Quran by means of special prayers, called Tarawih. These voluntary prayers are held in the mosques every night of the month, during which a whole section of the Quran (juz', which is 1/30 of the Quran) is recited. Therefore, the entire Quran would be completed at the end of the month. Although it is not required to read the whole Quran in the Tarawih prayers, it is common.\\r\\nIn some Muslim countries today, lights are strung up in public squares, and across city streets, to add to the festivities of the month. Lanterns have become symbolic decorations welcoming the month of Ramadan. In a growing number of countries, they are hung on city streets.[51][52][53] The tradition of lanterns as a decoration becoming associated with Ramadan is believed to have originated during the Fatimid Caliphate primarily centered in Egypt, where Caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah was greeted by people holding lanterns to celebrate his ruling. From that time, lanterns were used to light mosques and houses throughout the capital city of Cairo. Shopping malls, places of business, and people's homes can be seen with stars and crescents and various lighting effects, as well.\\r\\nAs the nation with the world's largest Muslim population, Indonesia has diverse Ramadan traditions. On the island of Java, many Javanese Indonesians bathe in holy springs to prepare for fasting, a ritual known as Padusan. The city of Semarang marks the beginning of Ramadan with the Dugderan carnival, which involves parading the Warak ngendog, a horse-dragon hybrid creature allegedly inspired by the Buraq. In the Chinese-influenced capital city of Jakarta, fire crackers were traditionally used to wake people up for morning prayer, until the 19th century. Towards the end of Ramadan, most employees receive a one-month bonus known as Tunjangan Hari Raya. Certain kinds of food are especially popular during Ramadan, such as beef in Aceh, and snails in Central Java. The iftar meal is announced every evening by striking the bedug, a giant drum, in the mosque.\\r\\nCommon greetings during Ramadan are \\"Ramadan Mubarak\\" or \\"Ramadan Kareem\\", which wish the recipient a blessed or generous Ramadan.[54]\\r\\nIn some Muslim countries, failing to fast during Ramadan is considered a crime and is prosecuted as such. For instance, in Algeria, in October 2008 the court of Biskra condemned six people to four years in prison and heavy fines.[55]\\r\\nIn Kuwait, according to law number 44 of 1968, the penalty is a fine of no more than 100 Kuwaiti dinars, (about US$330, GBS260 in May 2017) or jail for no more than one month, or both penalties, for those seen eating, drinking or smoking during Ramadan daytime.[56][57] In some places in the U.A.E., eating or drinking in public during the daytime of Ramadan is considered a minor offence and would be punished by up to 150 hours of community service.[58] In neighbouring Saudi Arabia, described by The Economist as taking Ramadan \\"more seriously than anywhere else\\",[59] there are harsher punishments including flogging, imprisonment and, for foreigners, deportation.[60] In Malaysia, however, there are no such punishments.\\r\\nIn 2014 in Kermanshah, Iran, a non-Muslim was sentenced to having his lips burnt with a cigarette and five Muslims were publicly flogged with 70 stripes for eating during Ramadan.[61][unreliable source?]\\r\\nSome countries have laws that amend work schedules during Ramadan. Under U.A.E. labor law, the maximum working hours are to be 6 hours per day and 36 hours per week. Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait have similar laws.[62]\\r\\nIn Egypt, alcohol sales are banned during Ramadan.[63]\\r\\nSchools all over the world criticize Ramadan. Not eating or drinking can lead to concentration problems and bad grades.[64][65]\\r\\nRamadan fasting is safe for healthy people, but those with medical conditions should seek medical advice.[66] The fasting period is usually associated with modest weight loss, but the weight tends to return afterwards.[67]\\r\\nA review of the literature by an Iranian group suggested fasting during Ramadan might produce renal injury in patients with moderate (GFR <60 ml/min) or worse kidney disease, but was not injurious to renal transplant patients with good function or most stone-forming patients.[68]\\r\\nThe correlation of Ramadan with crime rates is mixed: some statistics show that crime rates drop during Ramadan, while others show that it rises. Decreases in crime rates have been reported by the police in some cities in Turkey (Istanbul[69] and Konya[70]) and the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia.[71] A 2012 study showed that crime rates decreased in Iran during Ramadan, and that the decrease was statistically significant.[72] A 2005 study found that there was a decrease in assault, robbery and alcohol-related crimes during Ramadan in Saudi Arabia, but only the decrease in alcohol-related crimes was statistically significant.[73] Increases in crime rates during Ramadan have been reported in Turkey,[74] Jakarta,[75][76][77] parts of Algeria,[78] Yemen[79] and Egypt.[80]\\r\\nVarious mechanisms have been proposed for the effect of Ramadan on crime:\\r\\nThe length of the dawn to sunset time varies in different parts of the world according to summer or winter solstices of the sun. Most Muslims fast for 11ÿ16 hours during Ramadan. However, in polar regions, the period between dawn and sunset may exceed 22 hours in summers. For example, in 2014, Muslims in Reykjavik, Iceland, and Trondheim, Norway, fasted almost 22 hours, while Muslims in Sydney, Australia, fasted for only about 11 hours. Muslims in areas where continuous night or day is observed during Ramadan follow the fasting hours in the nearest city where fasting is observed at dawn and sunset. Alternatively, Muslims may follow Mecca time.[12][13][14]\\r\\nMuslims will continue to work during Ramadan. The prophet Muhammad said that it is important to keep a balance between worship and work. In some Muslim countries, such as Oman, however, working hours are shortened during Ramadan.[82][83] It is often recommended that working Muslims inform their employers if they are fasting, given the potential for the observance to impact performance at work.[84] The extent to which Ramadan observers are protected by religious accommodation varies by country. Policies putting them at a disadvantage compared to other employees have been met with discrimination claims in the UK and the US.[85][86][87]\\r\\n(federal) = federal holidays, (state) = state holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (week) = weeklong holidays, (month) = monthlong holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\\r\\nBold indicates major holidays commonly celebrated in the United States, which often represent the major celebrations of the month.","input":"What is the muslim month of fasting called?"},{"output":"17% by volume","context":"Baileys Irish Cream is an Irish whiskey- and cream-based liqueur, made by Gilbeys of Ireland. The trademark is currently owned by Diageo. It has a declared alcohol content of 17% by volume.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBaileys Irish Cream was created by Gilbeys of Ireland, a division of International Distillers & Vintners, as it searched for something to introduce to the international market. The process of finding a product began in 1971 and it was introduced in 1974 as the first Irish cream on the market. The Baileys name was granted permission by John Chesterman after Gilbeys asked to use the name from a restaurant that John Chesterman owned. The fictional R.A. Bailey signature was inspired by the Bailey's Hotel in London,[2][3] though the registered trademark omits the apostrophe.  Baileys is produced in Dublin and Mallusk (Northern Ireland).\\r\\n\\r\\nCream and Irish whiskey from various distilleries[4] are homogenized to form an emulsion with the aid of an emulsifier containing refined vegetable oil. The process prevents separation of the alcohol and cream during storage. Baileys contains a proprietary cocoa extract recipe giving Baileys its chocolate character and essence. [5] The quantity of other ingredients is not known but they include herbs and sugar.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the manufacturer, no preservatives are required as the alcohol content preserves the cream. The cream used in the drink comes from Glanbia, an Irish dairy company. Glanbia's Virginia facility in County Cavan produces a range of fat-filled milk powders and fresh cream. It has been the principal cream supplier to Baileys Irish Cream Liqueurs for more than thirty years. At busier times of the year, Glanbia will also supply cream from its Ballyragget facility in Kilkenny.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manufacturer claims Baileys Irish Cream has a shelf life of 24 months and guarantees its taste for two years from the day it was made? opened or unopened, stored in a refrigerator or not? when stored away from direct sunlight at temperatures between 0 and 25?C (32 and 77?F).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiageo provides nutritional information for Baileys.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is the case with milk, cream will curdle whenever it comes into contact with a weak acid. Milk and cream contain casein, which coagulates, when mixed with weak acids such as lemon, tonic water, or traces of wine. While this outcome is undesirable in most situations, some cocktails specifically encourage coagulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, Bailey & Co. launched Baileys Glide, aimed at the alcopop market. It was discontinued in 2006.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, Baileys launched mint chocolate and crme caramel variants at 17% ABV. They were originally released in UK airports and were subsequently released in the mass market of the UK, US, Australia and Canada in 2006. In 2008, Baileys, after the success of previous flavour variants, released a coffee variant, followed by a Hazelnut flavoured variant in 2010.[10] The company trialled a new premium variety, Baileys Gold, at several European airports in 2009.[11] The Gold version also was marketed towards the Japanese consumer.[12] The latest additions to the Baileys flavour family are Biscotti, launched in 2011, and a sub-brand premium product Baileys Chocolat Luxe, which combined Belgian chocolate with Baileys, in 2013. The company released a Vanilla-Cinnamon variety in the US market in 2013 with further flavours, Pumpkin Spice, Espresso and Salted Caramel launching the following year.[13] In 2017, Baileys launched their Pumpkin Spice flavoured liqueur, and in 2018 a \\"Limited Edition\\" Strawberries & Cream was available for a limited time.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational spirit ratings competitions, including at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, the Beverage Testing Institute, and others, have assessed Baileys offerings.

Various forms of pollution have increased as China has industrialised, which has caused widespread environmental and health problems.[1][2][3]\\r\\nChina will either shut down or curtail operations at dozens of steel plants from November 2017, over the next five months under an aggressive action plan to reduce winter pollution in Beijing and its surrounding areas.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immense growth of the People's Republic of China since the 1980s has resulted in increased soil pollution.[citation needed] The State Environmental Protection Administration believes it to be a threat to the environment, food safety and sustainable agriculture. 38,610 square miles (100,000?km2) of Chinas cultivated land have been polluted, with contaminated water being used to irrigate a further 31.5 million miles (21,670?km2.) and another 2 million miles (1,300?km2) have been covered or destroyed by solid waste[citation needed]. The affected area accounts for one-tenth of Chinas cultivatable land. An estimated 6 million tonnes of grain are contaminated by heavy metals every year, causing direct losses of 29 billion yuan (US$2.57 billion)[citation needed]. Heavy metals (including mercury, lead, cadmium, copper, nickel, chromium, and zinc) in the contaminated soil have adverse health effects in human metabolism. Ingestion, contact through skin, diet through the soil-food chain, respiratory intake, and oral intake can deliver the toxic substances to human beings.[5]\\r\\nAs China's waste production increases, insufficient efforts to develop capable recycling systems have been attributed to a lack of environmental awareness.[6] In 2012, the waste generation in China was 300 million tons (229.4?kg/cap/yr).[7]\\r\\nA ban came into effect on 1 June 2008 that prohibited all supermarkets, department stores and shops throughout China from giving out free plastic bags, therefore encouraging people to use cloth bags as during the ancient times.[8] Stores must clearly mark the price of plastic shopping bags and are banned from adding that price onto the price of products. The production, sale and use of ultra-thin plastic bags - those less than 0.025 millimeters (0.00098? in) thick - are also banned. The State Council called for \\"a return to cloth bags and shopping baskets.\\"[9] This ban, however, does not affect the widespread use of paper shopping bags at clothing stores or the use of plastic bags at restaurants for takeout food. A survey by the International Food Packaging Association found that in the year after the ban was implemented, 10 percent fewer plastic bags found their way into the garbage.[10]\\r\\nIn 2011, China produced 2.3 million tons of electronic waste.[11] The annual amount is expected to increase as the Chinese economy grows. In addition to domestic waste production, large amounts of electronic waste are imported from overseas. Legislation banning importation of electronic waste and requiring proper disposal of domestic waste has recently been introduced, but has been criticized as insufficient and susceptible to fraud[citation needed]. There have been local successes, such as in the city of Tianjin where 38,000 tons of electronic waste were disposed of properly in 2010, but much electronic waste is still improperly handled.[12]\\r\\nIn 1997, the World Bank issued a report targeting China's policy towards industrial pollution. The report stated that \\"hundreds of thousands of premature deaths and incidents of serious respiratory illness have been caused by exposure to industrial air pollution. Seriously contaminated by industrial discharges, many of China's waterways are largely unfit for direct human use\\". However, the report did acknowledge that environmental regulations and industrial reforms had had some effect. It was determined that continued environmental reforms were likely to have a large effect on reducing industrial pollution.[13]\\r\\nIn a 2007 article about China's pollution problem, the New York Times stated that \\"Environmental degradation is now so severe, with such stark domestic and international repercussions, that pollution poses not only a major long-term burden on the Chinese public but also an acute political challenge to the ruling Communist Party.\\" The article's main points included:[14]\\r\\nA draft of a 2007 combined World Bank and SEPA report stated that up to 760,000 people died prematurely each year in China because of air and water pollution. High levels of air pollution in China's cities caused to 350,000-400,000 premature deaths. Another 300,000 died because of indoor air of poor quality. There were 60,000 premature deaths each year because of water of poor quality. Chinese officials asked that some of the results should not be published in order to avoid social unrest.[16]\\r\\nChina has made some improvements in environmental protection during recent years. According to the World Bank, 'China is one of a few countries in the world that have been rapidly increasing their forest cover. It is managing to reduce air and water pollution.[17]\\r\\nVennemo et al., in a 2009 literature review in Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, noted the wide discrepancy between the reassuring view in some Chinese official publications and the exclusively negative view in some Western sources. The review stated that \\"although China is starting from a point of grave pollution, it is setting priorities and making progress that resemble what occurred in industrialized countries during their earlier stages of development.\\" Environmental trends were described as uneven. A quality of surface water in the south of China was improving and particle emissions were stable. But NO2 emissions were increasing rapidly and SO2 emissions had been increasing before decreasing in 2007, the last year for which data was available.[18]\\r\\nConventional approaches to air quality monitoring are based on networks of static and sparse measurement stations. However, there are drivers behind current rises in the use of low-cost sensors for air pollution management in cities.[19]\\r\\nThe immense urban growth of Chinese cities substantially increases the need for consumer goods, vehicles and energy. This in turn increases the burning of fossil fuels, resulting in smog. Exposure to Smog poses a threat to the health of Chinese citizens. A study from 2012 shows fine particles in the air, which cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are one of the key pollutants that are accounted for a large fraction of damage on the health of Chinese citizens. [20]\\r\\nThe water resources of China are affected by both severe water shortages and severe water pollution[citation needed]. An increasing population and rapid economic growth, as well as lax environmental oversight, have increased water demand and pollution. According to an investigation in 1980, the entire country has 440 billion cubic meters of the total water consumption. Consumption by agriculture, forestry, husbandry, and country residents was about 88 per cent of the total consumption. However, an investigation shows that 19 per cent of water in main rivers which has been polluted as well as a total length of 95,000 kilometers. In addition, a survey for 878 rivers in the early 1980s shows that 80 per cent of them were polluted to some extent, and fishes became extinct in more than 5 per cent of total river length throughout the country. Furthermore, there are over 20 waterways unsuitable for agricultural irrigation due to water pollution.[21] In response, China has taken measures such as rapidly building out the water infrastructure and increased regulation as well as exploring a number of further technological solutions[citation needed].\\r\\nAir pollution has become a major issue in China and poses a threat to Chinese public health. In 2016, only 84 out of 338 prefecture-level (administrative division of the People's Republic of China (PRC), ranking below a province and above a county) or higher cities attained the national standard for air quality.[23]\\r\\nZhong Nanshan, the president of the China Medical Association, warned in 2012 that air pollution could become China's biggest health threat.[24] Measurements by Beijing municipal government in January 2013 showed that highest recorded level of PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in size), was at nearly 1,000?g per cubic meter.[25] Traces of smog from mainland China has been observed to reach as far as California.[26]\\r\\nSulfur dioxide emission peaked at 2006, after which it began to decline by 10.4% in 2008 compared to 2006.[27] This was accompanied by improvements on related phenomenons such as lower frequency of acid rainfall. The adoption by power plants of flue-gas desulfurization technology was likely the main reason for reduced SO2 emissions.[27]\\r\\nLarge-scale use of formaldehyde in make home building products in construction and furniture also contributes to indoor air pollution.[28]\\r\\nParticulates are formed from both primary and secondary pathways.[29] Primary sources such as coal combustion, biomass combustion and traffic directly emit particulate matter (PM). The emissions from power plants are considerably higher than in other countries, as most Chinese facilities do not employ any flue gas treatment.[30] High secondary aerosol[31] (particulates formed through atmospheric oxidation and reactions of gaseous organic compounds) contribution to particulate pollution in China is found.[32] According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, such fine particles can cause asthma, bronchitis, and acute and chronic respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and painful breathing, and may also lead to premature death.[33]\\r\\nAccording to the World Bank, the Chinese cities with the highest levels of particulate matter in 2004 of those studied were Tianjin, Chongqing, and Shenyang.[34] In 2012 stricter air pollution monitoring of ozone and PM2.5 were ordered to be gradually implemented from large cities and key areas to all prefecture-level cities, and from 2015 all prefecture-level or higher cities were included.[35] State media acknowledged the role of environmental campaigners in causing this change. On one micro-blog service, more than a million mostly positive comments were posted in less than 24 hours although some wondered if the standards would be effectively enforced.[36]\\r\\nThe US embassy in Beijing regularly posts automated air quality measurements at @beijingair on Twitter. On 18 November 2010, the feed described the PM2.5 AQI (Air Quality Index) as \\"crazy bad\\" after registering a reading in excess of 500 for the first time. This description was later changed to \\"beyond index\\",[37] a level which recurred in February, October, and December 2011.[38][39][40]\\r\\nIn June 2012, following strongly divergent disclosures of particulate levels between the Observatory and the US Embassy, Chinese authorities asked foreign consulates to stop publishing \\"inaccurate and unlawful\\" data.[41] Officials said it was \\"not scientific to evaluate the air quality of an area with results gathered from just only one point inside that area\\", and asserted that official daily average PM2.5 figures for Beijing and Shanghai were \\"almost the same with the results published by foreign embassies and consulates\\".[41]\\r\\nBy January 2013 the pollution had worsened with official Beijing data showing an average AQI over 300 and readings of up to 700 at individual recording stations while the US Embassy recorded over 755 on 1 January and 800 by 12 January 2013.[42][43]\\r\\nOn 21 October 2013, record smog closed the Harbin Airport along with all schools in the area. Daily particulate levels of more than 50 times the World Health Organisation recommended daily level were reported in parts of the municipality.[44]\\r\\nIn 2016, Beijing's yearly-average PM2.5 was 73 g/m3, 9.9% improvement compared to 2015. In total, 39 severely polluted days were recorded, 5 fewer compared to 2015.[45]\\r\\nIn an attempt to reduce air pollution, the Chinese government has made the decision to enforce stricter regulations. After record-high air pollution in northern China in 2012 and 2013,[46] the State Council issued an Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution in September 2013. This plan aims to reduce PM2.5 by over 10% from 2012 to 2017.[47] The most prominent government response has been in Beijing, aiming to reduce PM2.5 by 25% from 2012 to 2017.[48] As the capital of China, it is suffering from high levels of air pollution. According to Reuters, in September 2013, the Chinese government published the plan to tackle air pollution problem on its official website.[49] The main goal of the plan is to reduce coal consumption by closing polluting mills, factories, and smelters, and switching to other eco-friendly energy sources.[48]\\r\\nThese policies have been taking effect, and in 2015, the average PM2.5 in 74 key cities in monitoring system is 55 g/m3, showing a 23.6% decrease as of 2013.[50] Despite the reduction in coal consumption and polluting industries, China still maintained a stable economic growth rate from 7.7% in 2013 to 6.9% in 2015.[51]\\r\\nOn 20 August 2015, ahead of the 70th-anniversary celebrations of the end of World War II, the Beijing government shut down industrial facilities and reduced car emissions in order to achieve a \\"Parade Blue\\" sky for the occasion. This action resulted in PM2.5 concentration lower than the 35?g/m3 national air quality standard,[52] according to data from Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Monitoring Centre (BMEMC). The restrictions resulted in an average Beijing PM2.5 concentration of 19.5?g/m3, the lowest that had ever been on record in the capital.[53]\\r\\nChinas strategy has been largely focusing on the development of other energy sources such as nuclear, hydro and compressed natural gas. The latest plan[50] entails closing the outdated capacity of the industrial sectors like iron, steel, aluminum and cement and increasing nuclear capacity and other non-fossil fuel energy. It also includes an intention to stop approving new thermal power plants and to cut coal consumption in industrial areas.[50]\\r\\nAccording to research,[54] substituting all coal consumption for residential and commercial use to natural gas requires additional 88 billion cubic meters of natural gas, which is 60% of China's total consumption in 2012, and the net cost would be 32-52 billion dollars. Substituting the share of coal-fired power plant with renewable and nuclear energy also requires 700GW additional capacity, which cost 184 billion dollars. So the net cost would be 140-160 billion dollars considering value of saved coal.[54] Since all the above policies have been already partially implemented by national and city governments, they should lead to substantial improvements in urban air quality.[54]\\r\\nBeijing launched four-color alert system in 2013. It is based on the air quality index (AQI), which indicates how clean or polluted the air is.[55]\\r\\nThe Beijing government revised their four-color alert system at the start of 2016, increasing the levels of pollution required to trigger orange and red alerts. The change was introduced to standardize the alert levels across four cities including Tianjin and four cities in Hebei, and perhaps in direct response to the red alerts issues the previous December.[56][57]\\r\\nWith active economic growth and a huge number of citizens, China is considered as the largest developing country in the world. Due to urbanization, light pollution generalize is an environmental factor that significantly influences the quality and health of wildlife. According to Pengpeng Han et al., In the 1990s, the increasing trend in light pollution regions mostly occurred in larger urban cities, which are mainly located in eastern and coastal areas, whereas the decreasing trend areas were chiefly industrial and mining cities rich in mineral resources, in addition to the central parts of large cities. In the 2000s, nearly all urban cities were dominated by an uprising trend in light pollution.[58]\\r\\nLead poisoning was described in a 2001 paper as one of the most common pediatric health problems in China. A 2006 review of existing data suggested that one-third of Chinese children suffer from elevated serum lead levels. Pollution from metal smelters and a fast-growing battery industry has been responsible for most cases of particularly high lead levels. In 2011, there were riots in the Zhejiang Haijiu Battery Factory from angry parents whose children received permanent neurological damage from lead poisoning. The central government has acknowledged the problem and has taken measures such as suspending battery factory production, but some see the response as inadequate and some local authorities have tried to silence criticisms.[59]\\r\\nA literature review of academic studies on Chinese children's blood lead levels found that the lead levels declined when comparing the studies published during 1995-2003 and 2004-2007 periods. Lead levels also showed a declining trend after China banned lead in gasoline in 2000. Lead levels were still higher than those in developed nations. Industrial areas had higher levels than suburban areas, which had higher levels than urban areas. Controlling and preventing lead poisoning was described as a long-term mission.[60]\\r\\nChina is a signatory nation of the Stockholm Convention, a treaty to control and phase out major persistent organic pollutants (POP). A plan of action for 2010 includes objectives such as eliminating the production, import and use of the pesticides covered under the convention, as well as an accounting system for PCB containing equipment. For 2015, China plans to establish an inventory of POP-contaminated sites and remediation plans.[61] Since May 2009, this treaty also covers polybrominated diphenyl ethers and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. Perfluorinated compounds are associated with altered thyroid function and decreased sperm count in humans.[62] China faces a big challenge in controlling and eliminating POPs, since they often are cheaper than their alternatives, or are unintentionally produced and then released into the environment to save on treatment costs.\\r\\nThe Yellow dust or Asian dust is a seasonal dust cloud which affects Northeast Asia during late winter and springtime. The dust originates in the deserts of Mongolia, northern China and Kazakhstan where high-speed surface winds and intense dust storms kick up dense clouds of fine, dry soil particles. These clouds are then carried eastward by prevailing winds and pass over Northern China into Korea and Japan.\\r\\nDesertification has intensified in China. 1,740,000?square kilometres of land is classified as \\"dry\\", and desertification disrupts the lives of 400 million people and causes direct economic losses of 54 billion yuan ($7 billion) a year, SFA figures show.[63] Sulfur (an acid rain component), soot, ash, carbon monoxide, and other toxic pollutants including heavy metals (such as mercury, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, lead, zinc, copper) and other carcinogens, often accompany the dust storms, as well as viruses, bacteria, fungi, pesticides, antibiotics, asbestos, herbicides, plastic ingredients, combustion products and hormone mimicking phthalates.[64]\\r\\nThe increasing number of air pollutants can cause incidences of low visibility for days and acid rain. According to the article \\"Air Pollution in Mega Cities in China\\",[65] \\"Coal accounts for 70% of the total energy consumption, and emissions from coal combustion are the major anthropogenic contributors to air pollution in China.\\" The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) also highlights the Haui River Policy established during Chinas central planning period between 1950-1980. The policy provided homes and offices with free coal for winter heating, but was limited solely to the Northern region due to budget limitations. The policy led to a dramatic increase in coal consumption and production. Coal production alongside rapid economic growth has increased the emission of harmful pollutants such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and small particle matter known as PM2.5 and PM10. Chen, Yuyu (2013). \\"Impact of Sustained Exposure to Air Pollution on Life Expectancy from China's Huai River Policy\\". PNAS. National Academy of Sciences. PNAS.

Coal is a huge issue because of the SO2 emissions from coal factories. According to the article, \\"SO2 exceeded the Chinese Grade-II standards in 22% of the countrys cities and caused acid rain problems in 38% of the cities.\\"[65]\\r\\nIn 2010 49 employees at Wintek were poisoned by n-hexane in the manufacturing of touchscreens for Apple products.[66]\\r\\nIn 2013, it was revealed that portions of the country's rice supply were tainted with the toxic metal cadmium.[67]\\r\\nA 2006 Chinese green gross domestic product estimate stated that pollution in 2004 cost 3.05% of the nation's economy.[68]\\r\\nA 2007 World Bank and SEPA report estimated the cost of water and air pollution in 2003 to 2.68% or 5.78% of GDP depending on if using a Chinese or a Western method of calculation.[69]\\r\\nA 2009 review stated a range of 2ÿ10% of GDP.[18]\\r\\nA 2012 study stated that pollution had little effect on economic growth which in China's case was largely dependent on physical capital expansion and increased energy consumption due to the dependency on manufacturing and heavy industries. China was predicted to continue to grow using energy-inefficient and polluting industries. While growth may continue, the rewards of this growth may be opposed by the harm from the pollution unless environmental protection is increased.[70]\\r\\nA 2015 study from the non-profit organization Berkeley Earth estimated that 1.6 million people in China die each year from heart, lung and stroke problems because of polluted air.[71]\\r\\nCritics point to the governments lack of willingness to protect the environment as a common problem with Chinas environmental policies. Even in the case of the latest plan, experts[who?] are skeptical about its actual influence because of the existence of loopholes. This is because economic growth is still the primary issue for the government, and overrides environmental protection[citation needed].\\r\\nHowever, if the measures to cut coal usage were applied strictly, it would also mean the dismantling of the local economy that is highly reliant on heavy industry. The Financial Times interviewed a worker who stated, if this steel mill didnt exist, we wouldnt even have anywhere to go to eat. Everything revolves around this steel factory ÿ our children work here.\\"[72]\\r\\nAs of 2004:\\r\\nAccording to the National Environmental Analysis released by Tsinghua University and The Asian Development Bank in January 2013, 7 of the 10 most air polluted cities in the world are in China, including Taiyuan, Beijing, Urumqi, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Jinan and Shijiazhuang.[74]","input":"What is the cause of smog in china?"},{"output":"The Ties That Bind","context":"The River is the fifth studio album by Bruce Springsteen. It was released on October 17, 1980, by Columbia Records.[1] Springsteen's only double album, The River was produced by Jon Landau, Springsteen, and bandmate Steven Van Zandt. The album was Springsteen's first to go #1 on the Billboard 200 and spent four weeks at the top of chart.[2] \\"The River\\" was nominated for Best Rock Vocal Performance at the 1982 Grammy Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sources of The River go back into earlier parts of Springsteen's recording career. \\"Independence Day\\", \\"Point Blank\\", \\"The Ties That Bind\\", \\"Ramrod\\", and \\"Sherry Darling\\" were leftovers from his previous album, Darkness on the Edge of Town, and had been featured on the 1978 tour, as had parts of \\"Drive All Night\\" as a long interpolation within \\"Backstreets.\\"[3] \\"The River\\" had premiered at the September 1979 Musicians United for Safe Energy concerts, gaining a featured spot in the subsequent documentary No Nukes.[3]\\r\\nOriginally, Springsteen intended The River to be a single set entitled The Ties That Bind and released in late 1979 with 10 tracks.[4] Springsteen added darker material after he'd written the title track. Indeed, The River became noted for its mix of the frivolous next to the solemn. This was intentional, and in contrast to Darkness, for as Springsteen said during an interview, \\"Rock and roll has always been this joy, this certain happiness that is in its way the most beautiful thing in life. But rock is also about hardness and coldness and being alone ... I finally got to the place where I realized life had paradoxes, a lot of them, and you've got to live with them.\\"[5]\\r\\nOn November 8, 2009, at a concert, Bruce Springsteen spoke about the album, saying: \\"The River was a record that was sort of the gateway to a lot of my future writing. It was a record we made after Darkness on the Edge of Town. It was a record made during a recessionhard times in the States. Its title song is a song I wrote for my brother-in-law and sister. My brother-in-law was in the construction industry, lost his job and had to struggle very hard back in the late 70s, like so many people are doing today. It was a record where I first started to tackle men and women and families and marriage. There were certain songs on it that led to complete records later on: 'The River' sort of went to the writing on Nebraska, 'Stolen Car' went to the writing on Tunnel of Love. Originally it was a single record. I handed it in with just one record and I took it back because I didn't feel it was big enough. I wanted to capture the themes I had been writing about on Darkness. I wanted to keep those characters with me and at the same time added music that made our live shows so much fun and joy for our audience. So in the end, we're gonna take you down to The River tonight.\\"[6]\\r\\nIn a contemporary review for Melody Maker, Paolo Hewitt compared listening to The River to \\"taking a trip through the rock 'n' roll heartland as you've never experienced it. It's a walk down all the streets, all the places, all the people and all the souls that rock has ever visited, excited, cried for and loved.\\"[17] Rolling Stone critic Paul Nelson deemed it \\"a rock & roll milestone\\" and said it possesses \\"weighty conclusions, words to live by\\" regarding \\"the second acts of American lives\\", conclusions \\"filled with an uncommon common sense and intelligence that could only have come from an exceptionally warmhearted but wary graduate of the street of hard knocks\\".[18] The River was voted the second best album of 1980 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by The Village Voice. Robert Christgau, its creator and supervisor, wrote of Springsteen in a column accompanying the poll, \\"All the standard objections apply--his beat is still clunky, his singing overwrought, his sense of significance shot through with Mazola Oil. But his writing is at a peak, and he's grown into a bitter empathy. These are the wages of young romantic love among those who get paid by the hour. Maybe he's giving forth with so many short fast ones because the circles of frustration and escape seem even more desperate now.\\"[19] In The New Rolling Stone Record Guide (1983), Dave Marsh called The River \\"by far Springsteen's most mature work, and arguably his most consistent\\".[13] According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, The River was the beginning of 1980s heartland rock.[20] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it at number 253 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[21]\\r\\n\\"Hungry Heart\\" was his first U.S. pop singles chart top ten hit single, reaching number five.[22] (Springsteen had not intended the song to be for himself, having initially written it for The Ramones; manager/producer Jon Landau convinced Springsteen to keep the song for himself.) The album hit number one on the U.S. pop albums chart, a first for Springsteen, and sold 1.6 million copies in the U.S. between its release and Christmas.[23] \\"Fade Away\\" reached number 20.[22]\\r\\nThe album was followed by a lengthy tour of North America and Western Europe during 1980 and 1981.[24] Since its release, The River has been certified quintuple platinum by the RIAA in the U.S., making it one of his best-selling albums and his highest certified studio release after Born in the U.S.A. and Born to Run.[25]\\r\\nAll tracks written by Bruce Springsteen.\\r\\nSpringsteen celebrated the 35th anniversary of The River by releasing a boxed set titled The Ties That Bind: The River Collection on December 4, 2015. The set contains 52 tracks on four CDs along with four hours of video on three DVDs or two Blu-ray discs. The first two CDs feature the remastered version of The River and the third CD contains the previously unreleased The River: Single Album. As is noted above, the single album was originally to be titled The Ties That Bind; it circulated as a bootleg for many years. The fourth CD, The River: Outtakes, spans the entire The River sessions in 1979 and 1980 and contains eleven previously-unreleased outtakes. The fifth disc (DVD or Blu-ray) contains a 60-minute documentary, The Ties That Bind, which was produced and directed by filmmaker Thom Zimny and features an interview with Springsteen as he reflects on writing and recording The River. The film transitions between Springsteen telling the stories behind the musicand illustrating them with solo acoustic guitar performancesinterspersed with period concert footage and photos. The remaining disc(s) feature Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band: The River Tour, Tempe 1980, a new film produced from footage professionally filmed in 1980 using four cameras and recorded in multitrack audio. The film features 23 of 33 songs performed, clocking in at 2 hours, 40 minutes on 2 DVDs (or one Blu-ray), from Springsteens November 5, 1980, concert at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. Also included is 20 minutes of footage from the late September 1980 River Tour rehearsals held in Lititz, Pennsylvania.

The release contained the ten missing songs from the concert video featured in the boxed set.[27]\\r\\nAll tracks written by Bruce Springsteen.\\r\\nUnreleased outtakes Springsteen wrote a large amount of music during album sessions, and even with the 2015 box set, many songs still remain unreleased. Songs such as \\"Held Up Without a Gun\\", \\"Be True\\", and \\"Roulette\\" were featured as B-sides, the first two on the album's singles and the last on a Tunnel of Love single. \\"Mary Lou\\", \\"I Wanna Be with You\\", \\"Bring on the Night\\", \\"Ricky Wants a Man of Her Own\\", \\"Loose Ends\\", \\"Dollhouse\\", \\"Where the Bands Are\\", \\"Living on the Edge of the World\\", \\"Restless Nights\\", \\"Take 'em as They Come\\" were released on the Tracks box set with \\"From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come)\\" on The Essential Bruce Springsteen collection. Prior to the album being recorded, Springsteen had intended to call it The Ties That Bind. Of the songs recorded for that release, most made The River. However, an alternate version of \\"Stolen Car\\" was released on Tracks while a rockabilly version of \\"You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)\\" and \\"Cindy\\" remained officially unreleased until 2015 (though both had been available in bootleg form for some years).[28][29] During The River sessions, Springsteen also recorded \\"Jole Blon\\", \\"Dedication\\", \\"Your Love\\" and \\"This Little Girl\\"  songs he would eventually give to Gary U.S. Bonds for two of his albums on which Springsteen produced and appeared on along with other members of the E Street Band. \\"Janey Needs a Shooter\\" was also given to Warren Zevon, which he re-worked and recorded.[30]\\r\\nThe E Street Band\\r\\nAdditional vocals\\r\\nTechnical\\r\\nThe Ties That Bind: The River Collection\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone","input":"What was the album the river originally called?"},{"output":"250ÿ350 grams","context":"","input":"What is the mass of a human heart?"},{"output":"April 12, 1977","context":"Star Wars comics have been produced by various comic book publishers since the debut of the 1977 film Star Wars. An eponymous series by Marvel Comics began in 1977 with a six-issue comic adaptation of the film and ran for 107 issues until 1986. Blackthorne Publishing released a three-issue run of 3-D comics from 1987 to 1988. Dark Horse published the limited series Star Wars: Dark Empire in 1991, and ultimately produced over 100 Star Wars titles until 2014, including manga adaptations of the original trilogy of films and the 1999 prequel The Phantom Menace. The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012, and the Star Wars comics license returned to Marvel in 2015. In 2017, IDW Publishing launched the anthology series Star Wars Adventures.[1]\\r\\nCharles Lippincott, Lucasfilm's publicity supervisor, initially approached publisher Stan Lee at Marvel Comics in 1975 about publishing a Star Wars comic book prior to the film's release as a means to appeal to its most likely audience. Lee initially declined to consider such a proposal until the film was completed, and was only persuaded otherwise in a second meeting arranged by Roy Thomas, who wanted to edit the series. Since movie tie-in comics rarely sold well at that time, Lee negotiated a publishing arrangement which gave no royalties to Lucasfilm until sales exceeded 100,000. At that point, legal arrangements could be revisited.[2] Issue #1 of Star Wars was released for sale on April 12, 1977,[3][4][5][6] and Marvel published the series from 1977 to 1986, lasting 107 issues and three annuals.[7] According to former Marvel Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of Star Wars comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978.[8] Marvel's Star Wars series was one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980.[9] The only downside for Marvel was that the 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements from a position of strength.[10]\\r\\nIssues #1ÿ6 featured an adaptation of the events of Star Wars by Roy Thomas and artist Howard Chaykin.[11] Original stories began appearing as of issue #7 (January 1978) by the same creative team. Writer Archie Goodwin and artist Carmine Infantino took over the series as of #11 (May 1978).[12] A six-issue adaptation of the 1980 sequel film The Empire Strikes Back by Goodwin and artists Al Williamson and Carlos Garzon appeared in issues #39ÿ44 (September 1980ÿFebruary 1981).[13] Writer David Michelinie and artist Walt Simonson became the new creative team with issue #51 (September 1981).[14] Ron Frenz became the regular artist of the title starting with #71 (May 1983).[15] As of 1984, the Star Wars series was primarily written by Jo Duffy, and art for the final year-and-a-half of the series was by Cynthia Martin.[14]\\r\\nOriginal Star Wars comics were also serialized in the Marvel magazine Pizzazz between 1977 and 1979. The 1977 installments were the first original Star Wars stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the Star Wars comic series.[16] The first story arc, titled \\"The Keeper's World\\", was by Thomas, Chaykin, and Tony DeZuniga, and was later reprinted by Dark Horse Comics. The second story arc, entitled \\"The Kingdom of Ice\\", was by Goodwin, Simonson, Klaus Janson, Dave Cockrum, and John Tartaglione. The final two chapters were scheduled to be printed in issues 17 and 18, but the magazine was cancelled after the 16th issue.

The weekly UK issues split the stories from the US monthly issues into smaller installments, and it usually took around three weekly issues to complete a US monthly issue. The UK comic also published original Star Wars stories by British creators. Star Wars Weekly #1 was published with a free cut-out X-wing fighter on February 8, 1978.[24] It became The Empire Strikes Back Weekly from issue #118 in May 1980, and then became a monthly title from issue #140 in November 1980, reverting to the title Star Wars with issue #159 in July 1982. The monthly comic ran until issue #171 in July 1983, when the numbering was reset at #1 for Return of the Jedi Weekly, which was the first time the UK comic had been printed in color.[25][26][27] This is the title and format that remained until the last issue (#155) was published in June 1986. Further original content was published in issues #94ÿ99, #104ÿ115, #149, #153ÿ157. Throughout this eight-year period, Marvel UK also published several Star Wars annuals and specials.\\r\\nIn 1978, Pendulum Press, under their educational series Contemporary Motivators, also published a 31-page loose adaptation of Star Wars by Linda A.

The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.\\r\\nThe family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series, with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim burned off the episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.\\r\\nSince its debut on January 31, 1999, 289 episodes of Family Guy have been broadcast. Its fifteenth season began on September 25, 2016. Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since The Flintstones in 1961. Family Guy has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons to The Simpsons.\\r\\nMany tie-in media have been released, including Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; Family Guy: Live in Vegas, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the Family Guy universe; and Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy (2010), a series of parodies of the original Star Wars trilogy. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation.\\r\\nA spin-off series, The Cleveland Show, featuring Cleveland Brown, aired from September 27, 2009, to May 19, 2013. \\"The Simpsons Guy\\", a crossover episode with The Simpsons, aired on September 28, 2014.[3] Family Guy is a joint production by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.[4] In 2013, TV Guide ranked Family Guy the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.[5]\\r\\nFamily Guy premiered for a fifteenth season on September 25, 2016. In May 2017, Fox renewed the series for a sixteenth season.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show revolves around the adventures of the Griffin family, consisting of father Peter Griffin, a bumbling yet well-intentioned blue-collar worker; Lois, a stay-at-home mother and piano teacher who is a member of the wealthy Pewterschmidt family; Meg, their often-bullied teenage daughter who is also constantly ridiculed and ignored by the family; Chris, their awkward teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent and a younger version of his father in many respects; and Stewie, their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who has adult mannerisms and uses stereotypical archvillain phrases. Living with the family is their witty, smoking, martini-swilling, sarcastic, English-speaking anthropomorphic dog Brian, though he is still considered a pet in many respects.[7]\\r\\nRecurring characters appear alongside the Griffin family. These include the family's neighbors: sex-crazed airline pilot bachelor Quagmire; African American deli owner Cleveland and his wife Loretta (later Donna); paraplegic police officer Joe, his wife Bonnie, their son Kevin and their baby daughter Susie; neurotic Jewish pharmacist Mort, his wife Muriel, and their geeky and annoying son Neil; and elderly child molester Herbert. TV news anchors Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, and Blaccu-Weather meteorologist Ollie Williams also make frequent appearances. Actors Adam West and James Woods guest star as themselves in various episodes.\\r\\nThe primary setting of Family Guy is Quahog (/?ko?h?/ [pron. ko-hog or kwo-hog]), a fictional district of Providence, Rhode Island that was founded by Peter's ancestor, Griffin Peterson. MacFarlane resided in Providence during his time as a student at Rhode Island School of Design, and the show contains distinct Rhode Island landmarks similar to real-world locations.[8][9] MacFarlane often borrows the names of Rhode Island locations and icons such as Pawtucket and Buddy Cianci for use in the show. MacFarlane, in an interview with a news program on WNAC-TV, Channel 64 in Providence, stated that the town is modeled after Cranston, Rhode Island.[10]\\r\\nMacFarlane initially conceived Family Guy in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).[11] During college, he created his thesis film entitled The Life of Larry,[11] which was submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna-Barbera. MacFarlane was hired by the company.[12] In 1996 MacFarlane created a sequel to The Life of Larry entitled Larry and Steve, which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons.[11]\\r\\nExecutives at Fox saw the Larry shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series, entitled Family Guy, based on the characters.[13] Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, and gave him a budget of $50,000.[14] Several aspects of Family Guy were inspired by the Larry shorts.[15] While working on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian.[13][16] MacFarlane stated that the difference between The Life of Larry and Family Guy was that \\"Life of Larry was shown primarily in my dorm room and Family Guy was shown after the Super Bowl.\\"[15] After the pilot aired, the series was given the green light. MacFarlane drew inspiration from several sitcoms such as The Simpsons and All in the Family.[17] Premises were drawn from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he watched as a child, such as The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang and Rubik, the Amazing Cube.[18]\\r\\nThe Griffin family first appeared on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998.[19] Family Guy was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show MADtv, but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought that that was the place to create a prime-time animation show.[17] Family Guy was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as King of the Hill, but the show was not bought until years later, when King of the Hill became successful.[17] Fox ordered 13 episodes of Family Guy to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.[20]\\r\\nMacFarlane has served as an executive producer during the show's entire history, and also functions as a creative consultant. The first executive producers were David Zuckerman,[36] Lolee Aries, David Pritchard, and Mike Wolf.[37] Family Guy has had many executive producers in its history, including Daniel Palladino, Kara Vallow, and Danny Smith. David A. Goodman joined the show as a co-executive producer in season three, and eventually became an executive producer.[38] Alex Borstein, who voices Lois, worked as an executive and supervising producer for the fourth and fifth seasons.[39]\\r\\nThe first team of writers assembled for the show consisted of Chris Sheridan,[40] Danny Smith, Gary Janetti, Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman, Garrett Donovan, Matt Weitzman, and Mike Barker.[41] The writing process of Family Guy generally starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts; when a script is finished it is given to the rest of the writers to read. These scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason.[42] The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.[17]\\r\\nMacFarlane explains that he is a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology \\"Suspense\\", which led him to give early episodes ominous titles like \\"Death Has a Shadow\\" and \\"Mind Over Murder\\". MacFarlane explained that the team dropped the naming convention after individual episodes became hard to identify, and the novelty wore off.[43] For the first few months of production, the writers shared one office, lent to them by the King of the Hill production crew.[43]\\r\\nCredited with 19 episodes, Steve Callaghan is the most prolific writer on Family Guy staff. Many of the writers that have left the show have gone on to create or produce other successful series. Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan co-wrote 13 episodes for the NBC sitcom Scrubs during their eight-year run on the show, while also serving as co-producers and working their way up to executive producers.[44] Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman left the show and went on to create the long-running and still ongoing adult animated series American Dad! MacFarlane is also a co-creator of American Dad![45][46] On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Barker had departed American Dad! during its run as well, after 10 seasons of serving as producer and co-showrunner over the series.[47]\\r\\nDuring the 2007ÿ2008 Writers Guild of America strike, official production of the show halted for most of December 2007 and for various periods afterward. Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane's final approval, which he termed \\"a colossal dick move\\" in an interview with Variety. Though MacFarlane refused to work on the show, his contract under Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it would subsequently produce.[48] Production officially resumed after the end of the strike, with regularly airing episodes recommencing on February 17, 2008.[49] According to MacFarlane, in 2009, it costs about $2 million to make an episode of Family Guy.[50]\\r\\nDuring his September 2017 AMA on Reddit, MacFarlane revealed that he hadn't written for the show since 2010, focusing instead on production and voice acting.[51].\\r\\nFamily Guy officially premiered after Fox's broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIII on January 31, 1999, with \\"Death Has a Shadow\\". The show debuted to 22 million viewers, and immediately generated controversy regarding its adult content.[52] The show returned on April 11, 1999, with \\"I Never Met the Dead Man\\". Family Guy garnered decent ratings in Fox's 8:30?pm slot on Sunday, scheduled between The Simpsons and The X-Files.[20] At the end of its first season, the show ranked at #33 in the Nielsen ratings, with 12.8 million households tuning in.[53] The show launched its second season in a new time slot, Thursday at 9?pm, on September 23, 1999. Family Guy was pitted against NBC's Frasier, and the series' ratings declined sharply.[20] Subsequently, Fox removed Family Guy from its schedule, and began airing episodes irregularly. The show returned on March 7, 2000, at 8:30?pm on Tuesdays, where it was constantly beaten in the ratings by ABC's then-new breakout hit Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, coming in at #114 in the Nielsen ratings with 6.32 million households tuning in.[54] Fox announced that the show had been canceled in May 2000, at the end of the second season.[55] However, following a last-minute reprieve, on July 24, 2000, Fox ordered 13 additional episodes of Family Guy to form a third season.[52]\\r\\nThe show returned November 8, 2001, once again in a tough time slot: Thursday nights at 8:00?pm ET; this slot brought it into competition with Survivor and Friends (a situation that was later referenced in Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story).[56] During its second and third seasons, Fox frequently moved the show around to different days and time slots with little or no notice and, consequently, the show's ratings suffered.[57] Upon Fox's annual unveiling of its 2002 fall line-up on May 15, 2002, Family Guy was absent.[20] Fox announced that the show had been officially canceled shortly thereafter.[58]\\r\\nFox attempted to sell the rights for reruns of the show, but finding networks that were interested was difficult; Cartoon Network eventually bought the rights, \\"[...] basically for free\\", according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television.[59] Family Guy premiered in reruns on Adult Swim on April 20, 2003, and immediately became the block's top-rated program, dominating late-night viewing in its time period versus cable and broadcast competition, and boosting viewership by 239%.[20][60] The complete first and second seasons were released on DVD the same week the show premiered on Adult Swim, and the show became a cult phenomenon, selling 400,000 copies within one month.[20] Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies,[61] becoming the best-selling television DVD of 2003[62] and the second-highest-selling television DVD ever, behind the first season of Comedy Central's Chappelle's Show.[63] The third-season DVD release also sold more than a million copies.[60] The show's popularity in DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox's interest,[64] and, on May 20, 2004, Fox ordered 35 new episodes of Family Guy, marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales.[63][65]\\r\\n\\"North by North Quahog\\", which premiered May 1, 2005, was the first episode to be broadcast after the show's hiatus. It was written by MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin.[66] MacFarlane believed the show's three-year hiatus was beneficial because animated shows do not normally have hiatuses, and towards the end of their seasons, \\"...?you see a lot more sex jokes and bodily function jokes and signs of a fatigued staff that their brains are just fried\\".[67] With \\"North by North Quahog\\", the writing staff tried to keep the show \\"[...]?exactly as it was\\" before its cancellation, and \\"None of us had any desire to make it look any slicker\\".[67] The episode was watched by 11.85 million viewers,[68] the show's highest ratings since the airing of the first season episode \\"Brian: Portrait of a Dog\\".[69]\\r\\nIn March 2007 comedian Carol Burnett filed a $6 million lawsuit against 20th Century-Fox, claiming that her charwoman cartoon character had been portrayed on the show without her permission. She stated it was a trademark infringement, and that Fox violated her publicity rights.[70][71][72] On June 4, 2007, United States District Judge Dean D. Pregerson rejected the lawsuit, stating that the parody was protected under the First Amendment, citing Hustler Magazine v. Falwell as a precedent.[73]\\r\\nOn October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing the show of infringing its copyright on the song \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\", through a parody song entitled \\"I Need a Jew\\" appearing in the episode \\"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\\". Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a \\"thinly veiled\\" copy of its music with antisemitic lyrics. Named in the suit were 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Co., Cartoon Network, MacFarlane and Murphy; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages.[74] Bourne argued that \\"I Need a Jew\\" uses the copyrighted melody of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.[75][76] On March 16, 2009, United States District Judge Deborah Batts held that Family Guy did not infringe on Bourne's copyright when it transformed the song for comical use in an episode.[77]\\r\\nIn December 2007, Family Guy was again accused of copyright infringement when actor Art Metrano filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature \\"magic\\" act involving absurd \\"faux\\" magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune \\"Fine and Dandy\\".[78] 20th Century Fox, MacFarlane, Callaghan and Borstein were all named in the suit.[79] In July 2009 a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved  \\"purpose and character of the use\\", \\"nature of the infringed work\\" and \\"amount and substantiality of the taking\\"  counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth  \\"economic impact\\"  had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers  not Metrano or his act.[80][81] The case was settled out of court in 2010 with undisclosed terms.[82]\\r\\nSeth MacFarlane voices three of the show's main characters: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, and Stewie Griffin.[83] Since MacFarlane had a strong vision for these characters, he chose to voice them himself, believing it would be easier than for someone else to attempt it.[18] MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design.[84] Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison,[85] especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady.[86] MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian.[18] MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time-only characters, most prominently those of the Griffins' neighbor Glenn Quagmire, news anchor Tom Tucker, and Lois' father, Carter Pewterschmidt.[87]\\r\\nAlex Borstein voices Peter's wife Lois Griffin, Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown, and Lois' mother, Barbara Pewterschmidt.[88] Borstein was asked to provide a voice for the pilot while she was working on MADtv. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork, and said it was \\"really sight unseen\\".[89] At the time, Borstein was performing in a stage show in Los Angeles. She played a redheaded mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins.[88][89]\\r\\nSeth Green primarily voices Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman.[87][90] Green stated that he did an impression of the character Buffalo Bill from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition.[91][92]\\r\\nMila Kunis and Lacey Chabert have both voiced Meg Griffin.[87] Chabert left the series because of time conflicts with schoolwork and her role on Party of Five. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.[93]\\r\\nMike Henry voices Cleveland Brown, Herbert, Bruce the Performance Artist, Consuela and the Greased-up Deaf Guy.[94] Henry met MacFarlane at the Rhode Island School of Design, and kept in touch with him after they graduated.[95] A few years later, MacFarlane contacted him about being part of the show; he agreed and came on as a writer and voice actor.[95] During the show's first four seasons, he was credited as a guest star, but beginning with season five's \\"Prick Up Your Ears\\", he has been credited as a main cast member.[95]\\r\\nOther recurring cast members include Adam West as the eponymous Mayor Adam West;[96] Patrick Warburton as Joe Swanson; Jennifer Tilly as Bonnie Swanson;[97] John G. Brennan as Mort Goldman and Horace the bartender; Carlos Alazraqui as Jonathan Weed;[98][99] Adam Carolla and Norm Macdonald as Death;[100] Lori Alan as Diane Simmons;[101] and Phil LaMarr as Ollie Williams and the judge.[102] Fellow cartoonist Butch Hartman has made guest voice appearances in many episodes as various characters.[103] Also, writer Danny Smith voices various recurring characters, such as Ernie the Giant Chicken.[104] Alexandra Breckenridge also appears as many various characters.\\r\\nEpisodes often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians, and scientists. Many guest voices star as themselves. Leslie Uggams was the first to appear as herself, in the fourth episode of the first season, \\"Mind Over Murder\\".[105] The episode \\"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\\" guest starred the entire cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation, including Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Gates McFadden, Michael Dorn, Wil Wheaton, Marina Sirtis, and even Denise Crosby (season 1 as Tasha Yar), playing themselves; this is the episode with the most guest stars of the seventh season.[106][107]\\r\\nThe \\"Road to\\" episodes are a series of hallmark travel episodes.[108][109][110] They are a parody of the seven Road to... comedy films starring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.[109] These episodes have always involved Stewie and Brian in some foreign, supernatural or science-fiction location, unrelated to the show's normal location in Quahog. The first, entitled \\"Road to Rhode Island\\", aired on May 30, 2000, during the second season. The episodes are known for featuring elaborate musical numbers, similar to the Road films.[111] The episodes contain several trademarks, including a special version of the opening sequence, custom musical cues and musical numbers, and parodies of science fiction and fantasy films.[112]\\r\\nThe original idea for the \\"Road to\\" episodes came from MacFarlane, as he is a fan of the films of Crosby, Hope and Lamour. The first episode was directed by Dan Povenmire, who would direct the rest of the \\"Road to\\" episodes until the episode \\"Road to Rupert\\", at which point he had left the show to create Phineas and Ferb.[113][114] Series regular Greg Colton then took over Povenmire's role as director of the \\"Road to\\" episodes.[115]\\r\\nThe \\"Road to\\" episodes are generally considered by critics and fans to be some of the greatest in the series, thanks to the developing relationship between Stewie and Brian, and the strong plotlines of the episodes themselves.[116]\\r\\nFamily Guy uses the filmmaking technique of cutaways, which occur in the majority of Family Guy episodes.[117] Emphasis is often placed on gags which make reference to current events and/or modern cultural icons.\\r\\nEarly episodes based much of their comedy on Stewie's \\"super villain\\" antics, such as his constant plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions to get rid of things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at matricide. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality.[118] Family Guy often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters break the fourth wall by addressing the audience. For example, in \\"North by North Quahog\\", the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been cancelled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared, Action, That '80s Show, Wonderfalls, Fastlane, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Skin, Girls Club, Cracking Up, The Pitts, Firefly, Get Real, Freakylinks, Wanda at Large, Costello, The Lone Gunmen, A Minute with Stan Hooper, Normal, Ohio, Pasadena, Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie, The $treet, The American Embassy, Cedric the Entertainer Presents, The Tick, Luis, and Greg the Bunny. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during Family Guy's hiatus.[119][120][121]\\r\\nThe show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary characters have them. Notable expressions include Quagmire's \\"Giggity giggity goo\\", Peter's \\"Freakin' sweet\\", and Joe's \\"Bring it on!\\"[118] The use of many of these catchphrases declined in later seasons. The episode \\"Big Man on Hippocampus\\" mocks catchphrase-based humor: when Peter, who has forgotten everything about his life, is introduced to Meg, he exclaims \\"D'oh!\\", to which Lois replies, \\"No, Peter, that's not your catchphrase.\\"[122]\\r\\nIn 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that like other satirical comedies, Family Guy \\"is most popular in cities. The show's popularity was more correlated with support for Hillary Clinton than any other show\\".[123]\\r\\nCatherine Seipp of National Review Online described it as a \\"nasty but extremely funny\\" cartoon.[149] Caryn James of The New York Times called it a show with an \\"outrageously satirical family\\" that \\"includes plenty of comic possibilities and parodies\\".[150] The Sydney Morning Herald named Family Guy the \\"Show of the Week\\" on April 21, 2009, hailing it a \\"pop culture-heavy masterpiece\\".[151] Frazier Moore from The Seattle Times called it an \\"endless craving for humor about bodily emissions\\". He thought it was \\"breathtakingly smart\\" and said a \\"blend of the ingenious with the raw helps account for its much broader appeal\\". He summarized it as \\"rude, crude and deliciously wrong\\".[152] The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin said that Family Guy is becoming one of the best animated shows; she commented on its ribaldry and popularity.[153] The show has become a hit on Hulu; it is the second-highest viewed show after Saturday Night Live.[154] IGN called Family Guy a great show, and commented that it has gotten better since its revival. They stated that they cannot imagine another half-hour sitcom that provides as many laughs as Family Guy.[155] Empire praised the show and its writers for creating really hilarious moments with unlikely material. They commented that one of the reasons they love the show is because nothing is sacredit makes jokes and gags of almost everything.[156] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic praised the series as \\"a different kind of animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do.\\"[157] Family Guy has proven popular in the United Kingdom, regularly obtaining between 700,000 and 1 million viewers for re-runs on BBC Three.[158]\\r\\nThe series has attracted many celebrities. Robert Downey, Jr. telephoned the show production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode's creation, as his son is a fan of the show; the producers subsequently created a character for Downey.[159] Lauren Conrad met MacFarlane while recording a Laguna Beach clip for the episode \\"Prick Up Your Ears\\" (season 5, 2006).[160][161] She has watched Family Guy for years and considers Stewie her favorite character.[160] Commenting on his appearance in the episode \\"Big Man on Hippocampus\\" (season 8, 2010), actor Dwayne Johnson stated that he was a \\"big fan\\" of Family Guy.[162] Johnson befriended MacFarlane after he had a minor role in Johnson's 2010 film Tooth Fairy.[162] R&B singer Rihanna has admitted to being a fan of Family Guy,[163] as has pop singer Britney Spears; she tries to imitate Stewie's English accent.[164] Spears, who was mocked for her personal problems in the South Park episode \\"Britney's New Look\\" in 2008, offered to appear in a cameo to hit back at the similar animated show, but MacFarlane declined, stating that he did not want to start a feud with the series.[165]\\r\\nFamily Guy and its cast have been nominated for 24 Emmy Awards, with 7 wins. MacFarlane won the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance award for his performance as Stewie;[166] Murphy and MacFarlane won the Outstanding Music and Lyrics award for the song \\"You Got a Lot to See\\" from the episode \\"Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows\\";[166] Steven Fonti won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode \\"No Chris Left Behind\\";[167] and Greg Colton won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode \\"Road to the Multiverse\\".[168] The show was nominated for eleven Annie Awards, and won three times, twice in 2006 and once in 2008.[169][170][171] In 2009 it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in this category since The Flintstones in 1961.[172] The Simpsons was almost nominated in 1993, but voters were hesitant to pit cartoons against live action programs.[173][174] The show was nominated for a Grammy in 2011.[175] Family Guy has been nominated and has won various other awards, including the Teen Choice Awards and the People's Choice Awards.[176][177][178] In the 1,000th issue of Entertainment Weekly, Brian Griffin was selected as the dog for \\"The Perfect TV Family\\".[179] Wizard Magazine rated Stewie the 95th-greatest villain of all time.[180] British newspaper The Times rated Family Guy as the 45th-best American show in 2009.[181] IGN ranked Family Guy at number seven in the \\"Top 100 Animated Series\\" and number six in the \\"Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time\\".[155][182] Empire named it the twelfth-greatest TV show of all time.[156] In 2005 viewers of the UK television channel Channel 4 voted Family Guy at number 5 on their list of the 100 Greatest Cartoons.[183] Brian was awarded the 2009 Stoner of the Year award by High Times for the episode \\"420\\", marking the first time an animated character received the honor.[184] In 2007 TV Guide ranked Family Guy number 15 in their list of top cult shows ever.[185] Family Guy has garnered six Golden Reel Awards nominations, winning three times.[186] In 2013, TV Guide ranked Family Guy the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.[5]\\r\\nOne of the initial critics to give the show negative reviews was Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly; he called it \\"The Simpsons as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows\\".[187][188] The Parents Television Council (PTC), a conservative, non-profit watchdog, has attacked the series since its premiere and has branded various episodes as \\"Worst TV Show of the Week\\".[189][190][191] In May 2000 the PTC launched a letter-writing campaign to the Fox network in an effort to persuade the network to cancel the show.[192] The PTC has placed the show on their annual lists of \\"Worst Prime-Time Shows for Family Viewing\\" in 2000, 2005, and 2006.[193][194][195] The Federal Communications Commission has received multiple petitions requesting that the show be blocked from broadcasting on indecency grounds.[196] Tucker and the PTC have both accused the show of portraying religion negatively, and of being racist.[197][198] Because of the PTC, some advertisers have canceled their contracts after reviewing the content of the episodes, claiming it to be unsuitable.[199][200] Critics have compared the show's humor and characters with those of The Simpsons.[187][201]\\r\\nVarious episodes of the show have generated controversy. In \\"420\\" (season seven, 2009) Brian decides to start a campaign to legalize cannabis in Quahog; the Venezuelan government reacted negatively to the episode and banned Family Guy from airing on their local networks, which generally syndicate American programming. Venezuelan justice minister Tareck El Aissami, citing the promotion of the use of cannabis, stated that any cable stations that did not stop airing the series would be fined;[202] the government showed a clip which featured Brian and Stewie singing the praises of marijuana as a demonstration of how the United States supports cannabis use.[203] In \\"Extra Large Medium\\" (season eight, 2010) a character named Ellen (who has Down syndrome) states that her mother is the former Governor of Alaska, which strongly implies that her mother is Sarah Palin, the only woman to have served in the office of governor in the state. Sarah Palin, the mother of a special-needs child, criticized the episode in an appearance on The O'Reilly Factor, calling those who made the show \\"cruel, cold-hearted people.\\"[204]\\r\\nFamily Guy premiered in Australia on April 9, 1999, on the Seven Network, in 2000 on Fox8, and on 7mate on September 27, 2010.[205] In Canada, the series premiered January 31, 1999 on Global[206] and September 1, 2003 on Teletoon. Beginning in the 2015ÿ16 season, the show moved to City.[207] In addition to Teletoon, the show has been syndicated to TVtropolis (now DTour), Adult Swim from July 4, 2012, and FXX.

In January 2005, FX (now Fox) began broadcasting the show.[211] From October 2005, BBC Two[212] started screening Family Guy before switching to BBC Three on September 2006.[213] In March 2015, it was announced that season 14 of Family Guy and all of MacFarlane's other cartoons will transfer to ITV2, premiering on February 29, 2016,[214][215] while the BBC would continue to hold the rights until 2017 for older episodes.[216][217]\\r\\nFamily Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One was written by executive story editor Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and actress Alex Borstein. The book was first published on May 8, 2007.[218] The book is a biographical monologue by Lois Griffin discussing her memories of growing up and to her attempted run for mayor in the town of Quahog. Though the book primarily consists of a loose narrative monologue by Lois, it is also interspersed with sections from other characters such as Peter Griffin. The book covers events featured in the Family Guy episode \\"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\\", with which it shares a title. It was published in the United Kingdom in 2007 by Orion Books.[219]\\r\\nA comic book based on the Family Guy universe was produced. Published by Titan Comics, edited by Steve White and illustrated by Anthony Williams and S. L. Gallant. The writing and the illustrations will be supervised by the show's producers.[220] The first comic book was released on July 27, 2011.[220]\\r\\nAs promotion for the show, and, as Newman described, \\"[to] expand interest in the show beyond its diehard fans\\",[221] Fox organized four Family Guy Live! performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud. The cast also performed musical numbers from the Family Guy: Live in Vegas comedy album.[221] The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 Montreal Comedy Festival.[221] The Family Guy Live! performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each.[222]\\r\\nIn 2007, at the 59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, MacFarlane performed (as the digitally inserted Stewie and Brian) the ceremony's opening number. He performed a song insulting modern television to the tune of the song \\"The Fellas At The Freakin' F.C.C.\\" performed in the episode PTV. The song insulted TV shows such as Two and a Half Men, Desperate Housewives, and Scrubs, as well as the final scene of The Sopranos.\\r\\nIn 2009, a special televised performance show aired entitled Family Guy Presents Seth & Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show, in which voice actors Alex Borstein and MacFarlane performed songs from the show, as well as a parody of Lady Gaga's song \\"Poker Face\\" in the voice of Marlee Matlin, who appeared on stage as a guest during the performance. Some new animated gags also appeared in the show.[223]\\r\\nOn July 22, 2007, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, MacFarlane announced that he may start working on a feature film, although \\"nothing's official.\\"[224] In TV Week on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released Family Guy feature film sometime \\"within the next year.\\"[225] He came up with an idea for the story, \\"something that you could not do on the show, which [to him] is the only reason to do a movie.\\" He later went to say he imagines the film to be \\"an old-style musical with dialogue\\" similar to The Sound of Music, saying that he would \\"really be trying to capture, musically, that feel.\\"[226] On October 13, 2011, Seth MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a Family Guy film had been made, and that it would be written by himself and series co-producer Ricky Blitt.[227]\\r\\nOn November 30, 2012, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a Family Guy film.[228] The project was put on hold while MacFarlane worked on Ted 2.[229]\\r\\nMacFarlane co-createdalongside Mike Henry and Richard Appelthe Family Guy spin-off The Cleveland Show, which premiered September 27, 2009. They began discussing the project in 2007.[230][231] Appel and Henry served as the show's executive producers and showrunners, handling the day-to-day operations, with limited involvement from MacFarlane.[232] Henry and Appel conceived the show as \\"more of a family show, a sweeter show\\" than Family Guy.[233] The first season consisted of 22 episodes,[234] and the show was picked up by Fox for a second season, which consisted of 13 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009, before the first season began.[235] It was extended to a full second season.[236] Appel signed a new three-year, seven-figure deal with Fox to continue serving as showrunner on The Cleveland Show in 2010. Fox chairman Gary Newman commented: \\"What is special about him is his incredible leadership ability.\\"[237] The show follows the Family Guy character Cleveland Brown, who is voiced by Henry, as he leaves the town of Quahog and moves with his son to start his own adventure.[230]\\r\\nFox canceled The Cleveland Show on May 13, 2013, roughly a week before the May 19 conclusion of its fourth season.[238] On July 16, 2013, MacFarlane confirmed an upcoming twelfth season episode of Family Guy centering on Cleveland's return to Quahog.[239]\\r\\nThe Family Guy Video Game! is a 2006 action game released by 2K Games and developed by High Voltage Software. The game received mixed reviews, averaging 50% favorable reviews for the PlayStation 2 version,[240] 51% for the PlayStation Portable version,[241] and 53% for the Xbox version,[242] according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game received praise for its humor,[243] but was criticized for its short playtime[244] and \\"uninteresting gameplay\\".[245] On November 2, 2009, IGN journalist Ryan Langley reported the production of a Family Guy-based party game for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii. He cited the LinkedIn profiles of former HB Studios developer Chris Kolmatycki and Invisible Entertainment co-owner Ron Doucet, which stated that the individuals had worked on the game.[246] MacFarlane recorded exclusive material of Peter's voice and other Family Guy characters for a 2007 pinball machine of the show by Stern Pinball.[247] A game called Family Guy Online was announced.[248]\\r\\nFamily Guy: Back to the Multiverse, which is centered around the episode \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", was released on November 20, 2012.\\r\\nFamily Guy: The Quest for Stuff launched on iOS and Android on April 10, 2014.\\r\\nFamily Guy: Another Freakin Mobile Game was released on iOS on April 25, 2017.[249]\\r\\nAn event known as \\"Night of the Hurricane\\" depicts a hurricane hitting the hometowns of MacFarlane's sitcoms Family Guy, American Dad! and The Cleveland Show, culminating in a stand-off among the three fathers of each family.\\r\\nIt was announced that a special episode of Family Guy featuring an official crossover with The Simpsons would premiere in 2014.

Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8?m in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range of RDW-CV in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%.[1] If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause.\\r\\nDeficiencies of Vitamin B12 or folate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two-thirds of all cases. However, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of both iron and B12 deficiencies, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis.[2]\\r\\nAn elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias. Anemia of chronic disease, hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) may all present with a normal RDW.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"width\\" in RDW-CV is sometimes thought to be \\"misleading,\\" since it in fact is a measure of deviation of the volume of RBCs, and not directly the diameter.

Thus, it is a reasonably accurate term.[4][5]\\r\\nMathematically, the RDW-CV is calculated with the following formula:\\r\\nAnemia in the presence of a normal RDW may suggest thalassemia. A low Mentzer Index, calculated from CBC data, may suggest this disorder but a hemoglobin electrophoresis would be diagnostic.\\r\\nIron Deficiency Anemia: usually presents with high RDW with low MCV\\r\\nFolate and vitamin B12 deficiency anemia: usually presents with high RDW and high MCV\\r\\nMixed Deficiency (Iron + B12 or folate) anemia: usually presents with high RDW and variable MCV\\r\\nRecent Hemorrhage: typical presentation is high RDW with normal MCV\\r\\nA false high RDW reading can occur if EDTA anticoagulated blood is used instead of citrated blood.

The modern Christmas tree was developed in medieval Livonia (present-day Estonia and Latvia) and early modern Germany, where Protestant Germans brought decorated trees into their homes.[1][2] It acquired popularity beyond the Lutheran areas of Germany[1][3] and the Baltic countries during the second half of the 19th century, at first among the upper classes.[4]\\r\\nThe tree was traditionally decorated with \\"roses made of colored paper, apples, wafers, tinsel, [and] sweetmeats\\". In the 18th century, it began to be illuminated by candles, which were ultimately replaced by Christmas lights after the advent of electrification. Today, there is a wide variety of traditional ornaments, such as garlands, baubles, tinsel, and candy canes. An angel or star might be placed at the top of the tree to represent the Angel Gabriel or the Star of Bethlehem from the Nativity.[5][6] Edible items such as gingerbread, chocolate and other sweets are also popular and are tied to or hung from the tree's branches with ribbons.\\r\\nIn the Western Christian tradition, Christmas trees are variously erected on days such as the first day of Advent or even as late as Christmas Eve depending on the country;[7] customs of the same faith hold that the two traditional days when Christmas decorations, such as the Christmas tree, are removed are Twelfth Night and, if they are not taken down on that day, Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some denominations.[7][8]\\r\\nThe Christmas tree is sometimes compared with the \\"Yule-tree\\", especially in discussions of its folkloric origins.[9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relevance of ancient pre-Christian customs to the 16th-century German initiation of the Christmas tree custom is disputed. Resistance to the custom was often because of its supposed Lutheran origins.[12]\\r\\nOther sources have offered a connection between the first documented Christmas trees in Alsace around 1600 and pre-Christian traditions. For example, according to the Encyclop?dia Britannica, \\"The use of evergreen trees, wreaths, and garlands to symbolize eternal life was a custom of the ancient Egyptians, Chinese, and Hebrews. Tree worship was common among the pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting up a tree for the birds during Christmas time.\\"[13]\\r\\nDuring the Roman mid-winter festival of Saturnalia, houses were decorated with wreaths of evergreen plants, along with other antecedent customs now associated with Christmas.[14]\\r\\nThe modern Christmas tree is frequently traced to the symbolism of trees in pre-Christian winter rites, wherein Viking and Saxon worshiped trees.[14] The story of Saint Boniface cutting down Donar's Oak illustrates the pagan practices in 8th century among the Germans. A later folk version of the story adds the detail that an evergreen tree grew in place of the felled oak, telling them about how its triangular shape reminds humanity of the Trinity and how it points to heaven.[15][16]\\r\\nAlternatively, it is identified with the \\"tree of paradise\\" of medieval mystery plays that were given on 24 December, the commemoration and name day of Adam and Eve in various countries. In such plays, a tree decorated with apples (to represent the forbidden fruit) and wafers (to represent the Eucharist and redemption) was used as a setting for the play. Like the Christmas crib, the Paradise tree was later placed in homes. The apples were replaced by round objects such as shiny red balls.[10][11][17][18][19][20]\\r\\nAt the end of the Middle Ages, an early predecessor appears referred in the Regiment of the Order of Cister around 1400, in Alcoba?a, Portugal. The Regiment of the local high-Sacristans of the Cistercian Order refers to what may be considered one of the oldest references to the Christmas tree: \\"Note on how to put the Christmas branch, scilicet: On the Christmas eve, you will look for a large Branch of green laurel, and you shall reap many red oranges, and place them on the branches that come of the laurel, specifically as you have seen, and in every orange you shall put a candle, and hang the Branch by a rope in the pole, which shall be by the candle of the altar-mor.\\"[21]\\r\\nModern Christmas trees originated during the Renaissance of early modern Germany. Its 16th-century origins are sometimes associated with Protestant Christian reformer Martin Luther, who is said to have first added lighted candles to an evergreen tree.[22][23][24]\\r\\nThe first recorded Christmas tree can be found on the keystone sculpture of a private home in Turckheim, Alsace (then part of Germany, today France), dating 1576.[25]\\r\\nGeorgians have their own traditional Christmas tree called Chichilaki, made from dried up hazelnut or walnut branches that are shaped to form a small coniferous tree. These pale-colored ornaments differ in height from 20?cm (7.9?in) to 3 meters (9.8 feet). Chichilakis are most common in the Guria and Samegrelo regions of Georgia near the Black Sea, but they can also be found in some stores around the capital of Tbilisi.[citation needed] Georgians believe that Chichilaki resembles the famous beard of St. Basil the Great, because Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates St.?Basil on January 1.\\r\\nThere was an old pagan custom, associated with Koliada, of suspending a branch of fir, spruce or pine called Pod?a?niczka from the ceiling. The branches were decorated with apples, nuts, cookies, colored paper, stars made of straw, ribbons and colored wafers. Some people believed that the tree had magical powers that were linked with harvesting and success in the next year.\\r\\nIn the late 18th and early 19th century, these traditions were almost completely replaced by the German custom of decorating the Christmas tree.\\r\\nCustoms of erecting decorated trees in wintertime can be traced to Christmas celebrations in Renaissance-era guilds in Northern Germany and Livonia. The first evidence of decorated trees associated with Christmas Day are trees in guildhalls decorated with sweets to be enjoyed by the apprentices and children. In Livonia (present-day Estonia and Latvia), in 1441, 1442, 1510 and 1514, the Brotherhood of Blackheads erected a tree for the holidays in their guild houses in Reval (now Tallinn) and Riga. On the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays, the tree was taken to the Town Hall Square, where the members of the brotherhood danced around it.[26]\\r\\nA Bremen guild chronicle of 1570 reports that a small tree decorated with \\"apples, nuts, dates, pretzels and paper flowers\\" was erected in the guild-house for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected the dainties on Christmas Day.[27] In 1584, the pastor and chronicler Balthasar Russow in his Chronica der Provinz Lyfflandt (1584) wrote of an established tradition of setting up a decorated spruce at the market square, where the young men \\"went with a flock of maidens and women, first sang and danced there and then set the tree aflame\\".\\r\\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, such trees are seen in the houses of upper-class Protestant families as a counterpart to the Catholic Christmas cribs. This transition from the guild hall to the bourgeois family homes in the Protestant parts of Germany ultimately gives rise to the modern tradition as it developed in the 18th and 19th centuries.\\r\\nBy the early 18th century, the custom had become common in towns of the upper Rhineland, but it had not yet spread to rural areas. Wax candles, expensive items at the time, are found in attestations from the late 18th century.\\r\\nAlong the lower Rhine, an area of Roman Catholic majority, the Christmas tree was largely regarded as a Protestant custom. As a result, it remained confined to the upper Rhineland for a relatively long period of time. The custom did eventually gain wider acceptance beginning around 1815 by way of Prussian officials who emigrated there following the Congress of Vienna.\\r\\nIn the 19th century, the Christmas tree was taken to be an expression of German culture and of Gemtlichkeit, especially among emigrants overseas.[28]\\r\\nA decisive factor in winning general popularity was the German army's decision to place Christmas trees in its barracks and military hospitals during the Franco-Prussian War. Only at the start of the 20th century did Christmas trees appear inside churches, this time in a new brightly lit form.[29]\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, the custom became popular among the nobility and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg introduced the Christmas tree to Vienna in 1816, and the custom spread across Austria in the following years. In France, the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the duchesse d'Orlans. In Denmark a Danish newspaper claims that the first attested Christmas tree was lit in 1808 by countess Wilhemine of Holsteinborg. It was the aging countess who told the story of the first Danish Christmas tree to the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen in 1865. He had published a fairy-tale called The Fir-Tree in 1844, recounting the fate of a fir-tree being used as a Christmas tree.[30]\\r\\nAlthough the tradition of decorating the home with evergreens was long established,[32] the custom of decorating an entire small tree was unknown in Britain until some two centuries ago. At the time of the personal union with Hanover, George III's German-born wife, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, introduced a Christmas tree at a party she gave for children in 1800.[33] The custom did not at first spread much beyond the royal family.[34] Queen Victoria as a child was familiar with it and a tree was placed in her room every Christmas. In her journal for Christmas Eve 1832, the delighted 13-year-old princess wrote:[35]\\r\\nAfter dinner... we then went into the drawing-room near the dining-room... There were two large round tables on which were placed two trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the presents being placed round the trees...\\r\\nAfter Victoria's marriage to her German cousin Prince Albert, by 1841 the custom became even more widespread[36] as wealthier middle-class families followed the fashion. In 1842 a newspaper advert for Christmas trees makes clear their smart cachet, German origins and association with children and gift-giving.[37] An illustrated book, The Christmas Tree, describing their use and origins in detail, was on sale in December 1844.[38] On 2 January 1846 Elizabeth Fielding (ne Fox Strangways) wrote from Laycock Abbey to William Henry Fox-Talbot: \\"Constance is extremely busy preparing the Bohemian Xmas Tree. It is made from Caroline's[39] description of those she saw in Germany\\".[40] In 1847 Prince Albert wrote: \\"I must now seek in the children an echo of what Ernest [his brother] and I were in the old time, of what we felt and thought; and their delight in the Christmas-trees is not less than ours used to be\\".[41] A boost to the trend was given in 1848[42] when The Illustrated London News,[43] in a report picked up by other papers,[44] described the trees in Windsor Castle in detail and showed the main tree, surrounded by the royal family, on its cover. In fewer than ten years their use in better-off homes was widespread. By 1856 a northern provincial newspaper contained an advert alluding casually to them,[45] as well as reporting the accidental death of a woman whose dress caught fire as she lit the tapers on a Christmas tree.[46] They had not yet spread down the social scale though, as a report from Berlin in 1858 contrasts the situation there where \\"Every family has its own\\" with that of Britain, where Christmas trees were still the preserve of the wealthy or the \\"romantic\\".[47]\\r\\nTheir use at public entertainments, charity bazaars and in hospitals made them increasingly familiar however, and in 1906 a charity was set up specifically to ensure even poor children in London slums 'who had never seen a Christmas tree' would enjoy one that year.[48] Anti-German sentiment after World War I briefly reduced their popularity[49] but the effect was short-lived[50] and by the mid-1920s the use of Christmas trees had spread to all classes.[51] In 1933 a restriction on the importation of foreign trees led to the \\"rapid growth of a new industry\\" as the growing of Christmas trees within Britain became commercially viable due to the size of demand.[52] By 2013 the number of trees grown in Britain for the Christmas market was approximately 8 million[53] and their display in homes, shops and public spaces a normal part of the Christmas season.\\r\\nThe tradition was introduced to North America in the winter of 1781 by Hessian soldiers stationed in the Province of Qubec (1763ÿ1791) to garrison the colony against American attack. General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel and his wife, the Baroness von Riedesel, held a Christmas party for the officers at Sorel, delighting their guests with a fir tree decorated with candles and fruits.[54]\\r\\nThe Christmas tree became very common in the United States in the early nineteenth century. The first image of a Christmas tree was published in 1836 as the frontispiece to The Stranger's Gift by Hermann Bokum. The first mention of the Christmas tree in American literature was in a story in the 1836 edition of The Token and Atlantic Souvenir, titled \\"New Year's Day,\\" by Catherine Maria Sedgwick, where she tells the story of a German maid decorating her mistress's tree. Also, a woodcut of the British Royal family with their Christmas tree at Windsor Castle, initially published in The Illustrated London News December 1848, was copied in the United States at Christmas 1850, in Godey's Lady's Book. Godey's copied it exactly, except for the removal of the Queen's tiara and Prince Albert's moustache, to remake the engraving into an American scene.[55] The republished Godey's image became the first widely circulated picture of a decorated evergreen Christmas tree in America. Art historian Karal Ann Marling called Prince Albert and Queen Victoria, shorn of their royal trappings, \\"the first influential American Christmas tree\\".[56] Folk-culture historian Alfred Lewis Shoemaker states, \\"In all of America there was no more important medium in spreading the Christmas tree in the decade 1850ÿ60 than Godey's Lady's Book\\". The image was reprinted in 1860, and by the 1870s, putting up a Christmas tree had become even more common in America.[55]\\r\\nSeveral cities in the United States with German connections lay claim to that country's first Christmas tree: Windsor Locks, Connecticut, claims that a Hessian soldier put up a Christmas tree in 1777 while imprisoned at the Noden-Reed House,[57] while the \\"First Christmas Tree in America\\" is also claimed by Easton, Pennsylvania, where German settlers purportedly erected a Christmas tree in 1816. In his diary, Matthew Zahm of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, recorded the use of a Christmas tree in 1821, leading Lancaster to also lay claim to the first Christmas tree in America.[58] Other accounts credit Charles Follen, a German immigrant to Boston, for being the first to introduce to America the custom of decorating a Christmas tree.[59] August Imgard, a German immigrant living in Wooster, Ohio, is said to be the first to popularize the practice of decorating a tree with candy canes.[citation needed] In 1847, Imgard cut a blue spruce tree from a woods outside town, had the Wooster village tinsmith construct a star, and placed the tree in his house, decorating it with paper ornaments, gilded nuts and Kuchen.[60] German immigrant Charles Minnegerode accepted a position as a professor of humanities at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1842, where he taught Latin and Greek. Entering into the social life of the Virginia Tidewater, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor St. George Tucker, thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.[61] An 1853 article on Christmas customs in Pennsylvania defines them as mostly \\"German in origin\\", including the Christmas tree, which is \\"planted in a flower pot filled with earth, and its branches are covered with presents, chiefly of confectionary, for the younger members of the family.\\" The article distinguishes between customs in different states however, claiming that in New England generally \\"Christmas is not much celebrated\\", whereas in Pennsylvania and New York it is.[62]\\r\\nWhen Edward H. Johnson was vice president of the Edison Electric Light Company, a predecessor of Con Edison, he created the first known electrically illuminated Christmas tree at his home in New York City in 1882. Johnson became the \\"Father of Electric Christmas Tree Lights\\".[63]\\r\\nThe lyrics sung in the United States to the German tune O Tannenbaum begin \\"O Christmas tree...\\", giving rise to the mistaken idea that the German word Tannenbaum (fir tree) means \\"Christmas tree\\", the German word for which is instead Weihnachtsbaum.\\r\\nThe Christmas tree by Winslow Homer, 1858\\r\\nChristmas in the Netherlands, c. 1899\\r\\nIllustration for Harper's Bazaar, published 1 January 1870.\\r\\nChristmas tree depicted as Christmas card by Prang & Co.

It became a fully secular icon of the New Year holiday, for example, the crowning star was regarded not as a symbol of Bethlehem Star, but as the Red star. Decorations, such as figurines of airplanes, bicycles, space rockets, cosmonauts, and characters of Russian fairy tales, were produced. This tradition persists after the fall of the USSR, with the New Year holiday outweighing the Christmas (7 January) for a wide majority of Russian people.[65]\\r\\nThe TV special A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) was influential on the pop culture surrounding the Christmas tree. Aluminum Christmas trees were popular during the early 1960s in the US. They were satirized in the Charlie Brown show and came to be seen as symbolizing the commercialization of Christmas. The term Charlie Brown Christmas tree, describing any poor-looking or malformed little tree, also derives from the 1965 TV special, based on the appearance of Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.[66]\\r\\nChristmas tree with presents\\r\\nChristmas Tree in the cozy room at the Wisconsin Governor's mansion.\\r\\nChristmas tea with Christmas Tree at an espresso shop in Eugene, Oregon\\r\\nA Soviet-era (1960s) New Year tree decoration depicting a cosmonaut\\r\\nChristmas Trees in church\\r\\nAn aluminum Christmas tree\\r\\nSince the early 20th century, it has become common in many cities, towns, and department stores to put up public Christmas trees outdoors, such as the Macy's Great Tree in Atlanta (since 1948), the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree in New York City, and the large Christmas tree at Victoria Square in Adelaide. The use of fire retardant allows many indoor public areas to place real trees and be compliant with code. Licensed applicants of fire retardant solution spray the tree, tag the tree, and provide a certificate for inspection. Real trees are popular with high end visual merchandising displays around the world. Leading global retailers such as Apple often place real trees in their window displays. In 2009, Apple placed two Fraser fir trees in every one of its retail establishments.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe United States' National Christmas Tree has been lit each year since 1923 on the South Lawn of the White House. Today,[clarification needed] the lighting of the National Christmas Tree is part of what has become a major holiday event at the White House. President Jimmy Carter lit only the crowning star atop the tree in 1979 in honor of the Americans being held hostage in Iran.[67] The same was true in 1980, except that the tree was fully lit for 417 seconds, one second for each day the hostages had been in captivity.[67]\\r\\nDuring most of the 1970s and 1980s, the largest decorated Christmas tree in the world was put up every year on the property of the National Enquirer in Lantana, Florida. This tradition grew into one of the most spectacular and celebrated events in the history of southern Florida, but was discontinued on the death of the paper's founder in the late 1980s.[68]\\r\\nIn some cities, a charity event called the Festival of Trees is organized, in which multiple trees are decorated and displayed.\\r\\nThe giving of Christmas trees has also often been associated with the end of hostilities. After the signing of the Armistice in 1918 the city of Manchester sent a tree, and S500 to buy chocolate and cakes, for the children of the much-bombarded town of Lille in northern France.[69] In some cases the trees represent special commemorative gifts, such as in Trafalgar Square in London, where the City of Oslo, Norway presents a tree to the people of London as a token of appreciation for the British support of Norwegian resistance during the Second World War; in Boston, where the tree is a gift from the province of Nova Scotia, in thanks for rapid deployment of supplies and rescuers to the 1917 ammunition ship explosion that leveled the city of Halifax; and in Newcastle upon Tyne, where the main civic Christmas tree is an annual gift from the city of Bergen, in thanks for the part played by soldiers from Newcastle in liberating Bergen from Nazi occupation.[70] Norway also annually gifts a Christmas tree to Washington, D.C. as a symbol of friendship between Norway and the US and as an expression of gratitude from Norway for the help received from the US during World War II.[71]\\r\\nChristmas tree in Milan, Italy, 2008\\r\\nChristmas tree in Vatican City, 2007\\r\\nChristmas tree in Salerno old town, Italy, 2008.\\r\\nTrafalgar Square Christmas tree\\r\\nRockefeller Center Christmas Tree\\r\\nChristmas tree on the R?merberg in Frankfurt (2008)\\r\\nin Lisbon (2005), at 75?metres (246?feet) the tallest Christmas tree in Europe.\\r\\nBoston's Christmas Tree.\\r\\nAn rbol navide?o luminoso in Madrid (2011)\\r\\nChristmas tree in Warsaw\\r\\nChristmas tree in South Coast Plaza, California\\r\\nChristmas tree in Stockholm at NK shopping mall\\r\\nChristmas trees in Ocean Terminal, Harbour City, Hong Kong\\r\\n\\r\\nA \\"Chrismon tree\\" is a Christmas tree decorated with explicitly Christian symbols in white and gold.[72][73] First introduced by North American Lutherans in 1957,[74] the practice has rapidly spread to other Christian denominations,[75] including Anglicans,[76] Catholics,[77] Methodists,[78] and the Reformed.[79]\\r\\n\\"Chrismon\\" (plural \\"Chrismons\\") was adopted for the type of Christmas decoration and explained as a portmanteau of \\"Christ-monogram\\" (a Christogram).[80][81]\\r\\nBoth setting up and taking down a Christmas tree are associated with specific dates. Traditionally, Christmas trees were not brought in and decorated until Christmas Eve (24 December)[citation needed] or, in the traditions celebrating Christmas Eve rather than the first day of Christmas, 23 December, and then removed the day after Twelfth Night (5 January); to have a tree up before or after these dates was even considered bad luck,[citation needed] and that to avoid bad luck from affecting the house's residents, the tree must be left up until after the following Twelfth Night passes.\\r\\nIn many areas, it has become customary to set up one's Christmas tree at the beginning of the Advent season.[82] Some families in the U.S. and Canada will put up a Christmas tree a week prior to American Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday of November), and Christmas decorations can show up even earlier in retail stores, often the day after Halloween (31 October). In Canada many families wait until after Remembrance Day, as to show respect to fallen soldiers. Some households do not put up the tree until the second week of December, and leave it up until 6 January (Epiphany). In Germany, traditionally the tree is put up on 24 December and taken down on 7 January, though many start one or two weeks earlier, and in Roman Catholic homes the tree may be kept until February 2 (Candlemas).[why?][citation needed]\\r\\nIn Italy, Ireland and Argentina, along with many countries in Latin America, the Christmas tree is put up on 8 December (Immaculate Conception day) and left up until 6 January. In Australia, the Christmas tree is usually put up on 1 December, which occurs about a 2 weeks before the school summer holidays (except for South Australia, where most people put up their tree after in late November following the completion of the Adelaide Christmas Pageant, a time frame that has started to filter into other states as the official time Christmas decorations and in store Santa Claus start to appear) and is left up until it is taken down.[citation needed] Some traditions suggest that Christmas trees may be kept up until no later than 2 February, the feast of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple (Candlemas), when the Christmas season effectively closes.[83] Superstitions say that it is a bad sign if Christmas greenery is not removed by Candlemas Eve.[84]\\r\\nChristmas ornaments are decorations (usually made of glass, metal, wood, or ceramics) that are used to decorate a Christmas tree. The first decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes and pastries in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers. Glass baubles were first made in Lauscha, Germany, and also garlands of glass beads and tin figures that could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations grew into the production of glass figures made by highly skilled artisans with clay molds.\\r\\nTinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used to decorate a Christmas tree. Silvered saran-based tinsel was introduced later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments were a specialty of the glass factories in the Thuringian Forest, especially in Lauscha in the late 19th century, and have since become a large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Baubles are another common decoration, consisting of small hollow glass or plastic spheres coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, with a further coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration. Lighting with electric lights (Christmas lights or, in the United Kingdom, fairy lights) is commonly done. A tree-topper, sometimes an angel but more frequently a star, completes the decoration.\\r\\nIn the late 1800s, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance of a snow-laden tree. In the 1940s and 1950s, popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s, flocking was very popular on the West Coast of the United States. There were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners. In the 1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white flocking to simulate snow.\\r\\nA transparent Christmas bauble\\r\\nA golden bauble decorating a Christmas tree\\r\\nChristmas baubles\\r\\nA snowman-shaped decoration painted as a baseball\\r\\nA toy bear Christmas decoration.\\r\\nFaberg egg as a Christmas decoration.\\r\\nChristmas decorations\\r\\nRed ornamented Christmas bauble\\r\\nChristmas baubles\\r\\nEach year, 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America, and 50 to 60 million are produced in Europe. In 1998, there were about 15,000 growers in America (a third of them \\"choose and cut\\" farms). In that same year, it was estimated that Americans spent $1.5 billion on Christmas trees.[85] By 2016 that had climbed to $2.04 billion for natural trees and a further $1.86 billion for artificial trees. In Europe, 75 million trees worth ?2.4 billion ($3.2 billion) are harvested annually.[86]\\r\\nThe most commonly used species are fir (Abies), which have the benefit of not shedding their needles when they dry out, as well as retaining good foliage color and scent; but species in other genera are also used.\\r\\nIn northern Europe most commonly used are:\\r\\nIn North America, Central America and South America most commonly used are:\\r\\nSeveral other species are used to a lesser extent. Less-traditional conifers are sometimes used, such as giant sequoia, Leyland cypress, Monterey cypress and eastern juniper. Various types of spruce tree are also used for Christmas trees (including the blue spruce and, less commonly, the white spruce); but spruces begin to lose their needles rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making decorating uncomfortable. Virginia pine is still available on some tree farms in the southeastern United States; however, its winter color is faded. The long-needled eastern white pine is also used there, though it is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island pine is sometimes used, particularly in Oceania, and in Australia, some species of the genera Casuarina and Allocasuarina are also occasionally used as Christmas trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the Monterey pine. Adenanthos sericeus or Albany woolly bush is commonly sold in southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. Hemlock species are generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and ornaments.\\r\\nSome trees, frequently referred to as \\"living Christmas trees\\", are sold live with roots and soil, often from a plant nursery, to be stored at nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often decorated) for years or decades. Others are produced in a container and sometimes as topiary for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly, the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree out of its natural winter dormancy, leaving it little protection when put back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the survival rate of these trees is low.[87] However, when done properly, replanting provides higher survival rates.[88]\\r\\nEuropean tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often wild-harvested on public lands)[89] there is a preference for close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang decorations.\\r\\nIn the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but now almost all are commercially grown on tree farms. Almost all Christmas trees in the United States are grown on Christmas tree farms where they are cut after about ten years of growth and new trees planted. According to the United States Department of Agriculture's agriculture census for 2007, 21,537 farms were producing conifers for the cut Christmas tree market in America, 5,717.09 square kilometres (1,412,724 acres) were planted in Christmas trees.[90]\\r\\nThe life cycle of a Christmas tree from the seed to a 2-metre (7?ft) tree takes, depending on species and treatment in cultivation, between 8 and 12 years. First, the seed is extracted from cones harvested from older trees. These seeds are then usually grown in nurseries and then sold to Christmas tree farms at an age of 3ÿ4 years. The remaining development of the tree greatly depends on the climate, soil quality, as well as the cultivation and how the trees are tended by the Christmas tree farmer.[91]\\r\\nThe first artificial Christmas trees were developed in Germany during the 19th century,[92][93] though earlier examples exist.[94] These \\"trees\\" were made using goose feathers that were dyed green.,[92] as one response by Germans to continued deforestation.[93] Feather Christmas trees ranged widely in size, from a small 2-inch (51?mm) tree to a large 98-inch (2,500?mm) tree sold in department stores during the 1920s.[95] Often, the tree branches were tipped with artificial red berries which acted as candle holders.[96]\\r\\nOver the years, other styles of artificial Christmas trees have evolved and become popular. In 1930, the U.S.-based Addis Brush Company created the first artificial Christmas tree made from brush bristles.[97] Another type of artificial tree is the aluminum Christmas tree,[93] first manufactured in Chicago in 1958,[98] and later in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, where the majority of the trees were produced.[99] Most modern artificial Christmas trees are made from plastic recycled from used packaging materials, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC).[93] Approximately 10% of artificial Christmas trees are using virgin suspension PVC resin; despite being plastic most artificial trees are not recyclable or biodegradable.[100]\\r\\nOther trends have developed in the early 2000s as well. Optical fiber Christmas trees come in two major varieties; one resembles a traditional Christmas tree.[101] One Dallas-based company offers \\"holographic mylar\\" trees in many hues.[94] Tree-shaped objects made from such materials as cardboard,[102] glass,[103] ceramic or other materials can be found in use as tabletop decorations. Upside-down artificial Christmas trees became popular for a short time and were originally introduced as a marketing gimmick; they allowed consumers to get closer to ornaments for sale in retail stores and opened up floor space for more products.[104] Artificial trees became increasingly popular during the late 20th century.[93] Users of artificial Christmas trees assert that they are more convenient, and, because they are reusable, much cheaper than their natural alternative.[93] They are also considered much safer[105] as natural trees can be a significant fire hazard. Between 2001 and 2007 artificial Christmas tree sales in the U.S. jumped from 7.3 million to 17.4 million.[106] Currently it is estimated that around 58% of Christmas trees used in the United States are artificial while numbers in the United Kingdom are indicated to be around 66%.[107]\\r\\nA tree with fibre optic lights\\r\\nChristmas tree and presents Athens, Greece\\r\\nWhite Christmas tree\\r\\nSpanish artificial Christmas tree\\r\\nA chrismon tree (St. Alban's Anglican Cathedral, Oviedo, Florida)\\r\\nAn artificial Aluminum Christmas tree\\r\\nArtificial tree\\r\\nThe debate about the environmental impact of artificial trees is ongoing. Generally, natural tree growers contend that artificial trees are more environmentally harmful than their natural counterparts.[106] However, trade groups such as the American Christmas Tree Association, continue to refute that artificial trees are more harmful to the environment, and maintain that the PVC used in Christmas trees has excellent recyclable properties.[108]\\r\\nLive trees are typically grown as a crop and replanted in rotation after cutting, often providing suitable habitat for wildlife.[citation needed] Alternately, live trees can be donated to livestock farmers of such animals like goats who find that such trees uncontaminated by chemical additives are excellent fodder.[109] In some cases management of Christmas tree crops can result in poor habitat since it sometimes involves heavy input of pesticides.[110] Concerns have been raised about people cutting down old and rare conifers, such as the Keteleeria evelyniana and Abies fraseri , for Christmas trees.\\r\\nReal or cut trees are used only for a short time, but can be recycled and used as mulch, wildlife habitat, or used to prevent erosion.[111][112][113] Real trees are carbon-neutral, they emit no more carbon dioxide by being cut down and disposed of than they absorb while growing.[114] However, emissions can occur from farming activities and transportation. An independent life-cycle assessment study, conducted by a firm of experts in sustainable development, states that a natural tree will generate 3.1?kg (6.8?lb) of greenhouse gases every year (based on purchasing 5?km (3.1 miles) from home) whereas the artificial tree will produce 48.3?kg (106?lb) over its lifetime.[115] Some people use living Christmas or potted trees for several seasons, providing a longer life cycle for each tree. Living Christmas trees can be purchased or rented from local market growers. Rentals are picked up after the holidays, while purchased trees can be planted by the owner after use or donated to local tree adoption or urban reforestation services.[116]\\r\\nMost artificial trees are made of recycled PVC rigid sheets using tin stabilizer in the recent years. In the past, lead was often used as a stabilizer in PVC, but is now banned by Chinese laws.[citation needed] The use of lead stabilizer in Chinese imported trees has been an issue of concern among politicians and scientists over recent years. A 2004 study found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from lead contamination, there do exist \\"worst-case scenarios\\" where major health risks to young children exist.[117] A 2008 United States Environmental Protection Agency report found that as the PVC in artificial Christmas trees aged it began to degrade.[118] The report determined that of the 50 million artificial trees in the United States approximately 20 million were 9 or more years old, the point where dangerous lead contamination levels are reached.[118] A professional study on the life-cycle assessment of both real and artificial Christmas trees revealed that one must use an artificial Christmas tree at least 20 years to leave an environmental footprint as small as the natural Christmas tree.[115]\\r\\nThe Christmas tree was first used by German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strassburg in 1539, under the leadership of the Protestant Reformer, Martin Bucer.[119][120] In the United States, these \\"German Lutherans brought the decorated Christmas tree with them; the Moravians put lighted candles on those trees.\\"[121][122] When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem, a fact recorded by The School Journal in 1897.[5][123] Professor David Albert Jones of Oxford University writes that in the 19th century, it became popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of Jesus.[6]\\r\\nUnder the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrationsalong with other religious holidayswere prohibited as a result of the Soviet anti-religious campaign.[124][125][126] The League of Militant Atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, among them being the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays, including Easter; the League established an anti-religious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement.[127] With the Christmas tree being prohibited in accordance with Soviet anti-religious legislation, people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year's trees.[126][128] In 1935 the tree was brought back as New Year tree and became a secular, not a religious holiday.\\r\\nPope John Paul II introduced the Christmas tree custom to the Vatican in 1982. Although at first disapproved of by some as out of place at the centre of the Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican Christmas Tree has become an integral part of the Vatican Christmas celebrations,[129] and in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI spoke of it as part of the normal Christmas decorations in Catholic homes.[130] In 2004, Pope John Paul called the Christmas tree a symbol of Christ. This very ancient custom, he said, exalts the value of life, as in winter what is evergreen becomes a sign of undying life, and it reminds Christians of the \\"tree of life\\" of Genesis 2:9, an image of Christ, the supreme gift of God to humanity.[131] In the previous year he said: \\"Beside the crib, the Christmas tree, with its twinkling lights, reminds us that with the birth of Jesus the tree of life has blossomed anew in the desert of humanity. The crib and the tree: precious symbols, which hand down in time the true meaning of Christmas.\\"[132] The Catholic Church's official Book of Blessings has a service for the blessing of the Christmas tree in a home.[133] Likewise the Protestant Episcopal Church in The Anglican Family Prayer Book, which has the imprimatur of The Rt. Rev. Catherine S. Roskam of the Anglican Communion, has long had a ritual titled Blessing of a Christmas Tree, as well as Blessing of a Crche, for use in the church and the home.[134]\\r\\nIn 2005, the city of Boston renamed the spruce tree used to decorate the Boston Common a \\"Holiday Tree\\" rather than a \\"Christmas Tree\\".[135] The name change drew a poor response from the public and it was reversed after the city was threatened with several lawsuits.[136]\\r\\nChrismon trees are a variety developed in 1957 by a Lutheran laywoman in Virginia, as a specifically religious version appropriate for a church's Christmas celebrations, although most Christian churches continue to display the traditional Christmas tree in their sanctuaries during Christmastide.[137]","input":"When were christmas trees first introduced to england?"},{"output":"May 1999","context":"","input":"When did jennifer lopez released her first single?"},{"output":"Pevans East Africa","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSportPesa is a sports betting platform with operations in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, the Isle of Man and the UK, where it operates in conjunction with TGP Europe.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSportPesa, in Kenya, is owned and operated by Pevans East Africa, a company with shareholders from mostly Kenya, Bulgaria, and the United States.[3] In Italy Sportpesa is jointly owned with RCS Media, which is the largest media company in Italy[4].\\r\\n\\r\\nSportPesa has invested in the development of the local sports leagues and tournaments in Kenya and Tanzania.[5] [6][7]. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe company has signed agreements to build local and international partnerships in soccer, rugby, boxing, motorsport,[8] athletics, golf and kabaddi.

E. B. Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter. It was named for the \\"mighty current\\" of change the group wanted to effect and Niagara Falls, near Fort Erie, Ontario, was where the first meeting took place in July 1905. The Niagara Movement was a call for opposition to racial segregation and disenfranchisement, and it was opposed to policies of accommodation and conciliation promoted by African-American leaders such as Booker T. Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Reconstruction Era that followed the American Civil War, African Americans had an unprecedented level of civil freedom and civic participation, especially in the Southern United States.  With the end of Reconstruction in the 1870s this began to change. By the 1890s many of the Southern states introduced laws that significantly restricted the political and civil rights of African Americans.[1]  All of them passed laws restricting voting rights, or making them significantly more difficult to exercise, and also passed laws requiring racially segregated facilities.  These policies became entrenched when the United States Supreme Court in 1896 ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that law requiring \\"separate but equal\\" facilities were constitutional.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most prominent African-American spokesman during the 1890s was Booker T. Washington, leader of Alabama's Tuskegee Institute.  Washington outlined a response to these policies in an 1895 speech in Atlanta, Georgia that became known as the Atlanta Compromise.  The basic thrust of his approach was that Southern African-Americans should not agitate for political rights (such as the right to vote and equal treatment under the law) as long as they were provided economic opportunities and basic rights of due process.[2]  Washington also politically dominated the National Afro-American Council, the first nationwide African-American civil rights organization.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the turn of the 20th century activists within the African-American community began demanding a more active opposition to racist government policies than the type advocated by Washington.  Early opponents of Washington's \\"accommodationist\\" policies included W. E. B. Du Bois, then a professor at Atlanta University, and William Monroe Trotter, a Boston activist who in 1901 founded the Boston Guardian newspaper as a platform for radical activism.[4][5]  In 1902 and 1903 groups of activists sought to gain a larger voice in the debate at the conventions of the National Afro-American Council, but were procedurally marginalized because the conventions were dominated by Washington supporters (also known as Bookerites).[6]  Trotter in July 1903 orchestrated a confrontation with Washington in Boston, a stronghold of activism, that resulted in a minor melee and the arrest of Trotter and others; the event garnered national headlines.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1904 Washington, with funding assistance from Andrew Carnegie, organized a meeting in New York to unite African American and civil rights spokesmen.  Trotter was not invited, but Du Bois and a few other activists were.  Du Bois was then sympathetic to the activist cause and suspicious of Washington's motives, and noted that the number of activists invited was small relative to the number of Bookerites.  The meeting laid the foundation for a committee that included both Washington and Du Bois, but quickly fractured, and dissolved when Du Bois resigned in July 1905.[8]  By this time both Du Bois and Trotter recognized the need for a well-organized anti-Washington activist group.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to Du Bois and Trotter, Fredrick L. McGhee of St. Paul, Minnesota and Charles Edwin Bentley of Chicago had also come to recognize the need for a nationwide activist group.[9]  These four men organized a conference to be held in the Buffalo, New York area in the summer of 1905, inviting 59 carefully selected anti-Bookerites to attend.  In July 1905 28 people met at the Erie Beach Hotel[10] in Fort Erie, Ontario, opposite Buffalo. Differing explanations exist for why the group met in southern Ontario and not Buffalo. A commonly given reason, which has not been substantiated by primary sources, is that they had originally planned to meet in Buffalo, but were refused accommodation.[11][12]  Du Bois' writings of the time, however, show that his original plan was to find a quiet, out of the way location for the event, and that the Erie Beach Hotel satisfied his requirements.  Researcher Cynthia Van Ness has further located contemporary evidence of Buffalo hotels complying with a statewide anti-discrimination law passed in 1895.[13][14]  Bookerites had been alerted to the planned conference, but one who traveled to Buffalo to investigate the conference found no activity there.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organization founded at this meeting had Du Bois as its general secretary, Cincinnati lawyer George Jackson as treasurer, and a number of committees to oversee progress on the organization's goals.  State chapters would advance local agendas and disseminate information about the organization and its goals.[15] Its name was chosen to reflect the site of its first meeting and to be representative of a \\"mighty current\\" of change its leaders sought to bring about.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attendees of the inaugural meeting drafted a \\"Declaration of Principles\\", which was primarily the work of Du Bois and Trotter.[17] The philosophies of the group were in direct contrast to more conciliatory philosophies of Booker T. Washington that proposed patience over militancy.[18]  The declaration clearly outlined the group's philosophy and its demands; politically, socially and economically. It began by first describing the progress that the \\"Negro-Americans\\" had made \\"particularly the increase of intelligence, the buy-in of property, the checking of crime, the uplift in home life, the advance in literature and art, and the demonstration of constructive and executive ability in the conduct of great religious, economic and educational institutions\\".[17]  It called for blacks to be granted manhood suffrage. It called for equal treatment for all American citizens alike. Very specifically, it demanded equal economic opportunities, in the rural districts of the South, which amounted for many blacks trapped in indentured servitude to  whites and resulted in \\"virtual slavery\\", or in terms of all of south so that they had the ability to \\"earn a decent living\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the subject of education the authors declared that not only should it be made free, it should be made compulsory.  Higher education, they declared, should be governed independently of class or race, and they demanded action to be taken to improve \\"high school facilities\\".  This they emphasized: \\"either the United States will destroy ignorance, or ignorance will destroy the United States\\".[19]  The document also demanded that judges be selected independently of their race, and that the criminals, white or black, should be given equal punishments for their respective crimes.  In his address to the nation, W. E. B. Du Bois stated, \\"We are not more lawless than the white race; we [are] more often arrested, convicted and mobbed.  We want justice, even for criminals and outlaws.\\"  He called for the outright abolition of the convict lease system.  In this system, during times when there wasn't enough space in the prisons, convicts were leased out to work as cheap laborers for \\"railway contractors, mining companies and those who farm large plantations\\".[20]  Urging others to return to the faith of \\"our fathers\\", it appealed for everyone to be considered equal and free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe declaration also targeted the treatment blacks received from labor unions, often oppressed and not fully protected by their employers nor granted a permanent employment. It validated the already announced affirmation that such protest against outright injustice would not cease until such discrimination did. Secondly, Du Bois and Trotter stated the irrationality of discriminating based on one's \\"physical peculiarities\\" whether it be place of birth or color of skin. Perhaps one's ignorance, or immorality, poverty or even diseases are legitimate excuses, but not the matters that we have no control over.  Near its end, the document goes on to condemn the Jim Crow laws, the rejection of blacks by the Navy and by the military academies, the non-enforcement of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments protecting the rights of blacks, and the \\"unchristian\\" behaviors of churches that segregate and show prejudice to their black brothers. The Declaration of Principles of 1905 ended by thanking those who \\"stand for equality\\" and the advancement of this cause.[17][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBooker T. Washington and his supporters moved to oppose the growth of the organization.  Washington, Thomas Fortune, and Charles Anderson met after learning of the Movement's formation, and agreed to suppress news of it in the black press.[22]  They acquired supporters in Archibald Grimk and Kelly Miller, two moderates who had been friendly with Trotter, but had not been invited by Du Bois to the convention (Grimk was hired by Fortune's New York Age).  The Age editorialized that the Movement was little more than an attempt to tear down the house that Washington had labored to set up.[23]  A Boston supporter of Washington convinced the printer of Trotter's Guardian to withdraw his services, but Trotter managed to continue printing anyway.[24]  Prominent white activists, including Francis Jackson Garrison and Oswald Garrison Villard (sons of Trotter idol William Lloyd Garrison), refused to attend Trotter-organized commemorations of their father's birth centennial,[25] preferring instead a celebration organized by Bookerites.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite Washington's attempts to suppress the organization's message, Du Bois reported at the end of 1905 that a number of black publications had published accounts of its activities, and it received further publicity as a consequence of Bookerite press attacks against it.[27]  Washington's attacks extended to the Constitution League, a multi-racial civil rights group also opposed to Washington's policies, with whom the Movement made common cause.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the initial meeting, delegates returned to their home territories to establish local chapters.  By mid-September 1905, they had established chapters in 21 states and the organization had 170 members by year's end.[29]  Du Bois founded a magazine, the Moon, in an attempt to establish an official mouthpiece for the organization.  It failed due to a lack of funding after only a few months of publication.[30]  A second publication, The Horizon, was started in 1907 and survived until 1910.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movement's second meeting, the first to be held on U.S. soil, took place at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, the site of  abolitionist John Brown's 1859 raid. The three-day gathering, from August 15 to 18, 1906, took place at the campus of Storer College (now part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park).  Convention attendees discussed how to secure civil rights for African Americans, and the meeting was later described by Du Bois as \\"one of the greatest meetings that American Negroes ever held.\\" Attendees walked from Storer College to the nearby Murphy Family farm, relocation site of the historic fort where John Brown's quest to end slavery reached its bloody climax. Once there they removed their shoes and socks to honor the hallowed ground and participated in a ceremony of remembrance.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of the organization's chapters made substantive contributions to the advance of civil rights in 1906.  The Massachusetts chapter successfully lobbied against state legislation for the segregation of railroad cars, but was unable to stop the state from helping to fund the Jamestown Exposition, a commemoration of the founding of racially motivated Jamestown, Virginia, in which Virginia sought to limit black admission.  The Illinois chapter convinced Chicago theater critics to ignore a production of The Clansman.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the early months of 1906 friction began to develop between Du Bois and Trotter over the admission of women to the organization.  Du Bois supported the idea, and Trotter opposed it, but eventually relented, and the matter was smoothed over during the 1906 meeting.[34]  Their division became more significant when Trotter split with longtime supporter and Movement member Clement Morgan over Massachusetts politics and control of the local Movement chapter, with Du Bois siding with the latter.[35]  When the Movement met in Boston in 1907 Du Bois not only admitted Grimk and Miller to the organization, he reappointed Morgan to a leading position in the organization.[36]  Further attempts to heal the rift failed, and Trotter then resigned from the Movement.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1906 there were several proposals floated in the black press that the Movement be merged with other organizations.  None of these proposals got off the ground, with the only substance being a meeting between the Movement's Washington, DC chapter and members of the Bookerite National Afro-American Council.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Movement, in conjunction with the Constitution League (which took Du Bois on as a director), began organizing legal challenges to segregationist laws in early 1907.  For an organization with a limited budget, this was an expensive proposition: the single case they mounted challenging Virginia's railroad segregation law put the organization into debt.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nDu Bois had sought to return to Harpers Ferry for the 1907 annual meeting, but Storer College refused to grant them permission, claiming the  group's presence in 1906 had been followed by financial and political pressure from its supporters to distance itself from them.  The 1907 meeting was held in Boston, with conflicting attendance reports.  Du Bois claimed 800 attendees, while the Bookerite Washington Bee claimed only about 100 had attended.[39]  The convention published an \\"Address to the World\\" in which it called on African-Americans not to vote for Republican Party candidates in the 1908 presidential election, citing President Theodore Roosevelt's support for Jim Crow laws.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Monroe Trotter's departure after the 1907 meeting had a serious negative impact on the organization, as did disagreements about which party to support in the 1908 election.  Du Bois, with some reluctance, endorsed Democratic Party candidate William Jennings Bryan, but many African-Americans could not bring themselves to break from the Republicans, and William Howard Taft won the election, receiving significant African-American support.[41]  The 1908 annual meeting, held in Oberlin, Ohio, was a much smaller affair, and exposed disunity and apathy within the group at both local and national levels.[42]  Du Bois invited Mary White Ovington, a settlement worker and socialist he had met in 1904, to address the organization.  She was the only white woman to be so honored.[43]  By 1908 Washington and his supporters successfully made serious inroads with the press (both white and black), and the Oberlin meeting received almost no coverage.[44]  Believing the Movement to be \\"practically dead\\", Washington also prepared an obituary of the organization for the New York Age to publish.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1909 chapter activities continued to dwindle, membership dropped, and the annual meeting (held at Sea Isle City, New Jersey) was a small affair that again received no significant press.  It was to be the organization's last meeting.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of a major race riot in Springfield, Illinois in August 1908, a number of prominent white civil rights activists called for a major conference on race relations.  Held in New York in early 1909, the conference laid the foundation for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which was formally established in 1910.  In 1911, Du Bois (who was appointed the NAACP's director of publications) recommended that the remaining membership of the Niagara Movement support the NAACP's activities.[32]  William Monroe Trotter attended the 1909 conference, but did not join the NAACP; he instead led other small activist civil rights organizations and continued to publish the Guardian until his death in 1934.[46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Niagara Movement did not appear to be very popular with the majority of the African-American population, especially in the South.  Booker T. Washington, at the height of the Movement's activities in 1905 and 1906, spoke to large and approving crowds across much of the country.[48]  The 1906 Atlanta Race Riot hurt Washington's popularity, giving the Niagarans fuel for their attacks on him.[49]   However, given that Washington and the Niagarans agreed on strategy (opposition to Jim Crow laws and support of equal protection and civil rights) but disagreed on tactics, a reconciliation between the factions began after Washington died in 1915.[50]  The NAACP went on to become the leading African-American civil rights organization of the 20th century.","input":"What was the main goal of the niagara movement?"},{"output":"\\"It's All Over Now\\"","context":"","input":"What was the first hit for the rolling stones?"},{"output":"general government","context":"Federalism is the mixed or compound mode of government, combining a general government (the central or 'federal' government) with regional governments (provincial, state, cantonal, territorial or other sub-unit governments) in a single political system. Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism by the United States of America under the Constitution of 1787, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established.[1] It can thus be defined as a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status.[2]\\r\\nFederalism differs from confederalism, in which the general level of government is subordinate to the regional level, and from devolution within a unitary state, in which the regional level of government is subordinate to the general level.[3] It represents the central form in the pathway of regional integration or separation,[4] bounded on the less integrated side by confederalism and on the more integrated side by devolution within a unitary state.[5]\\r\\nLeading examples of the federation or federal state include the United States, Canada, Brazil, Germany, Switzerland, Argentina, Australia and India. Some also today characterize the European Union as the pioneering example of federalism in a multi-state setting, in a concept termed the federal union of states.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe terms 'federalism' and 'confederalism' both have a root in the Latin word foedus, meaning \\"treaty, pact or covenant.\\" Their common meaning until the late eighteenth century was a simple league or inter-governmental relationship among sovereign states based upon a treaty. They were therefore initially synonyms. It was in this sense that James Madison in Federalist 39 had referred to the new United States as 'neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both' (i.e. neither a single large unitary state nor a league/confederation among several small states, but a hybrid of the two).[7] In the course of the nineteenth century the meaning of federalism would come to shift, strengthening to refer uniquely to the novel compound political form, while the meaning of confederalism would remain at a league of states.[8] Thus, this article relates to the modern usage of the word 'federalism'.\\r\\nModern federalism is a system based upon democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments. The term federalist describes several political beliefs around the world depending on context.\\r\\nFederalism is sometimes viewed as in the context of international negotiation as \\"the best system for integrating diverse nations, ethnic groups, or combatant parties, all of whom may have cause to fear control by an overly powerful center.\\"[9] However, in some countries, those skeptical of federal prescriptions believe that increased regional autonomy is likely to lead to secession or dissolution of the nation.[9] In Syria, federalization proposals have failed in part because \\"Syrians fear that these borders could turn out to be the same as the ones that the fighting parties have currently carved out.\\"[9]\\r\\nFederations such as Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia collapsed as soon as it was possible to put the model to the test.[10]\\r\\nAccording to Daniel Ziblatt's Structuring the State, there are four competing theoretical explanations in the academic literature for the adoption of federal systems:\\r\\nIn Europe, \\"Federalist\\" is sometimes used to describe those who favor a common federal government, with distributed power at regional, national and supranational levels. Most European federalists want this development to continue within the European Union.[citation needed] European federalism originated in post-war Europe; one of the more important initiatives was Winston Churchill's speech in Zrich in 1946.[12]\\r\\nIn the United States, federalism originally referred to belief in a stronger central government. When the U.S. Constitution was being drafted, the Federalist Party supported a stronger central government, while \\"Anti-Federalists\\" wanted a weaker central government. This is very different from the modern usage of \\"federalism\\" in Europe and the United States. The distinction stems from the fact that \\"federalism\\" is situated in the middle of the political spectrum between a confederacy and a unitary state. The U.S. Constitution was written as a reaction to the Articles of Confederation, under which the United States was a loose confederation with a weak central government.\\r\\nIn contrast, Europe has a greater history of unitary states than North America, thus European \\"federalism\\" argues for a weaker central government, relative to a unitary state. The modern American usage of the word is much closer to the European sense. As the power of the Federal government has increased, some people have perceived a much more unitary state than they believe the Founding Fathers intended. Most people politically advocating \\"federalism\\" in the United States argue in favor of limiting the powers of the federal government, especially the judiciary (see Federalist Society, New Federalism).\\r\\nIn Canada, federalism typically implies opposition to sovereigntist movements (most commonly Quebec separatism).\\r\\nThe governments of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, India, and Mexico, among others, are also organized along federalist principles.\\r\\nFederalism may encompass as few as two or three internal divisions, as is the case in Belgium or Bosnia and Herzegovina. In general, two extremes of federalism can be distinguished: at one extreme, the strong federal state is almost completely unitary, with few powers reserved for local governments; while at the other extreme, the national government may be a federal state in name only, being a confederation in actuality.\\r\\nIn 1999, the Government of Canada established the Forum of Federations as an international network for exchange of best practices among federal and federalizing countries. Headquartered in Ottawa, the Forum of Federations partner governments include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and Switzerland.\\r\\nOn the 1st of January 1901 the nation-state of Australia officially came into existence as a federation. The Australian continent was colonised by the United Kingdom in 1788, which subsequently established six, eventually self-governing, colonies there. In the 1890s the governments of these colonies all held referendums on becoming a unified, self-governing \\"Commonwealth\\" within the British Empire. When all the colonies voted in favour of federation, the Federation of Australia commenced, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The model of Australian federalism adheres closely to the original model of the United States of America, although it does so through a parliamentary Westminster system rather than a presidential system.\\r\\nIn Brazil, the fall of the monarchy in 1889 by a military coup d'tat led to the rise of the presidential system, headed by Deodoro da Fonseca. Aided by well-known jurist Ruy Barbosa, Fonseca established federalism in Brazil by decree, but this system of government would be confirmed by every Brazilian constitution since 1891, although some of them would distort some of the federalist principles. The 1937 federal government had the authority to appoint State Governors (called interventors) at will, thus centralizing power in the hands of President Get~lio Vargas. Brazil also uses the Fonseca system to regulate interstate trade. Brazil is one of the biggest federal governments.\\r\\nThe Brazilian Constitution of 1988 introduced a new component to the ideas of federalism, including municipalities as federal entities. Brazilian municipalities are now invested with some of the traditional powers usually granted to states in federalism, and they are allowed to have a Constitution like the Constitution of Rio Grande do Sul State\\r\\nIn Canada the system of federalism is described by the division of powers between the federal parliament and the country's provincial governments. Under the Constitution Act (previously known as the British North America Act) of 1867, specific powers of legislation are allotted. Section 91 of the constitution gives rise to federal authority for legislation, whereas section 92 gives rise to provincial powers.\\r\\nFor matters not directly dealt with in the constitution, the federal government retains residual powers; however, conflict between the two levels of government, relating to which level has legislative jurisdiction over various matters, has been a longstanding and evolving issue. Areas of contest include legislation with respect to regulation of the economy, taxation, and natural resources.\\r\\nThe Government of India (referred to as the Union Government) was established by the Constitution of India, and is the governing authority of a federal union of 29 states and 7 union territories.\\r\\nThe government of India is based on a 3 tiered system, in which the Constitution of India delineates the subjects on which each tier of government has executive powers. The Constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government, the Union Government (also known as the Central Government), representing the Union of India, and the State governments. Later, a third tier was added in the form of Panchayats and Municipalities. In the current arrangement, The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution delimits the subjects of each level of governmental jurisdiction, dividing them into three lists:\\r\\nA distinguishing aspect of Indian federalism is that unlike many other forms of federalism, it is asymmetric.[13] Article 370 makes special provisions for the state of Jammu and Kashmir as per its Instrument of Accession. Article 371 makes special provisions for the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Goa, Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Sikkim as per their accession or state-hood deals. Also one more aspect of Indian federalism is system of President's Rule in which the central government (through its appointed Governor) takes control of state's administration for certain months when no party can form a government in the state or there is violent disturbance in the state.\\r\\nAlthough the Constitution does not say so, India is now a multilingual federation.[13] India has a multi-party system, with political allegiances frequently based on linguistic, regional and caste identities,[14] necessitating coalition politics, especially at the Union level.\\r\\nMalaysia is a federal constitutional monarchy.\\r\\nAlthough South Africa bears some elements of a federal system, such as the allocation of certain powers to provinces, it is nevertheless constitutionally and functionally a unitary state.[15]\\r\\nSeveral federal systems exist in Europe, such as in Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union.\\r\\nIn Britain, an Imperial Federation was once seen as (inter alia) a method of solving the Home Rule problem in Ireland; federalism has long been proposed[by whom?] as a solution to the \\"Irish Problem\\", and more lately, to the \\"West Lothian question\\".[16]\\r\\nDuring the French Revolution, especially in 1793, \\"federalism\\" had an entirely different meaning. It was a political movement to weaken the central government in Paris by devolving power to the provinces.[17][18]\\r\\nFollowing the end of World War II, several movements began advocating a European federation, such as the Union of European Federalists and the European Movement, founded in 1948. Those organizations exercised influence in the European unification process, but never in a decisive way.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlthough the drafts of both the Maastricht treaty and the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe mentioned federalism, the reference never made it to the text of the treaties adopted by consensus. The strongest advocates of European federalism have been Germany, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg while those historically most strongly opposed have been the United Kingdom, Denmark and France (with conservative heads of state and governments).[citation needed] Since the presidency of Fran?ois Mitterrand (1981-1995), the French authorities have adopted a much more pro-European Unification position, as they consider that a strong EU is presenting the best \\"insurance\\" against a unified Germany which might become too strong and thus a threat for its neighbours.\\r\\nThose uncomfortable using the F word in the EU context should feel free to refer to it as a quasi-federal or federal-like system. Nevertheless, for the purposes of the analysis here, the EU has the necessary attributes of a federal system. It is striking that while many scholars of the EU continue to resist analyzing it as a federation, most contemporary students of federalism view the EU as a federal system (See for instance, Bednar, Filippov et al., McKay, Kelemen, Defigueido and Weingast). (R. Daniel Kelemen)[19]\\r\\nGermany and the EU present the only examples of federalism in the world where members of the federal \\"upper houses\\" (the German Bundesrat (Federal Council) and the European Council) are neither elected nor appointed but comprise members or delegates of the governments of their constituents. The United States had a similar system until 1913, where prior to the 17th Amendment, Senators were delegates of the state elected by the state legislatures rather than the citizens.\\r\\nAlready the Holy Roman Empire, the Confederation of the Rhine, the German Confederation, the North German Confederation, the German Empire and the Weimar Republic were federal complexes of territories of different political structures. Modern Germany abandoned federalism only during Nazism (1933ÿ1945) and in the DDR (German Democratic Republic a.k.a. East Germany) from 1952 to 1990. Adolf Hitler viewed federalism as an obstacle to his goals. As he wrote in Mein Kampf, \\"National Socialism must claim the right to impose its principles on the whole German nation, without regard to what were hitherto the confines of federal states.\\"[page?needed]\\r\\nAccordingly, the idea of a strong, centralized government has very negative connotations in German politics, although the progressive political movements in Germany (Liberals, Social Democrats) were advocating at the time of the Second German Empire (1871-1918) to abolish (or to reshape) the majority of German federated states of that era, as they were considered to be mostly monarchist remnances of the feudal structures of the Middle Ages.[20]\\r\\nThe post-Imperial nature of Russian subdivision of government changed towards a generally autonomous model which began with the establishment of the USSR (of which Russia was governed as part). It was liberalized in the aftermath of the Soviet Union, with the reforms under Boris Yeltsin preserving much of the Soviet structure while applying increasingly liberal reforms to the governance of the constituent republics and subjects (while also coming into conflict with Chechen secessionist rebels during the Chechen War). Some of the reforms under Yeltsin were scaled back by Vladimir Putin.\\r\\nAll of Russia's subdivisional entities are known as subjects, with some smaller entities, such as the republics enjoying more autonomy than other subjects on account of having an extant presence of a culturally non-Russian ethnic minority or, in some cases, majority.\\r\\nCurrently, there are 85 federal subjects of Russia.\\r\\nThe UAE is a federal absolute monarchy of the six ruling families of the United Arab Emirates with Emir of each Emirate being an absolute monarch and the Emir of Abu Dhabi being also the President of the UAE.\\r\\nFederalism in the United States is the evolving relationship between state governments and the federal government of the United States. American government has evolved from a system of dual federalism to one of associative federalism. In \\"Federalist No. 46,\\" James Madison asserted that the states and national government \\"are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people, constituted with different powers.\\" Alexander Hamilton, writing in \\"Federalist No. 28,\\" suggested that both levels of government would exercise authority to the citizens' benefit: \\"If their [the peoples'] rights are invaded by either, they can make use of the other as the instrument of redress.\\" (1)\\r\\nBecause the states were preexisting political entities, the U.S. Constitution did not need to define or explain federalism in any one section but it often mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments and state officials in relation to the federal government. The federal government has certain express powers (also called enumerated powers) which are powers spelled out in the Constitution, including the right to levy taxes, declare war, and regulate interstate and foreign commerce. In addition, the Necessary and Proper Clause gives the federal government the implied power to pass any law \\"necessary and proper\\" for the execution of its express powers. Other powersthe reserved powersare reserved to the people or the states.[21] The power delegated to the federal government was significantly expanded by the Supreme Court decision in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), amendments to the Constitution following the Civil War, and by some later amendmentsas well as the overall claim of the Civil War, that the states were legally subject to the final dictates of the federal government.\\r\\nThe Federalist Party of the United States was opposed by the Democratic-Republicans, including powerful figures such as Thomas Jefferson. The Democratic-Republicans mainly believed that: the Legislature had too much power (mainly because of the Necessary and Proper Clause) and that they were unchecked; the Executive had too much power, and that there was no check on the executive; a dictator would arise; and that a bill of rights should be coupled with the constitution to prevent a dictator (then believed to eventually be the president) from exploiting or tyrannizing citizens. The federalists, on the other hand, argued that it was impossible to list all the rights, and those that were not listed could be easily overlooked because they were not in the official bill of rights. Rather, rights in specific cases were to be decided by the judicial system of courts.\\r\\nAfter the American Civil War, the federal government increased greatly in influence on everyday life and in size relative to the state governments. Reasons included the need to regulate businesses and industries that span state borders, attempts to secure civil rights, and the provision of social services. The federal government acquired no substantial new powers until the acceptance by the Supreme Court of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.\\r\\nFrom 1938 until 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court did not invalidate any federal statute as exceeding Congress' power under the Commerce Clause. Most actions by the federal government can find some legal support among the express powers, such as the Commerce Clause, whose applicability has been narrowed by the Supreme Court in recent years. In 1995 the Supreme Court rejected the Gun-Free School Zones Act in the Lopez decision, and also rejected the civil remedy portion of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 in the United States v. Morrison decision. Recently, the Commerce Clause was interpreted to include marijuana laws in the Gonzales v. Raich decision.\\r\\nDual federalism holds that the federal government and the state governments are co-equals, each sovereign.\\r\\nHowever, since the Civil War Era, the national courts often interpret the federal government as the final judge of its own powers under dual federalism. The establishment of Native American governments (which are separate and distinct from state and federal government) exercising limited powers of sovereignty, has given rise to the concept of \\"bi-federalism.\\"\\r\\nThe Federal War ended in 1863 with the signing of the Treaty of Coche by both the centralist government of the time and the Federal Forces. The United States of Venezuela were subsequently incorporated under a \\"Federation of Sovereign States\\" upon principles borrowed from the Articles of Confederation of the United States of America. In this Federation, each State had a \\"President\\" of its own that controlled almost every issue, even the creation of \\"State Armies,\\" while the Federal Army was required to obtain presidential permission to enter any given state.\\r\\nHowever, more than 140 years later, the original system has gradually evolved into a quasi-centralist form of government. While the 1999 Constitution still defines Venezuela as a Federal Republic, it abolished the Senate, transferred competences of the States to the Federal Government and granted the President of the Republic vast powers to intervene in the States and Municipalities.\\r\\nFederalism in the Kingdom of Belgium is an evolving system.\\r\\nBelgian federalism is a twin system which reflects both the\\r\\nOn one hand, this means that the Belgian political landscape, generally speaking, consists of only two components: the Dutch-speaking population represented by Dutch-language political parties, and the majority populations of Wallonia and Brussels, represented by their French-speaking parties. The Brussels region emerges as a third component.[25] This specific dual form of federalism, with the special position of Brussels, consequently has a number of political issueseven minor onesthat are being fought out over the Dutch/French-language political division. With such issues, a final decision is possible only in the form of a compromise. This tendency gives this dual federalism model a number of traits that generally are ascribed to confederalism, and makes the future of Belgian federalism contentious.[26][27]\\r\\nOn the other hand, Belgian federalism is federated with three components. An affirmative resolution concerning Brussels' place in the federal system passed in the parliaments of Wallonia and Brussels.[28][29] These resolutions passed against the desires of Dutch-speaking parties, who are generally in favour of a federal system with two components (i.e. the Dutch and French Communities of Belgium). However, the Flemish representatives in the Parliament of the Brussels Capital-Region voted in favour of the Brussels resolution, with the exception of one party. The chairman of the Walloon Parliament stated on July 17, 2008 that, \\"Brussels would take an attitude\\".[30] Brussels' parliament passed the resolution on July 18, 2008:\\r\\nThis aspect of Belgian federalism helps to explain the difficulties of partition; Brussels, with its importance, is linked to both Wallonia and Flanders and vice versa. This situation, however, does not erase the traits of a confederation in the Belgian system.\\r\\nCurrent examples of two-sided federalism:\\r\\nHistorical examples of two-sided federalism include:\\r\\nIt has been proposed in several unitary states to establish a federal system, for various reasons.\\r\\nChina is the largest unitary state in the world by both population and land area. Although China has had long periods of central rule for centuries, it is often argued that the unitary structure of the Chinese government is far too unwieldy to effectively and equitably manage the country's affairs. On the other hand, Chinese nationalists are suspicious of decentralization as a form of secessionism and a backdoor for national disunity; still others argue that the degree of autonomy given to provincial-level officials in the People's Republic of China amounts to a de facto federalism.\\r\\nShortly after the 2011 civil war, some people in Cyrenaica (in the eastern region of the country) began to call for the new regime to be federal, with the traditional three regions of Libya (Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, and Fezzan) being the constituent units. A group calling itself the \\"Cyrenaican Transitional Council\\" issued a declaration of autonomy on 6 March 2012; this move was rejected by the National Transitional Council in Tripoli.[31][32][33][34]\\r\\nThe Philippines is a unitary state with some powers devolved to Local Government Units (LGUs) under the terms of the Local Government Code. There is also one autonomous region, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Over the years various modifications have been proposed to the Constitution of the Philippines, including possible transition to a federal system as part of a shift to a parliamentary system. In 2004, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo established the Consultative Commission which suggested such a Charter Change but no action was taken by the Philippine Congress to amend the 1987 Constitution.\\r\\nSpain is a unitary state with a high level of decentralisation, often regarded as a federal system in all but name or a \\"federation without federalism\\".[35] The country has been quoted as being \\"an extraordinarily decentralized country\\", with the central government accounting for just 18% of public spending,[36] 38% for the regional governments, 13% for the local councils, and the remaining 31% for the social security system.[37] The current Spanish constitution has been implemented in such a way that, in many respects, Spain can be compared to countries which are undeniably federal.[38]\\r\\nHowever, in order to manage the tensions present in the Spanish transition to democracy, the drafters of the current Spanish constitution avoided giving labels such as 'federal' to the territorial arrangements.[39] Besides, unlike in the federal system, the main taxes are taken centrally from Madrid (except for the Basque Country and Navarre, which were recognized in the Spanish democratic constitution as charter territories drawing from historical reasons) and then distributed to the Autonomous Communities.\\r\\nAn explicit and legal recognition of federalism as such is promoted by parties such as Podemos, United Left and, more recently, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party. The Spanish Socialist party has recently considered the idea of enshrining a federal Spain, in part, due to the increase of the Spanish peripheral nationalisms and the Catalan proposal of self-determination referenda for creating a Catalan state in Catalonia, either independent or within Spain.[40][41][42]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom has traditionally been governed as a unitary state by the Westminster Parliament in London. Instead of adopting a federal model, the UK has relied on gradual devolution to decentralise political power. Devolution in the UK began with the Government of Ireland Act 1914 which granted home rule to Ireland as a constituent country of the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the partition of Ireland in 1921 which saw the creation of the sovereign Irish Free State (which eventually evolved into the modern day Republic of Ireland), Northern Ireland retained its devolved government through the Parliament of Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK to have such a body at this time. This body was suspended in 1972 and Northern Ireland was governed by direct rule during the period of conflict known as The Troubles.\\r\\nIn modern times, a process of devolution in the United Kingdom has decentralised power once again. Since the 1997 referendums in Scotland and Wales and the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, three of the four constituent countries of the UK now have some level of autonomy. Government has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly.[43][44] England does not have its own parliament and English affairs continue to be decided by the Westminster Parliament. In 1998 a set of eight unelected Regional assemblies, or chambers, was created to support the English Regional Development Agencies, but these were abolished between 2008 and 2010. The Regions of England continue to be used in certain governmental administrative functions.\\r\\nCritics of devolution often cite the West Lothian question, which refers to the voting power of non-English MPs on matters affecting only England in the UK Parliament. Scottish and Welsh nationalism have been increasing in popularity, and since the Scottish independence referendum, 2014 there has been a wider debate about the UK adopting a federal system with each of the four home nations having its own, equal devolved legislatures and law-making powers.[45]\\r\\nUK federal government was proposed as early as 1912 by the Member of Parliament for Dundee, Winston Churchill, in the context of the legislation for Irish Home Rule. In a speech in Dundee on 12 September, he proposed that England should also be governed by regional parliaments, with power devolved to areas such as Lancashire, Yorkshire, the Midlands and London as part of a federal system of government.[46][47]\\r\\nAnarchists are against the State but are not against political organization or \\"governance\\"so long as it is self-governance utilizing direct democracy. The mode of political organization preferred by anarchists, in general, is federalism or confederalism. However, the anarchist definition of federalism tends to differ from the definition of federalism assumed by pro-state political scientists. The following is a brief description of federalism from section I.5 of An Anarchist FAQ:\\r\\nFederalism also finds expression in ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church). For example, presbyterian church governance resembles parliamentary republicanism (a form of political federalism) to a large extent. In Presbyterian denominations, the local church is ruled by elected elders, some of which are ministerial. Each church then sends representatives or commissioners to presbyteries and further to a general assembly. Each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members. In this governmental structure, each component has some level of sovereignty over itself. As in political federalism, in presbyterian ecclesiology there is shared sovereignty.\\r\\nOther ecclesiologies also have significant representational and federalistic components, including the more anarchic congregational ecclesiology, and even in more hierarchical episcopal ecclesiology.\\r\\nSome Christians argue that the earliest source of political federalism (or federalism in human institutions; in contrast to theological federalism) is the ecclesiastical federalism found in the Bible. They point to the structure of the early Christian Church as described (and prescribed, as believed by many) in the New Testament. In their arguments, this is particularly demonstrated in the Council of Jerusalem, described in Acts chapter 15, where the Apostles and elders gathered together to govern the Church; the Apostles being representatives of the universal Church, and elders being such for the local church. To this day, elements of federalism can be found in almost every Christian denomination, some more than others.\\r\\nIn a federation, the division of power between federal and regional governments is usually outlined in the constitution. Almost every country allows some degree of regional self-government, in federations the right to self-government of the component states is constitutionally entrenched. Component states often also possess their own constitutions which they may amend as they see fit, although in the event of conflict the federal constitution usually takes precedence.\\r\\nIn almost all federations the central government enjoys the powers of foreign policy and national defense as exclusive federal powers. Were this not the case a federation would not be a single sovereign state, per the UN definition. Notably, the states of Germany retain the right to act on their own behalf at an international level, a condition originally granted in exchange for the Kingdom of Bavaria's agreement to join the German Empire in 1871. Beyond this the precise division of power varies from one nation to another. The constitutions of Germany and the United States provide that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the states. The Constitution of some countries like Canada and India, on the other hand, state that powers not explicitly granted to the provincial governments are retained by the federal government. Much like the US system, the Australian Constitution allocates to the Federal government (the Commonwealth of Australia) the power to make laws about certain specified matters which were considered too difficult for the States to manage, so that the States retain all other areas of responsibility. Under the division of powers of the European Union in the Lisbon Treaty, powers which are not either exclusively of European competence or shared between EU and state as concurrent powers are retained by the constituent states.\\r\\nWhere every component state of a federation possesses the same powers, we are said to find 'symmetric federalism'. Asymmetric federalism exists where states are granted different powers, or some possess greater autonomy than others do. This is often done in recognition of the existence of a distinct culture in a particular region or regions. In Spain, the Basques and Catalans, as well as the Galicians, spearheaded a historic movement to have their national specificity recognized, crystallizing in the \\"historical communities\\" such as Navarre, Galicia, Catalonia, and the Basque Country. They have more powers than the later expanded arrangement for other Spanish regions, or the Spain of the autonomous communities (called also the \\"coffee for everyone\\" arrangement), partly to deal with their separate identity and to appease peripheral nationalist leanings, partly out of respect to specific rights they had held earlier in history. However, strictly speaking Spain is not a federalism, but a decentralized administrative organization of the state.\\r\\nIt is common that during the historical evolution of a federation there is a gradual movement of power from the component states to the centre, as the federal government acquires additional powers, sometimes to deal with unforeseen circumstances. The acquisition of new powers by a federal government may occur through formal constitutional amendment or simply through a broadening of the interpretation of a government's existing constitutional powers given by the courts.\\r\\nUsually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (municpios) with their own legislative council (camara de vereadores) and a mayor (prefeito), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a \\"little constitution\\", called \\"organic law\\" (lei organica). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (municipio libre, \\"free municipality\\") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.\\r\\nFederations often employ the paradox of being a union of states, while still being states (or having aspects of statehood) in themselves. For example, James Madison (author of the US Constitution) wrote in Federalist Paper No. 39 that the US Constitution \\"is in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both. In its foundation, it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the Government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national...\\" This stems from the fact that states in the US maintain all sovereignty that they do not yield to the federation by their own consent. This was reaffirmed by the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reserves all powers and rights that are not delegated to the Federal Government as left to the States and to the people.\\r\\nThe structures of most federal governments incorporate mechanisms to protect the rights of component states. One method, known as 'intrastate federalism', is to directly represent the governments of component states in federal political institutions. Where a federation has a bicameral legislature the upper house is often used to represent the component states while the lower house represents the people of the nation as a whole. A federal upper house may be based on a special scheme of apportionment, as is the case in the senates of the United States and Australia, where each state is represented by an equal number of senators irrespective of the size of its population.\\r\\nAlternatively, or in addition to this practice, the members of an upper house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component states, as occurred in the United States prior to 1913, or be actual members or delegates of the state governments, as, for example, is the case in the German Bundesrat and in the Council of the European Union. The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected, with apportionment in proportion to population, although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats.\\r\\nIn Canada, the provincial governments represent regional interests and negotiate directly with the central government. A First Ministers conference of the prime minister and the provincial premiers is the de facto highest political forum in the land, although it is not mentioned in the constitution.\\r\\nFederations often have special procedures for amendment of the federal constitution. As well as reflecting the federal structure of the state this may guarantee that the self-governing status of the component states cannot be abolished without their consent. An amendment to the constitution of the United States must be ratified by three-quarters of either the state legislatures, or of constitutional conventions specially elected in each of the states, before it can come into effect. In referendums to amend the constitutions of Australia and Switzerland it is required that a proposal be endorsed not just by an overall majority of the electorate in the nation as a whole, but also by separate majorities in each of a majority of the states or cantons. In Australia, this latter requirement is known as a double majority.\\r\\nSome federal constitutions also provide that certain constitutional amendments cannot occur without the unanimous consent of all states or of a particular state. The US constitution provides that no state may be deprived of equal representation in the senate without its consent. In Australia, if a proposed amendment will specifically impact one or more states, then it must be endorsed in the referendum held in each of those states. Any amendment to the Canadian constitution that would modify the role of the monarchy would require unanimous consent of the provinces. The German Basic Law provides that no amendment is admissible at all that would abolish the federal system.\\r\\nThe meaning of federalism, as a political movement, and of what constitutes a 'federalist', varies with country and historical context.[citation needed] Movements associated with the establishment or development of federations can exhibit either centralising or decentralising trends.[citation needed] For example, at the time those nations were being established, factions known as \\"federalists\\" in the United States and Australia advocated the formation of strong central government. Similarly, in European Union politics, federalists mostly seek greater EU integration. In contrast, in Spain and in post-war Germany, federal movements have sought decentralisation: the transfer of power from central authorities to local units. In Canada, where Quebec separatism has been a political force for several decades, the \\"federalist\\" impulse aims to keep Quebec inside Canada.\\r\\nFederalism, and other forms of territorial autonomy, is generally seen as a useful way to structure political systems in order to prevent violence among different groups within countries because it allows certain groups to legislate at the subnational level.[49] Some scholars have suggested, however, that federalism can divide countries and result in state collapse because it creates proto-states.[50] Still others have shown that federalism is only divisive when it lacks mechanisms that encourage political parties to compete across regional boundaries.[51]","input":"What are the two main types of federalism?"},{"output":"Chromolaena odorata","context":"Chromolaena odorata is a tropical and subtropical species of flowering shrub in the sunflower family. It is native to the Americas, from Florida and Texas in the United States south through Mexico and the Caribbean[2] to South America.[3] It has been introduced to tropical Asia, west Africa, and parts of Australia.[4][5][6] Common names include Siam weed, Christmas bush, devil weed, camphor grass, common floss flower, communist green and triffid.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChromolaena odorata is a rapidly growing perennial herb. It is a multi-stemmed shrub to 2.5 m (100 inches) tall in open areas. It has soft stems but the base of the shrub is woody. In shady areas it becomes etiolated and behaves as a creeper, growing on other vegetation. It can then become up to 10 m (33 feet) tall. The plant is hairy and glandular and the leaves give off a pungent, aromatic odour when crushed. The leaves are opposite, triangular to elliptical with serrated edges. Leaves are 4ÿ10?cm long by 1ÿ5?cm wide (up to 4 x 2 inches). Leaf petioles are 1ÿ4?cm long. The white to pale pink tubular flowers are in panicles of 10 to 35 flowers that form at the ends of branches. The seeds are achenes and are somewhat hairy. They are mostly spread by the wind, but can also cling to fur, clothes and machinery, enabling long distance dispersal. Seed production is about 80000 to 90000 per plant. Seeds need light to germinate. The plant can regenerate from the roots. In favorable conditions the plant can grow more than 3?cm per day.[8]\\r\\nIt was earlier taxonomically classified under the genus Eupatorium, but is now considered more closely related to other genera in the tribe Eupatorieae.[9]\\r\\nA recent review indicates that the ethno-pharmacological, funcigicidal, nematicidal importance of the plant and its use as a fallow species and as a soil fertility improvement plant in the slash and burn rotation system of agriculture has contributed to its continued use and spread in Nigeria.[10][11]\\r\\nChromolaena odorata is considered an invasive weed of field crops and natural environments in its introduced range.[12] It has been reported to be the most problematic invasive species within protected rainforests in Africa.[13] In Western Africa it prevents regeneration of tree species in areas of shifting cultivation. It affects species diversity in southern Africa. The plant's flammability affects forest edges.[14] In Sri Lanka it is a major weed in disturbed areas and coconut plantations.[7]\\r\\nBiological control with a defoliating artiid was attempted in the 1970s.[15]\\r\\nIn the Ashanti region of Ghana Pareuchaetes pseudoinsulata was introduced to some effect in a pilot study in the Ashanti region.[16]\\r\\nA renewed call for coordinated biological control effort in Nigeria was made in 2014, to attempt to bring the plant back into an ecological equilibrium.[10]\\r\\nIn Australia a systematic eradication programme with herbicide has been initiated.[17]\\r\\nIn the nineteenth century Chromolaena odorata escaped from the botanical gardens at Dacca (India), Java (Indonesia) and Peradeniya (Sri Lanka). In Western Africa the plant was accidentally introduced with forestry seeds. It was introduced as an ornamental in Southern Africa, and was introduced to Ivory Coast in 1952 to control Imperata grasses. It was first found in Queensland, Australia in 1994 and was perhaps introduced with foreign pasture seeds.[18] It is locally called Communist Pacha in the south Indian state Kerala as the plant was introduced there in the 1950s, the era when the Communists formed a government.\\r\\nChromolaena odorata contains carcinogenic pyrrolizidine alkaloids.[19] It is toxic to cattle.[7] It can also cause allergic reactions.[20] Recent research has shown the plant is larvicidal against all major mosquito vectors.[21]\\r\\n Media related to Chromolaena odorata at Wikimedia Commons  Data related to Chromolaena odorata at Wikispecies","input":"What is the botanical name of siam weed?"},{"output":"lithium-ion","context":"100ÿ265 W{h/kg[1][2]\\r\\n250ÿ693 W{h/L[3][4]\\r\\n400ÿ1200 cycles\\r\\nA lithium-ion battery or Li-ion battery (abbreviated as LIB) is a type of rechargeable battery in which lithium ions move from the negative electrode to the positive electrode during discharge and back when charging. Li-ion batteries use an intercalated lithium compound as one electrode material, compared to the metallic lithium used in a non-rechargeable lithium battery. The electrolyte, which allows for ionic movement, and the two electrodes are the constituent components of a lithium-ion battery cell.\\r\\nLithium-ion batteries are common in home electronics. They are one of the most popular types of rechargeable batteries for portable electronics, with a high energy density, tiny memory effect[9] and low self-discharge. LIBs are also growing in popularity for military, battery electric vehicle and aerospace applications.[10]\\r\\nChemistry, performance, cost and safety characteristics vary across LIB types. Handheld electronics mostly use LIBs based on lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO\\r\\n2), which offers high energy density, but presents safety risks, especially when damaged. Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO\\r\\n4), lithium ion manganese oxide battery (LiMn\\r\\n2O\\r\\n4, Li\\r\\n2MnO\\r\\n3, or LMO) and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNiMnCoO\\r\\n2 or NMC) offer lower energy density, but longer lives and less likelihood of unfortunate events in real world use, (e.g., fire, explosion, ...). Such batteries are widely used for electric tools, medical equipment, and other roles. NMC in particular is a leading contender for automotive applications. Lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (LiNiCoAlO\\r\\n2 or NCA) and lithium titanate (Li\\r\\n4Ti\\r\\n5O\\r\\n12 or LTO) are specialty designs aimed at particular niche roles. The newer lithiumÿsulfur batteries promise the highest performance-to-weight ratio.\\r\\nLithium-ion batteries can pose unique safety hazards since they contain a flammable electrolyte and may be kept pressurized. An expert notes \\"If a battery cell is charged too quickly, it can cause a short circuit, leading to explosions and fires\\".[11] Because of these risks, testing standards are more stringent than those for acid-electrolyte batteries, requiring both a broader range of test conditions and additional battery-specific tests.[12][13][14] There have been battery-related recalls by some companies, including the 2016 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall for battery fires.[15][16]\\r\\nResearch areas for lithium-ion batteries include life extension, energy density, safety, cost reduction and charging speed,[17] among others.\\r\\nInternational industry standards differentiate between a \\"cell\\" and a \\"battery\\".[14][18] A \\"cell\\" is a basic electrochemical unit that contains the electrodes, separator, and electrolyte. A \\"battery\\" or \\"battery pack\\" is a collection of cells or cell assemblies which are ready for use, as it contains an appropriate housing, electrical interconnections, and possibly electronics to control and protect the cells from failure.[19][20] (\\"Failure\\" in this case is used in the engineering sense and may include thermal runaway, fire, and explosion as well as more benign events such as loss of charge capacity.) In this regard, the simplest \\"battery\\" is a single cell.\\r\\nFor example, battery electric vehicles,[21] may have a battery system of 400 V, made of many individual cells. The term \\"module\\" is often used, where a battery pack is made of modules, and modules are composed of individual cells.[20][21]\\r\\nIn electrochemistry, the anode is the electrode where oxidation is taking place in the battery, i.e. electrons get free and flow out of the battery (technical current flowing into it). However, this happens on opposite electrodes during charge vs. discharge. The less ambiguous terms are positive (cathode on discharge) and negative (anode on discharge). This is the positive-negative polarity which is displayed on a volt meter.[22] For rechargeable cells, the term \\"cathode\\" designates the positive electrode in the discharge cycle, even when the associated electrochemical reactions change their places when charging and discharging, respectively. For lithium-ion cells the positive electrode (\\"cathode\\") is the lithium based one.\\r\\nLithium batteries were proposed by British chemist M Stanley Whittingham, now at Binghamton University, while working for Exxon in the 1970s.[23] Whittingham used titanium(IV) sulfide and lithium metal as the electrodes. However, this rechargeable lithium battery could never be made practical. Titanium disulfide was a poor choice, since it has to be synthesized under completely sealed conditions, also being quite expensive (~$1000 per kilogram for titanium disulfide raw material in 1970s). When exposed to air, titanium disulfide reacts to form hydrogen sulfide compounds, which have an unpleasant odour and are toxic to most animals. For this, and other reasons, Exxon discontinued development of Whittingham's lithium-titanium disulfide battery.[24] Batteries with metallic lithium electrodes presented safety issues, as lithium is a highly reactive element; it burns in normal atmospheric conditions because of spontaneous reactions with water and oxygen.[25] As a result, research moved to develop batteries in which, instead of metallic lithium, only lithium compounds are present, being capable of accepting and releasing lithium ions.\\r\\nReversible intercalation in graphite[26][27] and intercalation into cathodic oxides[28][29] was discovered during 1974ÿ76 by J. O. Besenhard at TU Munich. Besenhard proposed its application in lithium cells.[30][31] Electrolyte decomposition and solvent co-intercalation into graphite were severe early drawbacks for battery life.\\r\\nThere were two main trends in the research and development of electrode materials for lithium ion rechargeable batteries. One was the approach from the field of electrochemistry centering on graphite intercalation compounds,[50] and the other was the approach from the field of new nano-carbonaceous materials.[51]\\r\\nThe negative electrode of todays lithium ion rechargeable battery has its origins in PAS (polyacenic semiconductive material) discovered by Tokio Yamabe and later by Shjzukuni Yata in the early 1980s.[52][53][54][55] The seed of this technology, furthermore, was the discovery of conductive polymers by Professor Hideki Shirakawa and his group, and it could also be seen as having started from the polyacetylene lithium ion battery developed by Alan MacDiarmid and Alan J. Heeger et al.[56]\\r\\nThe performance and capacity of lithium-ion batteries increases as development progresses.\\r\\nAs of 2016[update], global lithium-ion battery production capacity was 28 gigawatt-hours, with 16.4 GWh in China.[65]\\r\\nIndustry produced about 660 million cylindrical lithium-ion cells in 2012; the 18650 size is by far the most popular for cylindrical cells. If Tesla meets its goal of shipping 40,000 Model S electric cars in 2014 and if the 85-kWh battery, which uses 7,104 of these cells, proves as popular overseas as it was in the U.S., in 2014 the Model S alone would use almost 40 percent of global cylindrical battery production.[66] Production is gradually shifting to higher-capacity 3,000+ mAh cells. Annual flat polymer cell demand was expected to exceed 700 million in 2013.[67]\\r\\nIn 2015 cost estimates ranged from $300ÿ500/kwh.[68]\\r\\nIn 2016 GM revealed they will be paying $145 / kWh for the batteries in the Chevy Bolt EV.[69]\\r\\nInformation came to light in 2011 regarding a long-term antitrust violating price-fixing conspiracy among the world's major lithium-ion battery manufacturers that kept prices artificially high from 2000 to 2011, according to a class action complaint that was tentatively settled with one of the defendants, Sony, in 2016.[70] The complaint provided evidence that participants included LG, Samsung SDI, Sanyo, Panasonic, Sony, and Hitachi, and notes that Sanyo and LG had \\"pled guilty to the criminal price-fixing of Lithium Ion Batteries\\".[70]\\r\\nSony agreed to settle for $20 million, and also cooperate by, among other things, making employees chosen by plaintiffs available for interviews, depositions and testimony, as well as provide clarifying information regarding the scheme and the documents provided to date, including responding to authentication and clarification questions.[71]Cooperation clause: pp. 23ÿ25.\\r\\nThe three primary functional components of a lithium-ion battery are the positive and negative electrodes and electrolyte. Generally, the negative electrode of a conventional lithium-ion cell is made from carbon. The positive electrode is a metal oxide, and the electrolyte is a lithium salt in an organic solvent.[72] The electrochemical roles of the electrodes reverse between anode and cathode, depending on the direction of current flow through the cell.\\r\\nThe most commercially popular negative electrode is graphite. The positive electrode is generally one of three materials: a layered oxide (such as lithium cobalt oxide), a polyanion (such as lithium iron phosphate) or a spinel (such as lithium manganese oxide).[73] Recently, graphene based electrodes (based on 2D and 3D structures of graphene) have also been used as electrodes for lithium batteries.[74]\\r\\nThe electrolyte is typically a mixture of organic carbonates such as ethylene carbonate or diethyl carbonate containing complexes of lithium ions.[75] These non-aqueous electrolytes generally use non-coordinating anion salts such as lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF\\r\\n6), lithium hexafluoroarsenate monohydrate (LiAsF\\r\\n6), lithium perchlorate (LiClO\\r\\n4), lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF\\r\\n4), and lithium triflate (LiCF\\r\\n3SO\\r\\n3).\\r\\nDepending on materials choices, the voltage, energy density, life, and safety of a lithium-ion battery can change dramatically. Recently, novel architectures using nanotechnology have been employed to improve performance.\\r\\nPure lithium is highly reactive. It reacts vigorously with water to form lithium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Thus, a non-aqueous electrolyte is typically used, and a sealed container rigidly excludes moisture from the battery pack.\\r\\nLithium-ion batteries are more expensive than NiCd batteries but operate over a wider temperature range with higher energy densities. They require a protective circuit to limit peak voltage.\\r\\nFor notebooks or laptops, lithium-ion cells are supplied as part of a battery pack with temperature sensors, voltage converter/regulator circuit, voltage tap, battery charge state monitor and the main connector. These components monitor the state of charge and current in and out of each cell, capacities of each individual cell (drastic change can lead to reverse polarities which is dangerous),[76][unreliable source?] and temperature of each cell and minimize the risk of short circuits.[77]\\r\\nLi-ion cells (as distinct from entire batteries) are available in various shapes, which can generally be divided into four groups:[78][full citation needed]\\r\\nCells with a cylindrical shape are made in a characteristic \\"swiss roll\\" manner (known as a \\"jelly roll\\" in the US), which means it is a single long sandwich of positive electrode, separator, negative electrode and separator rolled into a single spool. The main disadvantage of this method of construction is that the cell will have a higher series inductance.\\r\\nThe absence of a case gives pouch cells the highest gravimetric energy density; however, for many practical applications they still require an external means of containment to prevent expansion when their state-of-charge (SOC) level is high,[79] and for general structural stability of the battery pack of which they are part.\\r\\nSince 2011, several research groups have announced demonstrations of lithium-ion flow batteries that suspend the cathode or anode material in an aqueous or organic solution.[80]\\r\\nIn 2014, Panasonic created the smallest Li-ion battery. It is pin shaped. It has a diameter of 3.5mm and a weight of 0.6g.[81]\\r\\nThe reactants in the electrochemical reactions in a lithium-ion battery are the negative and positive electrodes and the electrolyte providing a conductive medium for lithium ions to move between the electrodes. Electrical energy flows out from or in to the battery when electrons flow through an external circuit during discharge or charge, respectively.\\r\\nBoth electrodes allow lithium ions to move in and out of their structures with a process called insertion (intercalation) or extraction (deintercalation), respectively. During discharge, the (positive) lithium ions move from the negative electrode (usually graphite = \\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\n6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathrm {C_{6}} }\\r\\n\\r\\n\\" as below) to the positive electrode (forming a lithium compound) through the electrolyte while the electrons flow through the external circuit in the same direction.[82] When the cell is charging, the reverse occurs with the lithium ions and electrons moved back into the negative electrode in a net higher energy state. The following equations exemplify the chemistry.\\r\\nThe positive (cathode) electrode half-reaction in the lithium-doped cobalt oxide substrate is:[83][84]\\r\\nThe negative (anode) electrode half-reaction for the graphite is:\\r\\nThe full reaction (left: charged, right: discharged) being:\\r\\nThe overall reaction has its limits. Overdischarge supersaturates lithium cobalt oxide, leading to the production of lithium oxide,[85] possibly by the following irreversible reaction:\\r\\nOvercharge up to 5.2 volts leads to the synthesis of cobalt(IV) oxide, as evidenced by x-ray diffraction:[86]\\r\\nIn a lithium-ion battery the lithium ions are transported to and from the positive or negative electrodes by oxidizing the transition metal, cobalt (Co), in Li\\r\\n1-xCoO\\r\\n2 from Co3+ to Co4+ during charge, and reducing from Co4+ to Co3+ during discharge. The cobalt electrode reaction is only reversible for x < 0.5 (x in mole units), limiting the depth of discharge allowable. This chemistry was used in the Li-ion cells developed by Sony in 1990.[87]\\r\\nThe cell's energy is equal to the voltage times the charge. Each gram of lithium represents Faraday's constant/6.941 or 13,901 coulombs. At 3 V, this gives 41.7 kJ per gram of lithium, or 11.6 kWh per kg. This is a bit more than the heat of combustion of gasoline, but does not consider the other materials that go into a lithium battery and that make lithium batteries many times heavier per unit of energy.\\r\\nThe cell voltages given in the Electrochemistry section are larger than the potential at which aqueous solutions will electrolyze.\\r\\nLiquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries consist of lithium salts, such as LiPF\\r\\n6, LiBF\\r\\n4 or LiClO\\r\\n4 in an organic solvent, such as ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate.[88] A liquid electrolyte acts as a conductive pathway for the movement of cations passing from the negative to the positive electrodes during discharge. Typical conductivities of liquid electrolyte at room temperature (20?C (68?F)) are in the range of 10?mS/cm, increasing by approximately 30ÿ40% at 40?C (104?F) and decreasing slightly at 0?C (32?F).[89]\\r\\nThe combination of linear and cyclic carbonates (e.g., ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC)) offers high conductivity and SEI-forming ability. A mixture of a high ionic conductivity and low viscosity carbonate solvents is needed, because the two properties are mutually exclusive in a single material.[22]\\r\\nOrganic solvents easily decompose on the negative electrodes during charge. When appropriate organic solvents are used as the electrolyte, the solvent decomposes on initial charging and forms a solid layer called the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI),[90] which is electrically insulating yet provides significant ionic conductivity. The interphase prevents further decomposition of the electrolyte after the second charge. For example, ethylene carbonate is decomposed at a relatively high voltage, 0.7?V vs. lithium, and forms a dense and stable interface.[91]\\r\\nComposite electrolytes based on POE (poly(oxyethylene)) provide a relatively stable interface.[92][93] It can be either solid (high molecular weight) and be applied in dry Li-polymer cells, or liquid (low molecular weight) and be applied in regular Li-ion cells.\\r\\nRoom temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are another approach to limiting the flammability and volatility of organic electrolytes.[94]\\r\\nDuring discharge, lithium ions (Li+) carry the current within the battery from the negative to the positive electrode, through the non-aqueous electrolyte and separator diaphragm.[95]\\r\\nDuring charging, an external electrical power source (the charging circuit) applies an over-voltage (a higher voltage than the battery produces, of the same polarity), forcing a charging current to flow within the battery from the positive to the negative electrode, i.e. in the reverse direction of a discharge current under normal conditions. The lithium ions then migrate from the positive to the negative electrode, where they become embedded in the porous electrode material in a process known as intercalation.\\r\\nThe charging procedures for single Li-ion cells, and complete Li-ion batteries, are slightly different.\\r\\nDuring the constant current phase, the charger applies a constant current to the battery at a steadily increasing voltage, until the voltage limit per cell is reached.\\r\\nDuring the balance phase, the charger reduces the charging current (or cycles the charging on and off to reduce the average current) while the state of charge of individual cells is brought to the same level by a balancing circuit, until the battery is balanced. Some fast chargers skip this stage. Some chargers accomplish the balance by charging each cell independently.\\r\\nDuring the constant voltage phase, the charger applies a voltage equal to the maximum cell voltage times the number of cells in series to the battery, as the current gradually declines towards 0, until the current is below a set threshold of about 3% of initial constant charge current.\\r\\nPeriodic topping charge about once per 500 hours. Top charging is recommended to be initiated when voltage goes below 4.05 V/cell.\\r\\nFailure to follow current and voltage limitations can result in an explosion.[12][96]\\r\\nCharging temperature limits for Li-ion are stricter than the operating limits. Lithium-ion chemistry performs well at elevated temperatures but prolonged exposure to heat reduces battery life.\\r\\nLi?ion batteries offer good charging performance at cooler temperatures and may even allow 'fast-charging' within a temperature range of 5 to 45?C (41 to 113?F).[97][better?source?needed] Charging should be performed within this temperature range. At temperatures from 0 to 5?C charging is possible, but the charge current should be reduced. During a low-temperature charge the slight temperature rise above ambient due to the internal cell resistance is beneficial. High temperatures during charging may lead to battery degradation and charging at temperatures above 45?C will degrade battery performance, whereas at lower temperatures the internal resistance of the battery may increase, resulting in slower charging and thus longer charging times.[97][better?source?needed]\\r\\nConsumer-grade lithium-ion batteries should not be charged at temperatures below 0?C (32?F). Although a battery pack[98] may appear to be charging normally, electroplating of metallic lithium can occur at the negative electrode during a subfreezing charge, and may not be removable even by repeated cycling. Most devices equipped with Li-ion batteries do not allow charging outside of 0ÿ45?C for safety reasons, except for mobile phones that may allow some degree of charging when they detect an emergency call in progress.[99]\\r\\nBecause lithium-ion batteries can have a variety of positive and negative electrode materials, the energy density and voltage vary accordingly.\\r\\nThe open circuit voltage is higher than aqueous batteries (such as lead acid, nickel-metal hydride and nickel-cadmium).[101][not in citation given] Internal resistance increases with both cycling and age.[101][not in citation given][102] Rising internal resistance causes the voltage at the terminals to drop under load, which reduces the maximum current draw. Eventually, increasing resistance will leave the battery in a state such that it can no longer support the normal discharge currents requested of it without unacceptable voltage drop or overheating.\\r\\nBatteries with a lithium iron phosphate positive and graphite negative electrodes have a nominal open-circuit voltage of 3.2?V and a typical charging voltage of 3.6?V. Lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide positives with graphite negatives have a 3.7?V nominal voltage with a 4.2?V maximum while charging. The charging procedure is performed at constant voltage with current-limiting circuitry (i.e., charging with constant current until a voltage of 4.2?V is reached in the cell and continuing with a constant voltage applied until the current drops close to zero). Typically, the charge is terminated at 3% of the initial charge current. In the past, lithium-ion batteries could not be fast-charged and needed at least two hours to fully charge. Current-generation cells can be fully charged in 45 minutes or less. In 2015 researchers demonstrated a small 600 mAh capacity battery charged to 68 percent capacity in two minutes and a 3,000 mAh battery charged to 48 percent capacity in five minutes. The latter battery has an energy density of 620 W{h/L. The device employed heteroatoms bonded to graphite molecules in the anode.[103]\\r\\nPerformance of manufactured batteries has improved over time. For example, from 1991 to 2005 the energy capacity per price of lithium ion batteries improved more than ten-fold, from 0.3 W{h per dollar to over 3 W{h per dollar.[104] In the period from 2011-2017, progress has averaged 7.5% annually.[105]\\r\\nThe increasing demand for batteries has led vendors and academics to focus on improving the energy density, operating temperature, safety, durability, charging time, output power, and cost of lithium ion battery technology. The following materials have been used in commercially available cells. Research into other materials continues.\\r\\nCathode materials are generally constructed out of two general materials: LiCoO\\r\\n2 and LiMn\\r\\n2O\\r\\n4. The cobalt-based material develops a pseudo tetrahedral structure that allows for two-dimensional lithium ion diffusion.[106] The cobalt-based cathodes are ideal due to their high theoretical specific heat capacity, high volumetric capacity, low self-discharge, high discharge voltage, and good cycling performance. Limitations include the high cost of the material, and low thermal stability.[107] The manganese-based materials adopt a cubic crystal lattice system, which allows for three-dimensional lithium ion diffusion.[106] Manganese cathodes are attractive because manganese is cheaper and because it could theoretically be used to make a more efficient, longer-lasting battery if its limitations could be overcome. Limitations include the tendency for manganese to dissolve into the electrolyte during cycling leading to poor cycling stability for the cathode.[107] Cobalt-based cathodes are the most common, however other materials are being researched with the goal of lowering costs and improving battery life.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2017[update] a candidate for large-scale production of lithium-ion batteries such as electric vehicle applications is LiFePO\\r\\n4 due to its low cost, excellent safety, high cycle durability (74% after 8000, 100% discharge for Sony Fortelion batteries)[109] and excellent performance, though a carbon conductive agent is required to overcome its low electrical conductivity.[110]\\r\\nElectrolyte alternatives have also played a significant role, for example the lithium polymer battery.\\r\\nNegative electrode materials are generally constructed from graphite and other carbon materials. These materials are used because they are abundant and are electrically conducting and can intercalate lithium ions to store electrical charge with modest volume expansion (ca. 10%).[122] The reason that graphite is the dominant material is because of its low voltage and excellent performance. Various materials have been introduced but their voltage is high leading to a low energy density.[123] Low voltage of material is the key requirement; otherwise, the excess capacity is useless in terms of energy density.\\r\\nAnother approach used carbon-coated 15?nm thick crystal silicon flakes. The tested half-cell achieved 1.2 Ah/g over 800 cycles.[130]\\r\\nSilicon is beginning to be looked at as an anode material because it can accommodate significantly more lithium ions, storing up to 10 times the electric charge, however this alloying between lithium and silicon results in significant volume expansion (ca. 400%),[122] which causes catastrophic failure for the battery.[131] Silicon has been used as an anode material but the insertion and extraction of Li+ can create cracks in the material. These cracks expose the Si surface to an electrolyte, causing decomposition and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the new Si surface (crumpled graphene encapsulated Si nanoparticles). This SEI will continue to grow thicker, deplete the available Li+, and degrade the capacity and cycling stability of the anode.\\r\\nThere have been attempts using various Si nanostructures that include nanowires, nanotubes, hollow spheres, nanoparticles, and nanoporous with the goal of them withstanding the (Li+)-insertion/removal without significant cracking. Yet the formation of SEI on Si still occurs. So a coating would be logical, in order to account for any increase in the volume of the Si, a tight surface coating is not viable. In 2012 researchers from Northwestern University created an approach to encapsulate Si nanoparticles using crumpled r-GO, graphene oxide. This method allows for protection of the Si nanoparticles from the electrolyte as well as allow for the expansion of Si without expansion due to the wrinkles and creases in the graphene balls.[132]\\r\\nThese capsules began as an aqueous dispersion of GO and Si particles, and are then nebulized into a mist of droplets that pass through a tube furnace. As they pass through the liquid evaporates, the GO sheets are pulled into a crumpled ball by capillary forces and encapsulate Si particles with them. There is a galvanostatic charge/discharge profile of 0.05 mA/cm^2 to 1 mA/cm^2 for current densities 0.2 to 4 A/g, delivering 1200 mAh/g at 0.2 A/g.[132]\\r\\nThe ions in the electrolyte diffuse because there are small changes in the electrolyte concentration. Linear diffusion is only considered here. The change in concentration, c, as a function of time t and distance x, is\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nc\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nc\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {\\\\partial c}{\\\\partial t}}=-{\\\\frac {D}{\\\\varepsilon }}{\\\\frac {\\\\partial c}{\\\\partial x}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe negative sign indicates the ions are flowing from high concentration to low concentration. In this equation, D is the diffusion coefficient for the lithium ion. It has a value of 7.5?G?10?10?m/s in the LiPF\\r\\n6 electrolyte. The value for , the porosity of the electrolyte, is 0.724.[133]\\r\\nLi-ion batteries provide lightweight, high energy density power sources for a variety of devices. To power larger devices, such as electric cars, connecting many small batteries in a parallel circuit is more effective[134] and more efficient than connecting a single large battery.[135] Such devices include:\\r\\nLi-ion batteries are used in telecommunications applications. Secondary non-aqueous lithium batteries provide reliable backup power to load equipment located in a network environment of a typical telecommunications service provider. Li-ion batteries compliant with specific technical criteria are recommended for deployment in the Outside Plant (OSP) at locations such as Controlled Environmental Vaults (CEVs), Electronic Equipment Enclosures (EEEs), and huts, and in uncontrolled structures such as cabinets. In such applications, li-ion battery users require detailed, battery-specific hazardous material information, plus appropriate fire-fighting procedures, to meet regulatory requirements and to protect employees and surrounding equipment.[140]\\r\\nBatteries gradually self-discharge even if not connected and delivering current. Li+ rechargeable batteries have a self-discharge rate typically stated by manufacturers to be 1.5-2% per month.[141][142]\\r\\nThe rate increases with temperature and state of charge. A 2004 study found that for most cycling conditions self-discharge was primarily time-dependent; however, after several months of stand on open circuit or float charge, state-of-charge dependent losses became significant. The self-discharge rate did not increase monotonically with state-of-charge, but dropped somewhat at intermediate states of charge.[143] Self-discharge rates may increase as batteries age.[144] In 1999, self-discharge per month was measured at 8% at 21 C, 15% at 40 C, 31% at 60 C.[145] By 2007, monthly self-discharge rate was estimated at 2% to 3%,[146] and 2[7]-3% by 2016.[147]\\r\\nBy comparison, the self-discharge rate for metal hydride (NiMH) batteries dropped, as of 2017, from up to 30% per month for previously common cells[148] to about 1.25% per month for low self-discharge NiMH batteries, and is about 10% per month in nickel-cadmium batteries.[citation needed]\\r\\nRechargeable battery life is typically defined as the number of full charge-discharge cycles before significant capacity loss. Inactive storage may also reduce capacity.\\r\\nManufacturers' information typically specify lifespan in terms of the number of cycles (e.g., capacity dropping linearly to 80% over 500 cycles), with no mention of chronological age.[149] On average, lifetimes consist of 1000 cycles,[150] although battery performance is rarely specified for more than 500 cycles. This means that batteries of mobile phones, or other hand-held devices in daily use, are not expected to last longer than three years. Some batteries based on carbon anodes offer more than 10,000 cycles.[151]\\r\\nAs a battery discharges, its voltage gradually diminishes. When depleted below the protection circuit's low-voltage threshold (2.4 to 2.9 V/cell, depending on chemistry) the circuit disconnects and stops discharging until recharged. As discharge progresses, metallic cell contents plate onto its internal structure, creating an unwanted discharge path.[citation needed]\\r\\nDefining battery life via full discharge cycles, is the industry standard, but may be biased, since full depth of discharge (DoD)/recharge may itself diminish battery life, compared to cumulative Ah partial discharge/charge performance. Projection from the standard to specific use patterns may require additional factors, e.g. DoD, rate of discharge, temperature, etc.\\r\\nMultiplying the battery life (at rated cycle depth) by the capacity gives a total energy delivered over the life of the battery. From this one can calculate the cost per kWh of the power (including the cost of charging). This value reveals that battery power is currently expensive compared to other power sources.\\r\\nA 2015 study by Andreas Gutsch of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology found that lithium-ion battery lifespan could vary by a factor of five, with some Li-ion cells losing 30% of their capacity after 1,000 cycles, and others having better capacity after 5,000 cycles. The study also found that safety standards for some batteries were not met. For stationary energy storage it was estimated that batteries with lifespans of at least 3,000 cycles were needed for profitable operation.[citation needed]\\r\\nOver their lifespan, batteries degrade progressively with reduced capacity, cycle life, and safety due to chemical changes to the electrodes. Capacity loss/fade is expressed as a percentage of initial capacity after a number of cycles (e.g., 30% loss after 1,000 cycles). Fade can be separated into calendar loss and cycling loss. Calendar loss results from the passage of time and is measured from the maximum state of charge. Cycling loss is due to usage and depends on both the maximum state of charge and the depth of discharge.[22] Increased rate of self-discharge can be an indicator of internal short-circuit.[152]\\r\\nDegradation is strongly temperature-dependent; increasing if stored or used at above or below 25?C.[153] High charge levels and elevated temperatures (whether from charging or ambient air) hasten capacity loss.[101][not in citation given] Carbon anodes generate heat when in use. Batteries may be refrigerated to reduce temperature effects.[154][not in citation given]\\r\\nPouch and cylindrical cell temperatures depend linearly on the discharge current.[155] Poor internal ventilation may increase temperatures. Loss rates vary by temperature: 6% loss at 0?C (32?F), 20% at 25?C (77?F), and 35% at 40?C (104?F).[citation needed] In contrast, the calendar life of LiFePO\\r\\n4 cells is not affected by high charge states.[156][157][not in citation given]\\r\\nThe advent of the SEI layer improved performance, but increased vulnerability to thermal degradation. The layer is composed of electrolyte ÿ carbonate reduction products that serve both as an ionic conductor and electronic insulator. It forms on both the anode and cathode and determines many performance parameters. Under typical conditions, such as room temperature and the absence of charge effects and contaminants, the layer reaches a fixed thickness after the first charge, allowing the device to operate for years. However, operation outside such parameters can degrade the device via several reactions.[22]\\r\\nFive common exothermic degradation reactions can occur:[22]\\r\\nThe SEI layer that forms on the anode is a mixture of lithium oxide, lithium fluoride and semicarbonates (e.g., lithium alkyl carbonates).\\r\\nAt elevated temperatures, alkyl carbonates in the electrolyte decompose into insoluble Li\\r\\n2CO\\r\\n3?that increases film thickness, limiting anode efficiency. This increases cell impedance and reduces capacity.[153] Gases formed by electrolyte decomposition can increase the cell's internal pressure and are a potential safety issue in demanding environments such as mobile devices.[22]\\r\\nBelow 25?C, plating of metallic Lithium on the anodes and subsequent reaction with the electrolyte is leading to loss of cyclable Lithium.[153]\\r\\nExtended storage can trigger an incremental increase in film thickness and capacity loss.[22]\\r\\nCharging at greater than 4.2 V can initiate Li+?plating on the anode, producing irreversible capacity loss. The randomness of the metallic lithium embedded in the anode during intercalation results in dendrites formation. Over time the dendrites can accumulate and pierce the separator, causing a short circuit leading to heat, fire or explosion. This process is referred to as thermal runaway.[22]\\r\\nDischarging beyond 2 V can also result in capacity loss. The (copper) anode current collector can dissolve into the electrolyte. When charged, copper ions can reduce on the anode as metallic copper. Over time, copper dendrites can form and cause a short in the same manner as lithium.[22]\\r\\nHigh cycling rates and state of charge induces mechanical strain on the anode's graphite lattice. Mechanical strain caused by intercalation and de-intercalation creates fissures and splits of the graphite particles, changing their orientation. This orientation change results in capacity loss.[22]\\r\\nElectrolyte degradation mechanisms include hydrolysis and thermal decomposition.[22]\\r\\nAt concentrations as low as 10 ppm, water begins catalyzing a host of degradation products that can affect the electrolyte, anode and cathode.[22] LiPF\\r\\n6 participates in an equilibrium reaction with LiF and PF\\r\\n5. Under typical conditions, the equilibrium lies far to the left. However the presence of water generates substantial LiF, an insoluble, electrically insulating product. LiF binds to the anode surface, increasing film thickness.[22]\\r\\nLiPF\\r\\n6 hydrolysis yields PF\\r\\n5, a strong Lewis acid that reacts with electron-rich species, such as water. PF\\r\\n5 reacts with water to form hydrofluoric acid (HF) and phosphorus oxyfluoride. Phosphorus oxyfluoride in turn reacts to form additional HF and difluorohydroxy phosphoric acid. HF converts the rigid SEI film into a fragile one. On the cathode, the carbonate solvent can then diffuse onto the cathode oxide over time, releasing heat and thermal runaway.[22]\\r\\nDecomposition of electrolyte salts and interactions between the salts and solvent start at as low as 70 C. Significant decomposition occurs at higher temperatures. At 85 C transesterification products, such as dimethyl-2,5-dioxahexane carboxylate (DMDOHC) are formed from EC reacting with DMC.[22]\\r\\nLithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO\\r\\n2) is the most widely used cathode material. Lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O\\r\\n4) is a potential alternative because of its low cost and ease of preparation, but its relatively poor cycling and storage capabilities has prevented it from commercial acceptance.[22]\\r\\nCathode degradation mechanisms include manganese dissolution, electrolyte oxidation and structural disorder.[22]\\r\\nIn LiMnO\\r\\n4 hydrofluoric acid catalyzes the loss of metallic manganese through disproportionation of trivalent manganese:[22]\\r\\nMaterial loss of the spinel results in capacity fade. Temperatures as low as 50?C initiate Mn2+ deposition on the anode as metallic manganese with the same effects as lithium and copper plating.[153] Cycling over the theoretical max and min voltage plateaus destroys the crystal lattice via Jahn-Teller distortion, which occurs when Mn4+ is reduced to Mn3+ during discharge.[22]\\r\\nStorage of a battery charged to greater than 3.6 V initiates electrolyte oxidation by the cathode and induces SEI layer formation on the cathode. As with the anode, excessive SEI formation forms an insulator resulting in capacity fade and uneven current distribution.[22]\\r\\nStorage at less than 2 V results in the slow degradation of LiCoO\\r\\n2 and LiMn\\r\\n2O\\r\\n4 cathodes, the release of oxygen and irreversible capacity loss.[22]\\r\\nThe need to \\"condition\\" NiCd and NiMH batteries has leaked into folklore surrounding Li-ion batteries, but is unfounded. The recommendation for the older technologies is to leave the device plugged in for seven or eight hours, even if fully charged.[158] This may be a confusion of battery software calibration instructions with the \\"conditioning\\" instructions for NiCd and NiMH batteries.[159]\\r\\nLi-ion batteries require a battery management system to prevent operation outside each cell's safe operating area (max-charge, min-charge, safe temperature range) and to balance cells to eliminate state of charge mismatches. This significantly improves battery efficiency and increases capacity. As the number of cells and load currents increase, the potential for mismatch increases. The two kinds of mismatch are state-of-charge (SOC) and capacity/energy (\\"C/E\\"). Though SOC is more common, each problem limits pack charge capacity (mA{h) to that of the weakest cell.[citation needed]\\r\\nIf overheated or overcharged, Li-ion batteries may suffer thermal runaway and cell rupture.[160][161] In extreme cases this can lead to leakage, explosion or fire. To reduce these risks, many lithium-ion cells (and battery packs) contain fail-safe circuitry that disconnects the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range of 3ÿ4.2?V per cell.[87][148] or when overcharged or discharged. Lithium battery packs, whether constructed by a vendor or the end-user, without effective battery management circuits are susceptible to these issues. Poorly designed or implemented battery management circuits also may cause problems; it is difficult to be certain that any particular battery management circuitry is properly implemented. Lithium-ion cells are susceptible to damage outside the allowed voltage range that is typically within (2.5 to 3.65) V for most LFP cells. Exceeding this voltage range, even by small voltages (millivolts) results in premature aging of the cells and, furthermore, results in safety risks due to the reactive components in the cells.[162] When stored for long periods the small current draw of the protection circuitry may drain the battery below its shutoff voltage; normal chargers may then be useless since the BMS may retain a record of this battery (or charger) 'failure'. Many types of lithium-ion cells cannot be charged safely below 0?C.[163]\\r\\nOther safety features are required in each cell:[87]\\r\\nThese features are required because the negative electrode produces heat during use, while the positive electrode may produce oxygen. However, these additional devices occupy space inside the cells, add points of failure, and may irreversibly disable the cell when activated. Further, these features increase costs compared to nickel metal hydride batteries, which require only a hydrogen/oxygen recombination device and a back-up pressure valve.[148] Contaminants inside the cells can defeat these safety devices. Also, these features can not be applied to all kinds of cells, e.g. prismatic high current cells cannot be equipped with a vent or thermal interrupt. High current cells must not produce excessive heat or oxygen, lest there be a failure, possibly violent. Instead, they must be equipped with internal thermal fuses which act before the anode and cathode reach their thermal limits.\\r\\nShort-circuiting a battery will cause the cell to overheat and possibly to catch fire. Adjacent cells may then overheat and fail, possibly causing the entire battery to ignite or rupture. In the event of a fire, the device may emit dense irritating smoke.[164] The fire energy content (electrical + chemical) of cobalt-oxide cells is about 100 to 150 kJ/(A{h), most of it chemical.[76][unreliable source?][165]\\r\\nReplacing the lithium cobalt oxide positive electrode material in lithium-ion batteries with a lithium metal phosphate such as lithium iron phosphate improves cycle counts, shelf life and safety, but lowers capacity. As of 2006 these 'safer' lithium-ion batteries were mainly used in electric cars and other large-capacity battery applications, where safety is critical.[166]\\r\\nLithium-ion batteries, unlike rechargeable batteries with water-based electrolytes, have a potentially hazardous pressurised flammable liquid electrolyte, and require strict quality control during manufacture.[167] A faulty battery can cause a serious fire.[11] Faulty chargers can affect the safety of the battery because they can destroy the battery's protection circuit. While charging at temperatures below 0?C, the negative electrode of the cells gets plated with pure lithium, which can compromise the safety of the whole pack.\\r\\nWhile fire is often serious, it may be catastrophically so. In about 2010 large lithium-ion batteries were introduced in place of other chemistries to power systems on some aircraft; as of January?2014[update] there had been at least four serious lithium-ion battery fires, or smoke, on the Boeing 787 passenger aircraft, introduced in 2011, which did not cause crashes but had the potential to do so.[168][169]\\r\\nIn addition, several aircraft crashes have been attributed to burning Li-Ion batteries. UPS Airlines Flight 6 crashed in Dubai after its payload of batteries spontaneously ignited, progressively destroying critical systems inside the aircraft which eventually rendered it uncontrollable.\\r\\nSince Li-ion batteries contain less of toxic metals than other types of batteries which may contain lead or cadmium[87] they are generally categorized as non-hazardous waste. Li-ion battery elements including iron, copper, nickel and cobalt are considered safe for incinerators and landfills. These metals can be recycled,[170][171] but mining generally remains cheaper than recycling.[172] At present, not much is invested into recycling Li-ion batteries due to cost, complexity and low yield. The most expensive metal involved in the construction of the cell is cobalt. Lithium iron phosphate is cheaper but has other drawbacks. Lithium is less expensive than other metals used, but recycling could prevent a future shortage.[170] The manufacturing processes of nickel and cobalt, and the solvent, present potential environmental and health hazards.[173][174] Manufacturing a kg of Li-ion battery takes energy equivalent to 1.6?kg of oil.[175][176]\\r\\nIATA estimates that over a billion lithium cells are flown each year.[165]\\r\\nThe maximum size of each battery (whether installed in a device or as spare batteries) that can be carried is one that has an equivalent lithium content (ELC) not exceeding 8 grammes per battery. Except, that if only one or two batteries are carried, each may have an ELC of not more than 25 grammes each.[183] The ELC for any battery is found by multiplying the ampere-hour capacity of each cell by 0.3 and then multiplying the result by the number of cells in the battery.[183] The resultant calculated lithium content is not the actual lithium content but a theoretical figure solely for transportation purposes. When shipping lithium ion batteries however, if the total lithium content in the cell exceeds 1.5 g, the package must be marked as \\"Class 9 miscellaneous hazardous material\\".\\r\\nAlthough devices containing lithium-ion batteries may be transported in checked baggage, spare batteries may be only transported in carry-on baggage.[183] They must be protected against short circuiting, and example tips are provided in the transport regulations on safe packaging and carriage; e.g., such batteries should be in their original protective packaging or, \\"by taping over the exposed terminals or placing each battery in a separate plastic bag or protective pouch\\".[183][184] These restriction do not apply to a lithium-ion battery that is a part of a wheelchair or mobility aid (including any spare batteries) to which a separate set of rules and regulations apply.[183]\\r\\nSome postal administrations restrict air shipping (including EMS) of lithium and lithium-ion batteries, either separately or installed in equipment. Such restrictions apply in Hong Kong,[185] Australia and Japan.[186] Other postal administrations, such as the United Kingdom's Royal Mail may permit limited carriage of batteries or cells that are operative but totally prohibit handling of known defective ones, which is likely to prove of significance to those discovering faulty such items bought through mail-order channels.[187] The IATA provides details in its Lithium Battery Guidance document which the Royal Mail makes available.\\r\\nOn 16 May 2012, the United States Postal Service (USPS) banned shipping anything containing a lithium battery to an overseas address, after fires from transport of batteries.[188] This restriction made it difficult to send anything containing lithium batteries to military personnel overseas, as the USPS was the only method of shipment to these addresses; the ban was lifted on 15 November 2012.[189] United Airlines and Delta Air Lines excluded lithium-ion batteries in 2015 after an FAA report on chain reactions.[190][191][192]\\r\\nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner uses large lithium cobalt oxide[193] batteries, which are more reactive than newer types of batteries such as LiFePO\\r\\n4.[194][12]\\r\\nResearchers are actively working to improve the power density, safety, cycle durability (battery life), recharge time, cost, flexibility, and other characteristics, as well as research methods and uses, of these batteries.","input":"What type of battery is used in laptops?"},{"output":"100,000-year-old beads made from Nassarius shells","context":"Jewellery (British English) or jewelry (American English)[1] consists of small decorative items worn for personal adornment, such as brooches, rings, necklaces, earrings, pendants and bracelets. Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes, and the term is restricted to durable ornaments, excluding flowers for example. For many centuries metal, often combined with gemstones, has been the normal material for jewellery, but other materials such as shells and other plant materials may be used. It is one of the oldest type of archaeological artefact ÿ with 100,000-year-old beads made from Nassarius shells thought to be the oldest known jewellery.[2] The basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures but are often extremely long-lived; in European cultures the most common forms of jewellery listed above have persisted since ancient times, while other forms such as adornments for the nose or ankle, important in other cultures, are much less common.\\r\\nJewellery may be made from a wide range of materials. Gemstones and similar materials such as amber and coral, precious metals, beads, and shells have been widely used, and enamel has often been important. In most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol, for its material properties, its patterns, or for meaningful symbols. Jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every body part, from hairpins to toe rings, and even genital jewellery. The patterns of wearing jewellery between the sexes, and by children and older people can vary greatly between cultures, but adult women have been the most consistent wearers of jewellery; in modern European culture the amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in European culture.\\r\\nThe word jewellery itself is derived from the word jewel, which was anglicised from the Old French \\"jouel\\",[3] and beyond that, to the Latin word \\"jocale\\", meaning plaything. In British English, Indian English, New Zealand English, Hiberno-English, Australian English, and South African English it is spelled jewellery, while the spelling is jewelry in American English.[1] Both are used in Canadian English, though jewelry prevails by a two to one margin. In French and a few other European languages the equivalent term, joaillerie there, may also cover decorated metalwork in precious metal such as objets d'art and church items, not just objects worn on the person.\\r\\nHumans have used jewellery for a number of different reasons:\\r\\nMost cultures at some point have had a practice of keeping large amounts of wealth stored in the form of jewellery. Numerous cultures store wedding dowries in the form of jewellery or make jewellery as a means to store or display coins. Alternatively, jewellery has been used as a currency or trade good; an example being the use of slave beads.[citation needed]\\r\\nMany items of jewellery, such as brooches and buckles, originated as purely functional items, but evolved into decorative items as their functional requirement diminished.[5]\\r\\nJewellery can also symbolise group membership (as in the case, of the Christian crucifix or the Jewish Star of David) or status (as in the case of chains of office, or the Western practice of married people wearing wedding rings).\\r\\nWearing of amulets and devotional medals to provide protection or ward off evil is common in some cultures. These may take the form of symbols (such as the ankh), stones, plants, animals, body parts (such as the Khamsa), or glyphs (such as stylised versions of the Throne Verse in Islamic art).[6]\\r\\nIn creating jewellery, gemstones, coins, or other precious items are often used, and they are typically set into precious metals. Alloys of nearly every metal known have been encountered in jewellery. Bronze, for example, was common in Roman times. Modern fine jewellery usually includes gold, white gold, platinum, palladium, titanium, or silver. Most contemporary gold jewellery is made of an alloy of gold, the purity of which is stated in karats, indicated by a number followed by the letter K. American gold jewellery must be of at least 10K purity (41.7% pure gold), (though in the UK the number is 9K (37.5% pure gold) and is typically found up to 18K (75% pure gold). Higher purity levels are less common with alloys at 22 K (91.6% pure gold), and 24 K (99.9% pure gold) being considered too soft for jewellery use in America and Europe. These high purity alloys, however, are widely used across Asia, the Middle East and Africa.[citation needed] Platinum alloys range from 900 (90% pure) to 950 (95.0% pure). The silver used in jewellery is usually sterling silver, or 92.5% fine silver. In costume jewellery, stainless steel findings are sometimes used.\\r\\nOther commonly used materials include glass, such as fused-glass or enamel; wood, often carved or turned; shells and other natural animal substances such as bone and ivory; natural clay; polymer clay; Hemp and other twines have been used as well to create jewellery that has more of a natural feel. However, any inclusion of lead or lead solder will give an English Assay office (the building which gives English jewellery its stamp of approval, the Hallmark) the right to destroy the piece, however it is very rare for the assay office to do so.\\r\\nBeads are frequently used in jewellery. These may be made of glass, gemstones, metal, wood, shells, clay and polymer clay. Beaded jewellery commonly encompasses necklaces, bracelets, earrings, belts and rings. Beads may be large or small; the smallest type of beads used are known as seed beads, these are the beads used for the \\"woven\\" style of beaded jewellery. Another use of seed beads is an embroidery technique where seed beads are sewn onto fabric backings to create broad collar neck pieces and beaded bracelets. Bead embroidery, a popular type of handwork during the Victorian era, is enjoying a renaissance in modern jewellery making. Beading, or beadwork, is also very popular in many African and indigenous North American cultures.\\r\\nSilversmiths, goldsmiths, and lapidaries methods include forging, casting, soldering or welding, cutting, carving and \\"cold-joining\\" (using adhesives, staples and rivets to assemble parts).[7]\\r\\nDiamonds were first mined in India.[8] Pliny may have mentioned them, although there is some debate as to the exact nature of the stone he referred to as Adamas;[9] In 2005, Australia, Botswana, Russia and Canada ranked among the primary sources of gemstone diamond production.[10] There are negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas. Diamonds mined during the recent civil wars in Angola, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and other nations have been labelled as blood diamonds when they are mined in a war zone and sold to finance an insurgency.\\r\\nThe British crown jewels contain the Cullinan Diamond, part of the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found (1905), at 3,106.75 carats (621.35 g).\\r\\nNow popular in engagement rings, this usage dates back to the marriage of Maximilian I to Mary of Burgundy in 1477.[11]\\r\\nMany precious and semiprecious stones are used for jewellery. Among them are:\\r\\nSome gemstones (like pearls, coral, and amber) are classified as organic, meaning that they are produced by living organisms. Others are inorganic, meaning that they are generally composed of and arise from minerals.\\r\\nSome gems, for example, amethyst, have become less valued as methods of extracting and importing them have progressed. Some man-made gems can serve in place of natural gems, such as cubic zirconia, which can be used in place of diamond.[12]\\r\\nFor platinum, gold, and silver jewellery, there are many techniques to create finishes. The most common are high-polish, satin/matte, brushed, and hammered. High-polished jewellery is the most common and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. Satin, or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as diamonds. Brushed finishes give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal, leaving \\"brush strokes\\". Hammered finishes are typically created by using a rounded steel hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy texture.\\r\\nSome jewellery is plated to give it a shiny, reflective look or to achieve a desired colour. Sterling silver jewellery may be plated with a thin layer of 0.999 fine silver (a process known as flashing) or may be plated with rhodium or gold. Base metal costume jewellery may also be plated with silver, gold, or rhodium for a more attractive finish.\\r\\nJewellery has been used to denote status. In ancient Rome, only certain ranks could wear rings;[13] later, sumptuary laws dictated who could wear what type of jewellery. This was also based on rank of the citizens of that time. Cultural dictates have also played a significant role. For example, the wearing of earrings by Western men was considered effeminate in the 19th century and early 20th century. More recently, the display of body jewellery, such as piercings, has become a mark of acceptance or seen as a badge of courage within some groups but is completely rejected in others. Likewise, hip hop culture has popularised the slang term bling-bling, which refers to ostentatious display of jewellery by men or women.\\r\\nConversely, the jewellery industry in the early 20th century launched a campaign to popularise wedding rings for men, which caught on, as well as engagement rings for men, which did not, going so far as to create a false history and claim that the practice had medieval roots. By the mid-1940s, 85% of weddings in the U.S. featured a double-ring ceremony, up from 15% in the 1920s.[14] Religion has also played a role in societies influence. Islam, for instance, considers the wearing of gold by men as a social taboo,[15] and many religions have edicts against excessive display.[16] In Christianity, the New Testament gives injunctions against the wearing of gold, in the writings of the apostles Paul and Peter. In Revelation 17, \\"the great whore\\" or false religious system, is depicted as being \\"decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand.\\" (Rev. 17:4) For Muslims it is considered haraam for a man to wear gold.[17]\\r\\nThe history of jewellery is long and goes back many years, with many different uses among different cultures. It has endured for thousands of years and has provided various insights into how ancient cultures worked.\\r\\nThe first signs of jewellery came from the people in Africa. Perforated beads suggesting shell jewellery made from sea snail shells have been found dating to 75,000 years ago at Blombos Cave. In Kenya, at Enkapune Ya Muto, beads made from perforated ostrich egg shells have been dated to more than 40,000 years ago. In Russia, a stone bracelet and marble ring are attributed to a similar age.[18]\\r\\nLater, the European early modern humans had crude necklaces and bracelets of bone, teeth, berries, and stone hung on pieces of string or animal sinew, or pieces of carved bone used to secure clothing together. In some cases, jewellery had shell or mother-of-pearl pieces. A decorated engraved pendant dating to around 11,000 BC, and thought to be the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain, was found at the site of Star Carr in North Yorkshire in 2015.[19] In southern Russia, carved bracelets made of mammoth tusk have been found. The Venus of Hohle Fels features a perforation at the top, showing that it was intended to be worn as a pendant.\\r\\nAround seven-thousand years ago, the first sign of copper jewellery was seen.[5] In October 2012 the Museum of Ancient History in Lower Austria revealed that they had found a grave of a female jewellery worker ÿ forcing archaeologists to take a fresh look at prehistoric gender roles after it appeared to be that of a female fine metal worker ÿ a profession that was previously thought to have been carried out exclusively by men.[20]\\r\\nThe first signs of established jewellery making in Ancient Egypt was around 3,000ÿ5,000 years ago.[21] The Egyptians preferred the luxury, rarity, and workability of gold over other metals. In Predynastic Egypt jewellery soon began to symbolise political and religious power in the community. Although it was worn by wealthy Egyptians in life, it was also worn by them in death, with jewellery commonly placed among grave goods.\\r\\nIn conjunction with gold jewellery, Egyptians used coloured glass, along with semi-precious gems. The colour of the jewellery had significance. Green, for example, symbolised fertility. Lapis lazuli and silver had to be imported from beyond the countrys borders.\\r\\nEgyptian designs were most common in Phoenician jewellery. Also, ancient Turkish designs found in Persian jewellery suggest that trade between the Middle East and Europe was not uncommon. Women wore elaborate gold and silver pieces that were used in ceremonies.[21]\\r\\nBy approximately 5,000 years ago, jewellery-making had become a significant craft in the cities of Mesopotamia. The most significant archaeological evidence comes from the Royal Cemetery of Ur, where hundreds of burials dating 2900ÿ2300 BC were unearthed; tombs such as that of Puabi contained a multitude of artefacts in gold, silver, and semi-precious stones, such as lapis lazuli crowns embellished with gold figurines, close-fitting collar necklaces, and jewel-headed pins. In Assyria, men and women both wore extensive amounts of jewellery, including amulets, ankle bracelets, heavy multi-strand necklaces, and cylinder seals.[22]\\r\\nJewellery in Mesopotamia tended to be manufactured from thin metal leaf and was set with large numbers of brightly coloured stones (chiefly agate, lapis, carnelian, and jasper). Favoured shapes included leaves, spirals, cones, and bunches of grapes. Jewellers created works both for human use and for adorning statues and idols. They employed a wide variety of sophisticated metalworking techniques, such as cloisonn, engraving, fine granulation, and filigree.[23]\\r\\nExtensive and meticulously maintained records pertaining to the trade and manufacture of jewellery have also been unearthed throughout Mesopotamian archaeological sites. One record in the Mari royal archives, for example, gives the composition of various items of jewellery:\\r\\nThe Greeks started using gold and gems in jewellery in 1600 BC, although beads shaped as shells and animals were produced widely in earlier times. Around 1500 BC, the main techniques of working gold in Greece included casting, twisting bars, and making wire.[25] Many of these sophisticated techniques were popular in the Mycenaean period, but unfortunately this skill was lost at the end of the Bronze Age. The forms and shapes of jewellery in ancient Greece such as the armring (13th century BC), brooch (10th century BC) and pins (7th century BC), have varied widely since the Bronze Age as well. Other forms of jewellery include wreaths, earrings, necklace and bracelets. A good example of the high quality that gold working techniques could achieve in Greece is the Gold Olive Wreath (4th century BC), which is modeled on the type of wreath given as a prize for winners in athletic competitions like the Olympic Games. Jewellery dating from 600 to 475 BC is not well represented in the archaeological record, but after the Persian wars the quantity of jewellery again became more plentiful.[26] One particularly popular type of design at this time was a bracelet decorated with snake and animal-heads Because these bracelets used considerably more metal, many examples were made from bronze. By 300 BC, the Greeks had mastered making coloured jewellery and using amethysts, pearl, and emeralds. Also, the first signs of cameos appeared, with the Greeks creating them from Indian Sardonyx, a striped brown pink and cream agate stone. Greek jewellery was often simpler than in other cultures, with simple designs and workmanship. However, as time progressed, the designs grew in complexity and different materials were soon used.\\r\\nJewellery in Greece was hardly worn and was mostly used for public appearances or on special occasions. It was frequently given as a gift and was predominantly worn by women to show their wealth, social status, and beauty. The jewellery was often supposed to give the wearer protection from the \\"Evil Eye\\" or endowed the owner with supernatural powers, while others had a religious symbolism. Older pieces of jewellery that have been found were dedicated to the Gods.\\r\\nThey worked two styles of pieces: cast pieces and pieces hammered out of sheet metal. Fewer pieces of cast jewellery have been recovered. It was made by casting the metal onto two stone or clay moulds. The two halves were then joined together, and wax, followed by molten metal, was placed in the centre. This technique had been practised since the late Bronze Age. The more common form of jewellery was the hammered sheet type. Sheets of metal would be hammered to thickness and then soldered together. The inside of the two sheets would be filled with wax or another liquid to preserve the metal work. Different techniques, such as using a stamp or engraving, were then used to create motifs on the jewellery. Jewels may then be added to hollows or glass poured into special cavities on the surface. The Greeks took much of their designs from outer origins, such as Asia, when Alexander the Great conquered part of it. In earlier designs, other European influences can also be detected. When Roman rule came to Greece, no change in jewellery designs was detected. However, by 27 BC, Greek designs were heavily influenced by the Roman culture. That is not to say that indigenous design did not thrive. Numerous polychrome butterfly pendants on silver foxtail chains, dating from the 1st century, have been found near Olbia, with only one example ever found anywhere else.[27]\\r\\nAlthough jewellery work was abundantly diverse in earlier times, especially among the barbarian tribes such as the Celts, when the Romans conquered most of Europe, jewellery was changed as smaller factions developed the Roman designs. The most common artefact of early Rome was the brooch, which was used to secure clothing together. The Romans used a diverse range of materials for their jewellery from their extensive resources across the continent. Although they used gold, they sometimes used bronze or bone, and in earlier times, glass beads & pearl. As early as 2,000 years ago, they imported Sri Lankan sapphires and Indian diamonds and used emeralds and amber in their jewellery. In Roman-ruled England, fossilised wood called jet from Northern England was often carved into pieces of jewellery. The early Italians worked in crude gold and created clasps, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. They also produced larger pendants that could be filled with perfume.\\r\\nLike the Greeks, often the purpose of Roman jewellery was to ward off the \\"Evil Eye\\" given by other people. Although women wore a vast array of jewellery, men often only wore a finger ring. Although they were expected to wear at least one ring, some Roman men wore a ring on every finger, while others wore none. Roman men and women wore rings with an engraved gem on it that was used with wax to seal documents, a practice that continued into medieval times when kings and noblemen used the same method. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the jewellery designs were absorbed by neighbouring countries and tribes.[21]\\r\\nPost-Roman Europe continued to develop jewellery making skills. The Celts and Merovingians in particular are noted for their jewellery, which in terms of quality matched or exceeded that of Byzantium. Clothing fasteners, amulets, and, to a lesser extent, signet rings, are the most common artefacts known to us. A particularly striking Celtic example is the Tara Brooch. The Torc was common throughout Europe as a symbol of status and power. By the 8th century, jewelled weaponry was common for men, while other jewellery (with the exception of signet rings) seemed to become the domain of women. Grave goods found in a 6thÿ7th century burial near Chalon-sur-Sa?ne are illustrative. A young girl was buried with: 2 silver fibulae, a necklace (with coins), bracelet, gold earrings, a pair of hair-pins, comb, and buckle.[29] The Celts specialised in continuous patterns and designs, while Merovingian designs are best known for stylised animal figures.[30] They were not the only groups known for high quality work. Note the Visigoth work shown here, and the numerous decorative objects found at the Anglo-Saxon Ship burial at Sutton Hoo Suffolk, England are a particularly well-known example.[21] On the continent, cloisonn and garnet were perhaps the quintessential method and gemstone of the period.\\r\\nThe Eastern successor of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, continued many of the methods of the Romans, though religious themes came to predominate. Unlike the Romans, the Franks, and the Celts, however, Byzantium used light-weight gold leaf rather than solid gold, and more emphasis was placed on stones and gems. As in the West, Byzantine jewellery was worn by wealthier females, with male jewellery apparently restricted to signet rings. Woman's jewellery had some peculiarities like kolts that decorated headband. Like other contemporary cultures, jewellery was commonly buried with its owner.[31]\\r\\nThe Renaissance and exploration both had significant impacts on the development of jewellery in Europe. By the 17th century, increasing exploration and trade led to increased availability of a wide variety of gemstones as well as exposure to the art of other cultures. Whereas prior to this the working of gold and precious metal had been at the forefront of jewellery, this period saw increasing dominance of gemstones and their settings. An example of this is the Cheapside Hoard, the stock of a jeweller hidden in London during the Commonwealth period and not found again until 1912. It contained Colombian emerald, topaz, amazonite from Brazil, spinel, iolite, and chrysoberyl from Sri Lanka, ruby from India, Afghan lapis lazuli, Persian turquoise, Red Sea peridot, as well as Bohemian and Hungarian opal, garnet, and amethyst. Large stones were frequently set in box-bezels on enamelled rings.[32] Notable among merchants of the period was Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who brought the precursor stone of the Hope Diamond to France in the 1660s.\\r\\nWhen Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned as Emperor of the French in 1804, he revived the style and grandeur of jewellery and fashion in France. Under Napoleons rule, jewellers introduced parures, suites of matching jewellery, such as a diamond tiara, diamond earrings, diamond rings, a diamond brooch, and a diamond necklace. Both of Napoleons wives had beautiful sets such as these and wore them regularly. Another fashion trend resurrected by Napoleon was the cameo. Soon after his cameo decorated crown was seen, cameos were highly sought. The period also saw the early stages of costume jewellery, with fish scale covered glass beads in place of pearls or conch shell cameos instead of stone cameos. New terms were coined to differentiate the arts: jewellers who worked in cheaper materials were called bijoutiers, while jewellers who worked with expensive materials were called joailliers, a practice which continues to this day.\\r\\nStarting in the late 18th century, Romanticism had a profound impact on the development of western jewellery. Perhaps the most significant influences were the publics fascination with the treasures being discovered through the birth of modern archaeology and a fascination with Medieval and Renaissance art. Changing social conditions and the onset of the Industrial Revolution also led to growth of a middle class that wanted and could afford jewellery. As a result, the use of industrial processes, cheaper alloys, and stone substitutes led to the development of paste or costume jewellery. Distinguished goldsmiths continued to flourish, however, as wealthier patrons sought to ensure that what they wore still stood apart from the jewellery of the masses, not only through use of precious metals and stones but also though superior artistic and technical work. One such artist was the French goldsmith Fran?ois-Dsir Froment-Meurice. A category unique to this period and quite appropriate to the philosophy of romanticism was mourning jewellery. It originated in England, where Queen Victoria was often seen wearing jet jewellery after the death of Prince Albert, and it allowed the wearer to continue wearing jewellery while expressing a state of mourning at the death of a loved one.[33]\\r\\nIn the United States, this period saw the founding in 1837 of Tiffany & Co. by Charles Lewis Tiffany. Tiffany's put the United States on the world map in terms of jewellery and gained fame creating dazzling commissions for people such as the wife of Abraham Lincoln. Later, it would gain popular notoriety as the setting of the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. In France, Pierre Cartier founded Cartier SA in 1847, while 1884 saw the founding of Bulgari in Italy. The modern production studio had been born and was a step away from the former dominance of individual craftsmen and patronage.\\r\\nThis period also saw the first major collaboration between East and West. Collaboration in Pforzheim between German and Japanese artists led to Shakud plaques set into Filigree frames being created by the Stoeffler firm in 1885).[34] Perhaps the grand final ÿ and an appropriate transition to the following period ÿ were the masterful creations of the Russian artist Peter Carl Faberg, working for the Imperial Russian court, whose Faberg eggs and jewellery pieces are still considered as the epitome of the goldsmiths art.\\r\\nMany whimsical fashions were introduced in the extravagant eighteenth century. Cameos that were used in connection with jewellery were the attractive trinkets along with many of the small objects such as brooches, ear-rings and scarf-pins. Some of the necklets were made of several pieces joined with the gold chains were in and bracelets were also made sometimes to match the necklet and the brooch. At the end of the Century the jewellery with cut steel intermixed with large crystals was introduced by an Englishman, Matthew Boulton of Birmingham.[35]\\r\\nIn the 1890s, jewellers began to explore the potential of the growing Art Nouveau style and the closely related German Jugendstil, British (and to some extent American) Arts and Crafts Movement, Catalan Modernisme, Austro-Hungarian Sezession, Italian \\"Liberty\\", etc.\\r\\nArt Nouveau jewellery encompassed many distinct features including a focus on the female form and an emphasis on colour, most commonly rendered through the use of enamelling techniques including basse-taille, champleve, cloisonn, and plique--jour. Motifs included orchids, irises, pansies, vines, swans, peacocks, snakes, dragonflies, mythological creatures, and the female silhouette.\\r\\nRen Lalique, working for the Paris shop of Samuel Bing, was recognised by contemporaries as a leading figure in this trend. The Darmstadt Artists' Colony and Wiener Werkst?tte provided perhaps the most significant input to the trend, while in Denmark Georg Jensen, though best known for his Silverware, also contributed significant pieces. In England, Liberty & Co. and the British arts & crafts movement of Charles Robert Ashbee contributed slightly more linear but still characteristic designs. The new style moved the focus of the jeweller's art from the setting of stones to the artistic design of the piece itself. Lalique's dragonfly design is one of the best examples of this. Enamels played a large role in technique, while sinuous organic lines are the most recognisable design feature.\\r\\nThe end of World War I once again changed public attitudes, and a more sober style developed.[36]\\r\\nGrowing political tensions, the after-effects of the war, and a reaction against the perceived decadence of the turn of the 20th century led to simpler forms, combined with more effective manufacturing for mass production of high-quality jewellery. Covering the period of the 1920s and 1930s, the style has become popularly known as Art Deco. Walter Gropius and the German Bauhaus movement, with their philosophy of \\"no barriers between artists and craftsmen\\" led to some interesting and stylistically simplified forms. Modern materials were also introduced: plastics and aluminium were first used in jewellery, and of note are the chromed pendants of Russian-born Bauhaus master Naum Slutzky. Technical mastery became as valued as the material itself. In the West, this period saw the reinvention of granulation by the German Elizabeth Treskow, although development of the re-invention has continued into the 1990s. It is based on the basic shapes.\\r\\nIn Asia, the Indian subcontinent has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery making anywhere[citation needed], with a history of over 5,000 years.[37] One of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the Indus Valley Civilization, in what is now predominately modern-day Pakistan and part of northern and western India. Early jewellery making in China started around the same period, but it became widespread with the spread of Buddhism around 2,000 years ago.\\r\\nThe Chinese used silver in their jewellery more than gold. Blue kingfisher feathers were tied onto early Chinese jewellery and later, blue gems and glass were incorporated into designs. However, jade was preferred over any other stone. The Chinese revered jade because of the human-like qualities they assigned to it, such as its hardness, durability, and beauty.[5] The first jade pieces were very simple, but as time progressed, more complex designs evolved. Jade rings from between the 4th and 7th centuries BC show evidence of having been worked with a compound milling machine, hundreds of years before the first mention of such equipment in the west.[38]\\r\\nIn China, the most uncommon piece of jewellery is the earring, which was worn neither by men nor women.[citation needed] Amulets were common, often with a Chinese symbol or dragon. Dragons, Chinese symbols, and phoenixes were frequently depicted on jewellery designs.\\r\\nThe Chinese often placed their jewellery in their graves. Most Chinese graves found by archaeologists contain decorative jewellery.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian subcontinent (encompassing India, Pakistan and other countries of South Asia) has a long jewellery history, which went through various changes through cultural influence and politics for more than 5,000ÿ8,000 years. Because India had an abundant supply of precious metals and gems, it prospered financially through export and exchange with other countries. While European traditions were heavily influenced by waxing and waning empires, India enjoyed a continuous development of art forms for some 5,000 years.[37] One of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the Indus Valley Civilization (encompassing present-day Pakistan and north and northwest India). By 1500 BC, the peoples of the Indus Valley were creating gold earrings and necklaces, bead necklaces, and metallic bangles. Before 2100 BC, prior to the period when metals were widely used, the largest jewellery trade in the Indus Valley region was the bead trade. Beads in the Indus Valley were made using simple techniques. First, a bead maker would need a rough stone, which would be bought from an eastern stone trader. The stone would then be placed into a hot oven where it would be heated until it turned deep red, a colour highly prized by people of the Indus Valley. The red stone would then be chipped to the right size and a hole bored through it with primitive drills. The beads were then polished. Some beads were also painted with designs. This art form was often passed down through the family. Children of bead makers often learned how to work beads from a young age. Persian style also played a big role in Indias jewellery. Each stone had its own characteristics related to Hinduism.\\r\\nJewellery in the Indus Valley was worn predominantly by females, who wore numerous clay or shell bracelets on their wrists. They were often shaped like doughnuts and painted black. Over time, clay bangles were discarded for more durable ones. In present-day India, bangles are made out of metal or glass.[40] Other pieces that women frequently wore were thin bands of gold that would be worn on the forehead, earrings, primitive brooches, chokers, and gold rings. Although women wore jewellery the most, some men in the Indus Valley wore beads. Small beads were often crafted to be placed in men and womens hair. The beads were about one millimetre long.\\r\\nA female skeleton (presently on display at the National Museum, New Delhi, India) wears a carlinean bangle (bracelet) on her left hand. Kada is a special kind of bracelet and is widely popular in Indian culture. They symbolizes animals like peacock, elephant,[41] etc.\\r\\nAccording to Hindu belief, gold and silver are considered as sacred metals. Gold is symbolic of the warm sun, while silver suggests the cool moon. Both are the quintessential metals of Indian jewellery. Pure gold does not oxidise or corrode with time, which is why Hindu tradition associates gold with immortality. Gold imagery occurs frequently in ancient Indian literature. In the Vedic Hindu belief of cosmological creation, the source of physical and spiritual human life originated in and evolved from a golden womb (hiranyagarbha) or egg (hiranyanda), a metaphor of the sun, whose light rises from the primordial waters.[42]\\r\\nJewellery had great status with Indias royalty; it was so powerful that they established laws, limiting wearing of jewellery to royalty. Only royalty and a few others to whom they granted permission could wear gold ornaments on their feet. This would normally be considered breaking the appreciation of the sacred metals. Even though the majority of the Indian population wore jewellery, Maharajas and people related to royalty had a deeper connection with jewellery. The Maharaja's role was so important that the Hindu philosophers identified him as central to the smooth working of the world. He was considered as a divine being, a deity in human form, whose duty was to uphold and protect dharma, the moral order of the universe.[43]\\r\\nNavaratna (nine gems)is a powerful jewel frequently worn by a Maharaja (Emperor). It is an amulet, which comprises diamond, pearl, ruby, sapphire, emerald, topaz, cats eye, coral, and hyacinth (red zircon). Each of these stones is associated with a celestial deity, represented the totality of the Hindu universe when all nine gems are together. The diamond is the most powerful gem among the nine stones. There were various cuts for the gemstone. Indian Kings bought gemstones privately from the sellers. Maharaja and other royal family members value gem as Hindu God. They exchanged gems with people to whom they were very close, especially the royal family members and other intimate allies. \\"Only the emperor himself, his intimate relations, and select members of his entourage were permitted to wear royal turban ornament. As the empire matured, differing styles of ornament acquired the generic name of sarpech, from sar or sir, meaning head, and pech, meaning fastener.\\"\\r\\nIndia was the first country to mine diamonds, with some mines dating back to 296 BC. India traded the diamonds, realising their valuable qualities. Historically, diamonds have been given to retain or regain a lovers or rulers lost favour, as symbols of tribute, or as an expression of fidelity in exchange for concessions and protection. Mughal emperors and Kings used the diamonds as a means of assuring their immortality by having their names and wordly titles inscribed upon them. Moreover, it has played and continues to play a pivotal role in Indian social, political, economic, and religious event, as it often has done elsewhere. In Indian history, diamonds have been used to acquire military equipment, finance wars, foment revolutions, and tempt defections. They have contributed to the abdication or the decapitation of potentates. They have been used to murder a representative of the dominating power by lacing his food with crushed diamond. Indian diamonds have been used as security to finance large loans needed to buttress politically or economically tottering regimes. Victorious military heroes have been honoured by rewards of diamonds and also have been used as ransom payment for release from imprisonment or abduction.[44] Today, many of the jewellery designs and traditions are used, and jewellery is commonplace in Indian ceremonies and weddings.[39]\\r\\nJewellery played a major role in the fate of the Americas when the Spanish established an empire to seize South American gold. Jewellery making developed in the Americas 5,000 years ago in Central and South America. Large amounts of gold was easily accessible, and the Aztecs, Mixtecs, Mayans, and numerous Andean cultures, such as the Mochica of Peru, created beautiful pieces of jewellery.\\r\\nWith the Mochica culture, goldwork flourished. The pieces are no longer simple metalwork, but are now masterful examples of jewellery making. Pieces are sophisticated in their design, and feature inlays of turquoise, mother of pearl, spondylus shell, and amethyst. The nose and ear ornaments, chest plates, small containers and whistles are considered masterpieces of ancient Peruvian culture.[45]\\r\\nAmong the Aztecs, only nobility wore gold jewellery, as it showed their rank, power, and wealth. Gold jewellery was most common in the Aztec Empire and was often decorated with feathers from Quetzal birds and others. In general, the more jewellery an Aztec noble wore, the higher his status or prestige. The Emperor and his High Priests, for example, would be nearly completely covered in jewellery when making public appearances. Although gold was the most common and a popular material used in Aztec jewellery, jade, turquoise, and certain feathers were considered more valuable.[46] In addition to adornment and status, the Aztecs also used jewellery in sacrifices to appease the gods. Priests also used gem-encrusted daggers to perform animal and human sacrifices.[21][33]\\r\\nAnother ancient American civilization with expertise in jewellery making were the Maya. At the peak of their civilization, the Maya were making jewellery from jade, gold, silver, bronze, and copper. Maya designs were similar to those of the Aztecs, with lavish headdresses and jewellery. The Maya also traded in precious gems. However, in earlier times, the Maya had little access to metal, so they made the majority of their jewellery out of bone or stone. Merchants and nobility were the only few that wore expensive jewellery in the Maya region, much the same as with the Aztecs.[39]\\r\\nIn North America, Native Americans used shells, wood, turquoise, and soapstone, almost unavailable in South and Central America. The turquoise was used in necklaces and to be placed in earrings. Native Americans with access to oyster shells, often located in only one location in America, traded the shells with other tribes, showing the great importance of the body adornment trade in Northern America.[47]\\r\\nNative American jewellery is the personal adornment, often in the forms of necklaces, earrings, bracelets, rings, pins, brooches, labrets, and more, made by the Indigenous peoples of the United States. Native American jewellery reflects the cultural diversity and history of its makers. Native American tribes continue to develop distinct aesthetics rooted in their personal artistic visions and cultural traditions. Artists create jewellery for adornment, ceremonies, and trade. Lois Sherr Dubin writes, \\"[i]n the absence of written languages, adornment became an important element of Indian [Native American] communication, conveying many levels of information.\\" Later, jewellery and personal adornment \\"...signaled resistance to assimilation. It remains a major statement of tribal and individual identity.\\"[48]\\r\\nMetalsmiths, beaders, carvers, and lapidaries combine a variety of metals, hardwoods, precious and semi-precious gemstones, beadwork, quillwork, teeth, bones, hide, vegetal fibres, and other materials to create jewellery. Contemporary Native American jewellery ranges from hand-quarried and processed stones and shells to computer-fabricated steel and titanium jewellery.\\r\\nJewellery making in the Pacific started later than in other areas because of recent human settlement. Early Pacific jewellery was made of bone, wood, and other natural materials, and thus has not survived. Most Pacific jewellery is worn above the waist, with headdresses, necklaces, hair pins, and arm and waist belts being the most common pieces.\\r\\nJewellery in the Pacific, with the exception of Australia, is worn to be a symbol of either fertility or power. Elaborate headdresses are worn by many Pacific cultures and some, such as the inhabitants of Papua New Guinea, wear certain headdresses once they have killed an enemy. Tribesman may wear boar bones through their noses.\\r\\nIsland jewellery is still very much primal because of the lack of communication with outside cultures. Some areas of Borneo and Papua New Guinea are yet to be explored by Western nations. However, the island nations that were flooded with Western missionaries have had drastic changes made to their jewellery designs. Missionaries saw any type of tribal jewellery as a sign of the wearer's devotion to paganism. Thus many tribal designs were lost forever in the mass conversion to Christianity.[49]\\r\\nAustralia is now the number one supplier of opals in the world. Opals had already been mined in Europe and South America for many years prior, but in the late 19th century, the Australian opal market became predominant. Australian opals are only mined in a few select places around the country, making it one of the most profitable stones in the Pacific.[50]\\r\\nThe New Zealand Mori traditionally had a strong culture of personal adornment,[51] most famously the hei-tiki. Hei-tikis are traditionally carved by hand from bone, nephrite, or bowenite.\\r\\nNowadays a wide range of such traditionally inspired items such as bone carved pendants based on traditional fishhooks hei matau and other greenstone jewellery are popular with young New Zealanders of all backgrounds ÿ for whom they relate to a generalized sense of New Zealand identity. These trends have contributed towards a worldwide interest in traditional Mori culture and arts.\\r\\nOther than jewellery created through Mori influence, modern jewellery in New Zealand is multicultural and varied.[49]\\r\\nMost modern commercial jewellery continues traditional forms and styles, but designers such as Georg Jensen have widened the concept of wearable art. The advent of new materials, such as plastics, Precious Metal Clay (PMC), and colouring techniques, has led to increased variety in styles. Other advances, such as the development of improved pearl harvesting by people such as Mikimoto Kkichi and the development of improved quality artificial gemstones such as moissanite (a diamond simulant), has placed jewellery within the economic grasp of a much larger segment of the population.\\r\\nThe \\"jewellery as art\\" movement was spearheaded by artisans such as Robert Lee Morris and continued by designers such as Gill Forsbrook in the UK. Influence from other cultural forms is also evident. One example of this is bling-bling style jewellery, popularised by hip-hop and rap artists in the early 21st century, e.g. grills, a type of jewellery worn over the teeth.\\r\\nThe late 20th century saw the blending of European design with oriental techniques such as Mokume-gane. The following are innovations in the decades straddling the year 2000: \\"Mokume-gane, hydraulic die forming, anti-clastic raising, fold-forming, reactive metal anodising, shell forms, PMC, photoetching, and [use of] CAD/CAM.\\"[52]\\r\\nAlso, 3D printing as a production technique gains more and more importance. With a great variety of services offering this production method, jewellery design becomes accessible to a growing number of creatives. An important advantage of using 3d printing are the relatively low costs for prototypes, small batch series or unique and personalized designs. Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include Polyamide, steel and wax (latter for further processing). Every printable material has its very own constraints that have to be considered while designing the piece of jewellery using 3D Modelling Software.\\r\\nArtisan jewellery continues to grow as both a hobby and a profession. With more than 17 United States periodicals about beading alone, resources, accessibility, and a low initial cost of entry continues to expand production of hand-made adornments. Some fine examples of artisan jewellery can be seen at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.[53] The increase in numbers of students choosing to study jewellery design and production in Australia has grown in the past 20 years, and Australia now has a thriving contemporary jewellery community. Many of these jewellers have embraced modern materials and techniques, as well as incorporating traditional workmanship.\\r\\nMore expansive use of metal to adorn the wearer, where the piece is larger and more elaborate than what would normally be considered jewellery, has come to be referred to by designers and fashion writers as Metal Couture.[54][55]\\r\\nFreemasons attach jewels to their detachable collars when in Lodge to signify a Brothers Office held with the Lodge. For example, the square represents the Master of the Lodge and the dove represents the Deacon.\\r\\nJewellery used in body modification can be simple and plain or dramatic and extreme. The use of simple silver studs, rings, and earrings predominates. Common jewellery pieces such as, earrings are a form of body modification, as they are accommodated by creating a small hole in the ear.\\r\\nPadaung women in Myanmar place large golden rings around their necks. From as early as five years old, girls are introduced to their first neck ring. Over the years, more rings are added. In addition to the twenty-plus pounds of rings on her neck, a woman will also wear just as many rings on her calves. At their extent, some necks modified like this can reach 10ÿ15?in (25ÿ38?cm) long. The practice has health impacts and has in recent years declined from cultural norm to tourist curiosity.[56] Tribes related to the Paduang, as well as other cultures throughout the world, use jewellery to stretch their earlobes or enlarge ear piercings. In the Americas, labrets have been worn since before first contact by Innu and First Nations peoples of the northwest coast.[57] Lip plates are worn by the African Mursi and Sara people, as well as some South American peoples.\\r\\nIn the late twentieth century, the influence of modern primitivism led to many of these practices being incorporated into western subcultures. Many of these practices rely on a combination of body modification and decorative objects, thus keeping the distinction between these two types of decoration blurred.\\r\\nIn many cultures, jewellery is used as a temporary body modifier; in some cases, with hooks or other objects being placed into the recipient's skin. Although this procedure is often carried out by tribal or semi-tribal groups, often acting under a trance during religious ceremonies, this practice has seeped into western culture. Many extreme-jewellery shops now cater to people wanting large hooks or spikes set into their skin. Most often, these hooks are used in conjunction with pulleys to hoist the recipient into the air. This practice is said to give an erotic feeling to the person and some couples have even performed their marriage ceremony whilst being suspended by hooks.[56]\\r\\nAccording to a 2007 KPMG study,[58] the largest jewellery market is the United States with a market share of 30.8%, Japan, India, China, and the Middle East each with 8ÿ9%, and Italy with 5%. The authors of the study predict a dramatic change in market shares by 2015, where the market share of the United States will have dropped to around 25%, and China and India will increase theirs to over 13%. The Middle East will remain more or less constant at 9%, whereas Europe's and Japan's marketshare will be halved and become less than 4% for Japan, and less than 3% for the biggest individual European countries, Italy and the UK.","input":"When was the first piece of jewelry made?"},{"output":"June 29, 1776","context":"","input":"When was the city of san francisco founded?"},{"output":"a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation for satellite phone and low-speed data communications, somewhat similar to the Iridium satellite constellation and Orbcomm satellite systems","context":"Predecessor company Globalstar LP founded March 24, 1991; restructured as Globalstar, LLC in 2003.\\r\\nGlobalstar is a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation for satellite phone and low-speed data communications, somewhat similar to the Iridium satellite constellation and Orbcomm satellite systems. A Globalstar second-generation constellation will consist of 24 Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Globalstar project was launched in 1991 as a joint venture of Loral Corporation and Qualcomm. On March 24, 1994, the two sponsors announced formation of Globalstar LP, a limited partnership established in the U.S., with financial participation from eight other companies, including Alcatel, AirTouch, Deutsche Aerospace, Hyundai and Vodafone. At that time, the company predicted the system would launch in 1998, based on an investment of $1.8 billion.\\r\\nGlobalstar received its US spectrum allocation from the FCC in January 1995, and continued to negotiate with other nations for rights to use the same radio frequencies in their countries.\\r\\nThe first satellites were launched in February 1998, but system deployment was delayed due to a launch failure in September 1998 that resulted in the loss of 12 satellites in a launch by the Russian Space Agency. In February 2000, it launched the last of 52 satellites48 satellites and four in-orbit spares. Another eight unlaunched satellites were maintained as ground spares.\\r\\nThe first call on the original Globalstar system was placed on November 1, 1998, from Qualcomm chairman Irwin Jacobs in San Diego to Loral Space & Communications CEO and chairman Bernard Schwartz in New York City.\\r\\nIn October 1999, the system began \\"friendly user\\" trials with 44 of 48 planned satellites. In December 1999, the system began limited commercial service for 200 users with the full 48 satellites (no spares in orbit). In February 2000, it began full commercial service with its 48 satellites and 4 spares in North America, Europe and Brazil. Initial prices were $1.79/minute.\\r\\nOn February 15, 2002, the predecessor company Globalstar (old Globalstar) and three of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.\\r\\nIn 2004, restructuring of the old Globalstar was completed. The first stage of the restructuring was completed on December 5, 2003, when Thermo Capital Partners LLC was deemed to obtain operational control of the business, as well as certain ownership rights and risks. Thermo Capital Partners, became the principal owner.\\r\\nGlobalstar LLC was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in November 2003, and was converted into Globalstar, Inc., on March 17, 2006.\\r\\nIn 2007, Globalstar launched eight additional first-generation spare satellites into space to help compensate for the premature failure of their in-orbit satellites. Between 2010 and 2013, Globalstar launched 24 second-generation satellites in an effort to restore their system to full service.\\r\\nBetween 2010 and 2011, Globalstar moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Covington, Louisiana in part to take advantage of the state's tax breaks and low cost of living.[2]\\r\\nIn April 2018, Globalstar announced it would merge with FiberLight in a deal valued at $1.65 billion.[3]\\r\\nGlobalstar is a provider of mobile satellite voice and data services. Globalstar offers these services to commercial and recreational users in more than 120 countries around the world.\\r\\nThe Company's products include mobile and fixed satellite telephones, simplex and duplex satellite data modems and satellite airtime packages.\\r\\nIn late 2007, Globalstar subsidiary SPOT LLC launched a handheld satellite messaging and tracking personal safety device known as the SPOT Satellite Messenger.\\r\\nMany land based and maritime industries make use of the various Globalstar products and services from remote areas beyond the reach of cellular and landline telephone service.\\r\\nGlobal customer segments include: oil and gas, government, mining, forestry, commercial fishing, utilities, military, transportation, heavy construction, emergency preparedness, and business continuity as well as individual recreational users.\\r\\nGlobalstar data solutions are used for a variety of asset and personal tracking, data monitoring and \\"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\\" or SCADA applications.\\r\\nGlobalstar satellites are simple \\"bent pipe\\" analog repeaters,[4] unlike Iridium.[5]\\r\\nA network of ground gateway stations provides connectivity from the 40 satellites to the public switched telephone network and Internet. A satellite must have a Gateway station in view to provide service to any users it may see. Twenty Four Globalstar Gateways are located around the world, including 7 in North America.[6] Globalstar Gateways are the largest cellular base stations in the world with a design capacity for over 10,000 concurrent phone calls over a coverage area that is roughly 50% of the size of the USA. Globalstar supports CDMA technology such as the rake receiver and soft handoffs, so a handset may be talking via two spot beams to two Gateways for path diversity.\\r\\nGlobalstar users are assigned telephone numbers on the North American Numbering Plan in North America or the appropriate telephone numbering plan for the country that the overseas gateway is located in, except for Brazil, where the official Globalstar country code (+8818) is used. The use of gateway ground stations provides customers with localized regional phone numbers for their satellite handsets. But if there are no gateway stations to cover certain remote areas (such as areas of the South Pacific and the polar regions), service cannot be provided in these remote areas, even if the satellites may fly over them. As of May 2012, voice and full-duplex data service is currently non-functional over much of Africa, the South Asian subcontinent and most mid-ocean regions due to lack of nearby gateway earth stations.[7]\\r\\nThe Globalstar system uses the Qualcomm CDMA air interface; however, the Ericsson and Telit phones accept standard GSM SIM cards, while the Qualcomm GSP-1600/1700 phones do not have a SIM card interface, but use CDMA/IS-41 based authentication. Therefore, the Globalstar gateways need to support both the CDMA/IS-41 and the GSM standards.\\r\\nGlobalstar has roaming agreements with local cellular operators in some regions, enabling the use of a single phone number in satellite and cellular mode on multi-mode Globalstar handsets.[8] These cellular roaming agreements are not in place in North America. Because of improvements in cellular phones and networks and the limitations inherent to satellite phones, the newest Globalstar handset (released in 2006) does not include cellular connectivity as Globalstar does not expect subscribers to carry it as their only mobile phone.[9]\\r\\nGlobalstar orbits have an inclination of 52 degrees. Therefore, Globalstar does not cover polar areas, due to the lower orbital inclination.\\r\\nGlobalstar orbits have an orbital height of approximately 1400?km and latency is still relatively low (approximately 60ms).\\r\\nA Globalstar satellite has two body-mounted, Earth-facing arrays. First-generation Globalstars weigh approximately 550?kg, However, the second-generation Globalstar design will gain significant mass.\\r\\nIn 2005, some of the satellites began to reach the limit of their operational lifetime of 7.5 years. In December 2005, Globalstar began to move some of its satellites into a graveyard orbit above LEO.[10]\\r\\nAccording to documents filed with the SEC on January 30, 2007, Globalstar's previously identified problems with its S-band amplifiers used on its satellites for two-way communications are occurring at a higher rate than expected, possibly eventually leading to reduced levels of two-way voice and duplex data service in 2008. The company's simplex data services used to support the asset tracking products as well as the SPOT Satellite Messenger are not affected by the S-band satellite issue mentioned above. Globalstar also launched eight ground spare satellites in 2007 to help reduce the impact of the issue.\\r\\nIn the filing, Globalstar made the following statements:\\r\\n\\"Based on data recently collected from satellite operations, the Company has concluded that the degradation of the amplifiers is now occurring at a rate that is faster than previously experienced and faster than the Company had previously anticipated.\\"\\r\\n\\"Based on its most recent analysis, the Company now believes that, if the degradation of the S-band antenna amplifiers continues at the current rate or further accelerates, and if the Company is unsuccessful in developing additional technical solutions, the quality of two-way communications services will decline, and by some time in 2008 substantially all of the Companys currently in-orbit satellites will cease to be able to support two-way communications services.\\" [1]\\r\\nIndustry analysts speculate the problem is caused by radiation exposure the satellites receive when they pass through the South Atlantic Anomaly in their 876-mile (1414?km) altitude orbits.[11]\\r\\n\\"The S-band antenna amplifier degradation does not affect adversely the Companys one-way Simplex data transmission services, which utilize only the L-band uplink from a subscribers Simplex terminal to the satellites.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\"The Company is working on plans, including new products and services and pricing programs, and exploring the feasibility of accelerating procurement and launch of its second-generation satellite constellation, to attempt to reduce the effects of this problem upon its customers and operations. The Company will be able to forecast the duration of service coverage at any particular location in its service area and intends to make this information available without charge to its service providers, including its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, so that they may work with their subscribers to reduce the impact of the degradation in service quality in their respective service areas. The Company is also reviewing its business plan in light of these developments.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\"The Companys liquidity remains strong. At December 31, 2006, in addition to its credit agreement, the Company had unrestricted cash on hand and undrawn amounts under the Thermo Funding Company irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement of approximately $195 million.\\"[12]\\r\\nIn 2007, Globalstar launched eight spare satellites for its existing constellation with a view to reducing the gaps in its two-way voice and data services pending commercial availability of its second-generation satellite constellation, scheduled for initial launch in the second half of 2009. Globalstar will continue to operate its existing satellite constellation to provide and support services until the second-generation Globalstar satellites are available for service.\\r\\nUntil the new second-generation Globalstar satellite constellation is operational, Globalstar is offering its Optimum Satellite Availability Tool (OSAT) on its Internet site, which subscribers may use to predict when one or more unaffected satellites will be overhead at any specific geographic location.\\r\\nTo help customers deal with the S-band communication issues, Globalstar has provided a call times tool which calculates optimum calling times for a given location.\\r\\nIn December 2006, Globalstar announced that Alcatel Alenia Space, now Thales Alenia Space in its Cannes headquarters, has been awarded a ?661 million contract for the second-generation constellation. The satellites were designed with a life expectancy of 15 years, significantly longer than the design life of Globalstars first-generation constellation. The second generation constellation will consist of 24 satellites.[1]\\r\\nIn addition, Globalstar announced on April 3, 2007 that it has signed a ?9 million agreement with Thales Alenia Space to upgrade the Globalstar satellite constellation, including necessary hardware and software upgrades to Globalstars satellite control network facilities.[13]\\r\\nIn August 2008, Thales Alenia Space began production assembly, integration and testing of the second-generation flight model satellites, in its Rome factory, for launch as early as Q3 2009.[14]\\r\\nIn July 2009, Globalstar, Inc. announced that it has received complete financing for its second-generation satellite constellation and signed an amendment to the initial contract, specifying in particular the adjusted conditions for production and the new satellite delivery timetable.[15]\\r\\nThe first six second-generation satellites were launched on October 19, 2010, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.[16][17] The launch used a Soyuz-2 launch vehicle with a Fregat upper stage.[18] These second-generation satellites are expected to provide Globalstar customers with satellite voice and data services until at least 2025. Six more second-generation satellites were launched in July 2011[19] followed by another six satellites in December 2011.[20] As of July 16, 2012, 18 of 24 new satellites had been launched.[21] Launch of the second generation constellation was completed February 6, 2013, with the launch of the final six satellites using a Soyuz 2-1a launch vehicle.[22] The 24 second-generation spacecraft weighed approximately 700?kg (1,500?lb) each at launch, and are 3-axis stabilized.[23]\\r\\nPredecessor Company - Globalstar LP. In February 1995, Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd. raised $200 million from its initial public offering in the NASDAQ market. The IPO price of $20 per share was equivalent to $5 per share after two stock splits. The stock price peaked at (post split) $50 per share in January 2000, but institutional investors began predicting bankruptcy as early as June 2000. The stock price eventually fell below $1 per share, and the stock was delisted by NASDAQ in June 2001.\\r\\nAfter the IPO, the publicly traded Globalstar Telecommunications (NASDAQ symbol GSTRF) owned part of system operator Globalstar LP. From that point on, the primary financing for Globalstar LP was vendor financing from its suppliers (including Loral and Qualcomm), supplemented by junk bonds.\\r\\nAfter a total debt and equity investment of $4.3 billion, on February 15, 2002, Globalstar Telecommunications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing assets of $570 million and liabilities of $3.3 billion. The assets were later bought for $43 million by Thermo Capital Partners LLC.\\r\\nGlobalstar LLC and Globalstar, Inc. When the new Globalstar emerged from bankruptcy in April 2004, it was owned by Thermo Capital Partners (81.25%) and the original creditors of Globalstar L.P. (18.75%). Globalstar LLC was incorporated in April 2006 to become Globalstar, Inc.\\r\\nGlobalstar, Inc. completed an IPO in November 2006. The stock currently trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol GSAT.\\r\\nIn August 2007, Globalstar announced the introduction of the SPOT Satellite Messenger product, to be marketed through its latest subsidiary SPOT, Inc., later named SPOT LLC. The SPOT Messenger is manufactured by Globalstar partner Axonn LLC and combines the company's simplex data technology with a Nemerix GPS chipset. SPOT is intended to leverage Globalstar's still adequate L-Band uplink, which is used by simplex modems. The product was launched early November 2007.\\r\\nThe first five employees of Globalstar were transferred from the founding companies in 1991. Although few figures were publicly disclosed, the company apparently reached a peak of about 350 employees until layoffs in March 2001. However, this figure was misleading, as most of the development, operations and sales employees were employed by the companys strategic partners.[citation needed]\\r\\nLoral's chairman Bernard Schwartz served as Globalstars chairman and CEO until May 2001.\\r\\nThe company then appointed satellite telecommunications veteran Olof Lundberg to lead a turnaround at the company to serve as chairman and CEO. After beginning his career with Swedish Telecom, Lundberg had been founding Director General (later CEO) of Inmarsat from 1979 to 1995. He served as founding CEO and later CEO and Chairman ICO Global Communications from 1995 to 1999.\\r\\nLundberg resigned from the company (then in bankruptcy) on June 30, 2003.","input":"What is globalstar (mobile satellite service)?"},{"output":"guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge","context":"Blink-182 (often stylized as blink-182; pronounced \\"blink one eighty two\\") is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Since 2015, the lineup of the band has consisted of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Founded by guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action; in response, the band appended the meaningless number \\"-182\\".\\r\\nIn its early years, Blink-182 toured heavily behind the band's debut, Cheshire Cat (1995). The group signed with major label MCA Records to co-distribute its second album, Dude Ranch (1997). Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker. The group's next two releases, Enema of the State (1999) and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), were enormous successes on the strength of radio and MTV airplay. The eponymously titled Blink-182 followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group. DeLonge quit in 2005, sending the band into what was termed an \\"indefinite hiatus\\". They reunited in 2009, producing the trio's sixth album, Neighborhoods (2011). In 2015, DeLonge again exited and was replaced by Alkaline Trio guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. The band's seventh studio album, California, was released on July 1, 2016.\\r\\nBlink-182 is considered a key group in the development of pop punk; the band's combination of pop music melodies with fast-paced punk rock featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. The trio has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States,[2] and over 50 million albums worldwide.[3] In 2011, The New York Times asserted, \\"no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182,\\" and even as the band receded after its 2005 split, \\"its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss Warped Tour punk bands, like All Time Low and The Maine.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlink-182 was formed in Poway, California, a suburb outside of San Diego, in August 1992. Guitarist Tom DeLonge was expelled from Poway High for attending a basketball game drunk and was forced to attend another local school for one semester. At Rancho Bernardo High School, DeLonge performed at a Battle of the Bands competition, where he was introduced to drummer Scott Raynor.[5][6] He also befriended Kerry Key, who too was interested in punk music. Key's girlfriend, Anne Hoppus, introduced her brother, bassist Mark Hoppuswho had recently moved from Ridgecrest to work at a record store and attend collegeto DeLonge on August 1, 1992.[7] The two clicked instantly and played for hours in DeLonge's garage, exchanging lyrics and co-writing songsone of which became \\"Carousel\\".[7] Hoppus, in trying to impress Delonge, managed to fall from a lamppost in front of DeLonge's garage and crack his ankles, an injury that put him in crutches for three weeks.[8]\\r\\nTom DeLonge in 2013, reflecting on the band's foundation[9]\\r\\nThe trio began to practice together in Raynor's bedroom, spending hours together writing music, attending punk shows and movies, and playing practical jokes.[10] Hoppus and DeLonge would alternate singing vocal parts. The trio first operated under a variety of names, including Duck Tape and Figure 8, until DeLonge rechristened the band \\"Blink\\".[11] Hoppus' girlfriend was angered by her boyfriend's constant attention to the band, and demanded he make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band shortly after formation.[12] Shortly thereafter, DeLonge and Raynor borrowed a four-track recorder from friend and collaborator Cam Jones and were preparing to record a demo tape, with Jones on bass.[11] Hoppus promptly broke up with his girlfriend and returned to the band.[12] Flyswattera combination of original songs and punk coverswas recorded in Raynor's bedroom in May 1993.[13] Southern California had a large punk population in the early 1990s, aided by an avid surfing, skating, and snowboarding scene.[14] In contrast to East Coast punk music, the West Coast wave of groups, Blink included, typically introduced more melodic aspects to the group's music.[14] \\"New York is gloomy, dark and cold. It makes different music. The Californian middle-class suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about,\\" said DeLonge.[14] San Diego at this time was \\"hardly a hotbed of [musical] activity\\", but the band's popularity grew as did California punk rock concurrently in the mainstream.[13] DeLonge called clubs constantly in San Diego asking for a spot to play, as well as calling up local high schools, convincing them that Blink was a \\"motivational band with a strong antidrug message\\" in hopes to play at an assembly or lunch.[15]\\r\\nThe band was on stage nearly every weekend, even at Elks Lodges and YMCA centers.[15] The band soon became part of a circuit that also included the likes of Ten Foot Pole and Unwritten Law, and the band found its way onto the bill as the opening band for local acts at Soma, a local all-ages venue located on Market Street which the band longed to headline.[14] Big-name acts such as NOFX and Green Day played on the main floor, while smaller acts were relegated to the basement, an area referred to as \\"the Dungeon\\".[15] The original location closed its doors and relocated before the band would be promoted to the main stage (which required a 100+ crowd to attend). \\"Soma was like home away from home. All the punk kids who didnt give a fuck about football games and proms or whatever came to hang out at Soma,\\" claimed Hoppus.[15] The band's first big show on the main floor took place on a Thursday, where the band opened for Face to Face.[15] Hoppus' manager at the record store, Patrick Secor, fronted him the money to properly record another demo at local studio Doubletime.[17] The result was Buddha (1994), which the members of the band viewed as the band's first legitimate release.[16][17] By this time, the group had branched out to venues such as the Soul Kitchen in El Cajon, but Raynor's family relocated to Reno, Nevada, and he was briefly replaced by musician Mike Krull.[18] The band saved money and began flying Raynor out to shows, but eventually Raynor moved in with Hoppus for a summer in which the band would record its first album and music video and gain even more exposure.[19]\\r\\nThe heart of the local independent music scene was Cargo Records, which offered to sign the band on a \\"trial basis,\\" with help from O, guitarist for local punk band Fluf, and Brahm Goodis, friend of the band whose father was president of the label.[20] Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor.[21] The band recorded its debut album in three days at Westbeach Recorders in Los Angeles, fueled by both new songs and re-recordings of songs from previous demos.[22] Although Cheshire Cat, released in February 1995, made very little impact commercially, it is cited by fans and musicians as an iconic release.[23] \\"M+M's\\", the band's first single, garnered local radio airplay from 91X and Cargo offered the band a small budget to film a music video for it.[24] Meanwhile, the record also drew the attention of Irish band Blink. Unwilling to engage in a legal battle, the band agreed to change its name.[25] Cargo gave the band a week, but the trio put off the decision for more than two afterward. Eventually, Cargo called Blink-182, demanding that the band \\"change the name or [we'll] change it for you,\\" after which the band decided on a random number, 182.[26][27]\\r\\nThe band soon had a manager, Rick DeVoe, who associated with larger bands such as NOFX, Pennywise and The Offspring.[25] In addition, the band crucially drew the attention of Rick and Jean Bonde of the Tahoe booking agency, who were responsible for \\"spreading the name of the band far and wide and getting the group as many gigs as humanly possible.\\"[25][28] Surf film director Taylor Steele, friend of DeVoe, was preparing a national tour to promote his new surf video GoodTimes, and the band signed on for its first national tour, which extended as far as the East Coast. The band members purchased their own tour van and embarked on the GoodTimes tour with Unwritten Law, Sprung Monkey and 7 Seconds.[29] The GoodTimes tour continued and the band was whisked away to Australia, with Pennywise paying for the band's plane tickets.[30] Fletcher Dragge, guitarist of Pennywise, believed in the band strongly. He demanded Kevin Lyman, founder of the Warped Tour, sign the band for the 1996 festival, telling him that \\"they're gonna be gigantic.\\"[31] Australia was very receptive to the band and its humorous stage shows and pranks gained them a reputation, but also made them ostracized and considered a joke.[4][23]\\r\\nBy March 1996, the trio began to accumulate a genuine buzz among major labels, resulting in a bidding war between Interscope, MCA and Epitaph.[32] MCA promised the group complete artistic freedom and eventually signed the band,[33] but Raynor held a great affinity for Epitaph and began to feel half-invested in the band when it passed over the label.[34] The group, who were wary of purists attempting to define \\"punk\\" and discouraged by Cargo's lack of distribution and faith in the group, had no qualms about signing to a major label but were fiercely criticized in the punk community.[32][35][36] After nonstop touring, the trio began recording their follow-up, Dude Ranch, over the period of a month in late 1996.[37] The record hit stores the following summer and the band headed out on the 1997 Warped Tour. \\"Dammit\\", the album's lead single, received heavy airplay on modern rock stations.[38] Dude Ranch shipped gold by 1998, but an exhaustive touring schedule brought tensions among the trio.[38] Raynor had been drinking heavily to offset personal issues, and he was fired by DeLonge and Hoppus in mid-1998 despite agreeing to attend rehab and quit drinking.[39][40] Travis Barker, drummer for tour-mate The Aquabats, filled in for Raynor, learning the 20-song setlist in 45 minutes before the first show.[41] By July, he joined the band full-time[40] and the band entered the studio with producer Jerry Finn later that year to begin work on its third album.[23]\\r\\nWith the release of the group's third album Enema of the State in June 1999, Blink-182 was catapulted to stardom and became the biggest pop punk act of the era.[23] Three singles were released from the record\\"What's My Age Again?\\", \\"All the Small Things\\", and \\"Adam's Song\\"that became major radio hits and MTV staples.[43] \\"All the Small Things\\" became a number-one hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, but also became a crossover hit and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Its video parodied boy bands and pop music videos and won Best Group Video at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards.[27][44][45] Although the band was criticized as synthesized, manufactured pop only remotely resembling punk and pigeonholed as a joke act due to the puerile slant of its singles and associating music videos, Enema of the State was an enormous commercial success. The album has sold over 15 million copies worldwide and had a considerable effect on pop punk music, inspiring a \\"second wave\\" of the genre and numerous acolytes.[23][46]\\r\\nAfter multi-platinum success, arena tours, and cameo appearances (American Pie), the band recorded Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), which debuted at number one in the United States, Canada, and Germany. Hit singles \\"The Rock Show\\",\\"Stay Together for the Kids\\" and \\"First Date\\" continued the band's mainstream success worldwide, with MTV cementing its image as video stars.[4] Finn returned to produce the record and was a key architect of the \\"polished\\" pop punk sound, and he served as an invaluable member of the band: part adviser, part impartial observer, he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound.[47] Recording sessions were sometimes contentious, as DeLonge strove for heavier and dirtier guitar-driven rock.[48] With time off from touring, he felt an \\"itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was,\\"[49][50] and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration.[51][52] Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project and Hoppus felt betrayed.[53] The event caused great division within the trio for some time and was an unresolved tension at the forefront of the band's later hiatus.[54] Barker also explored hip-hop influences and teamed up with Rancid's Tim Armstrong to form the rap rock band Transplants.[23]\\r\\nThe band regrouped in 2003 to record its fifth studio album, infusing experimentalist elements into its usual pop punk sound, inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side projects. Blink's eponymous fifth studio album was released in the fall of 2003 through Geffen Records, which absorbed sister label MCA earlier that year.[55] The worldwide touring schedule, which saw the band travel to Japan and Australia, also found the three performing for troops stationed in the Persian Gulf.[56][57] Critics generally complimented the new, more \\"mature\\" direction taken for the album and its lead singles \\"Feeling This\\" and \\"I Miss You\\" charted high, with the latter becoming the group's second number one hit on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.[58] Fans, however, were split by the new direction, and tensions within the bandstemming from the grueling schedule and DeLonge's desire to spend more time with his familystarted to become evident.[23]\\r\\nIn February 2005, Geffen issued a press statement announcing the band's \\"indefinite hiatus.\\"[59] The band had broken up after members' arguments regarding their future and recording process. DeLonge felt increasingly conflicted both about his creative freedom within the group and the toll touring was taking on his family life.[60] He eventually expressed his desire to take a half-year respite from touring in order to spend more time with family. Hoppus and Barker were dismayed by his decision, which they felt was an overly long break.[61] The band abruptly canceled a performance at a Music for Relief benefit show after rehearsals grew more contentious.[23] Further arguments had ensued during rehearsals, rooted in the band members' increasing paranoia and bitterness toward one another.[62] DeLonge considered his bandmates' priorities \\"mad, mad different,\\" coming to the conclusion that the trio had simply grown apart as they aged, had families, and reached fame. The breakdown in communication led to heated exchanges, resulting in his exit from the group.[54]\\r\\nIn the interim, Hoppus and Barker continued playing music together in +44.[63] The group first began to lay down electronic demos in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room shortly after the breakup.[64] +44's debut, When Your Heart Stops Beating, was released the following year but stalled commercially and received mixed reviews.[65] Barker starred in the MTV reality series Meet the Barkers with his then-wife, former Miss USA Shanna Moakler. The couple's later split, reconciliation and subsequent breakup made them tabloid favorites.[66] Meanwhile, DeLonge disappeared from public eye, making no appearances, granting no interviews and remaining silent until September 2005, when he announced his new project, Angels & Airwaves, promising \\"the greatest rock and roll revolution for this generation.\\"[67] He later revealed he was addicted to painkillers at the time, recalling \\"I was losing my mind, I was on thousands of painkillers, and I almost killed myself,\\" and did not realize that his promise of revolution sounded highly ambitious.[68] The group released two albums in 2006 and 2007: We Don't Need to Whisper and I-Empire.[69] During the hiatus, Hoppus shifted his attention to producing albums (most notably Commit This to Memory by former tour-mate Motion City Soundtrack)[70] and hosting his podcast, HiMyNameisMark, while Barker launched a shoe line and worked on three other musical projectsthe Transplants, +44, and TRV$DJAM, a collaboration with friend Adam Goldstein (DJ AM).[67]\\r\\nThe band members did not speak from their breakup until 2008.[71] That August, Jerry Finn suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and was taken off life support.[72] On September 19, Barker and Goldstein were involved in a plane crash that killed four people, leaving the two the only survivors.[73] Barker sustained second and third degree burns and developed posttraumatic stress disorder, and the accident resulted in sixteen surgeries and 4-8 hour blood transfusions.[74] Hoppus was alerted about Barker's accident by a phone call in the middle of the night and jumped on the next flight to the burn center.[74] DeLonge found out via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight; within minutes, he was crying in his seat. \\"I thought he was going to die,\\" says DeLonge, who quickly reached out to his former bandmate, mailing him a letter and photograph. \\"Instantly after the plane crash, I was like, 'Hey, I want to play music with him again.'\\"[65][74] The trio eventually met up in the hospital, laying the grounds for what was going to be the band's reunion.[75] Eventually, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. The three opened up, discussing the events of the hiatus and their break-up, and DeLonge was the first to approach the subject of reuniting.[75] Hoppus remembered: \\"I remember [Tom] said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think we should continue with what we've been doing for the past 17 years. I think we should get back on the road and back in the studio and do what we love doing.'\\"[76][77]\\r\\nEventually, the band appeared for the first time on stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the February 2009 Grammy Awards, announcing their reunion.[78] The trio embarked on a reunion tour of North America from July to October 2009,[79] with a European trek following from August to September 2010.[80] The recording process for Neighborhoods, the band's sixth studio album, was stalled by its studio autonomy, tours, managers, and personal projects. DeLonge recorded at his studio in San Diego while Hoppus and Barker recorded in Los Angelesan extension of their strained communication.[49][81] The self-produced albumtheir first without producer Jerry Finn[47]was released in September 2011 and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200.[82] Its singles\\"Up All Night\\" and \\"After Midnight\\"only attracted modest chart success, and label Interscope was reportedly disappointed with album sales.[83]\\r\\n\\"Despite growing evidence of remaining friction between the members,\\"[84] the band continued to tour in the early 2010s. They headlined the 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour in North America from in 2011,[85] and toured Europe in 2012.[86] The band left Interscope Records that October,[87] and subsequently released Dogs Eating Dogs, an EP, in December 2012.[88] The trio toured Australia in 2013; Brooks Wackerman replaced Barker on drums as Barker was unwilling to fly after his plane crash.[89] These dates were followed with a small North American tour,[90] and a series of shows celebrating the tenth anniversary of the band's self-titled album that November.[91] The band played a European tour in August 2014, culminating in them headlining the Reading and Leeds Festivals; it was the band's fourth appearance at the festival and second headlining slot.[92]\\r\\nThe reunion of the band has been characterized as dysfunctional by both Barker and DeLonge.[93][94] Hoppus commented on this era of the band in a later interview: \\"Everything was always very contentious. There was always just a strange vibe. [...] I knew there was something wrong.\\"[94] In his memoir, Can I Say, Barker claims DeLonge's behavior on tour was \\"introverted\\" until \\"money started coming in,\\" after which \\"he'd get excited about Blink.\\" He states DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid-2014, and rejoined the following day.[95] The group planned to begin writing their seventh album in January 2015,[96] which had continually seen delays.[97] \\"I'd do interviews and I just felt awful for fans because they were promised albums for years and we couldn't do it,\\" Barker later said.[94] A record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended to spend more time on \\"non-musical activities\\" and indefinitely depart the group.[98] In his own statement, DeLonge remarked that he \\"Never planned on quitting, just find it hard as hell to commit.\\"[99] After these events, Barker summarized the band's reunion: \\"Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable.\\"[98]\\r\\nHoppus and Barker decided to continue on without DeLonge, and enlisted Alkaline Trio vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba to \\"fill in\\" for three shows in March 2015.[100] Hoppus and Skiba had been wanting to work together musically for several years, so he was the first and only person considered for the role.[101] After legal battles with DeLonge were worked out, Skiba joined Blink-182 as an official member and began preparations for new music.[102] The resulting album, California, was produced by John Feldmann. He was the group's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn.[103] California was recorded between January and March 2016. The band, as well as Feldmann, would regularly spend \\"18 hours\\" in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe.[104] \\"We all wanted to write the best record that we could [...] It does feel like a new beginning. It feels like when we used to tour and sleep in the van because that's all we wanted to do is play rock music,\\" said Hoppus.[105]\\r\\nUpon its July 2016 release, California became the band's second number-one album on the Billboard 200, and first in 15 years;[106] it also reached the top for the first time in the United Kingdom.[107] Its lead single, \\"Bored to Death\\", became the group's first number one single in 12 years.[108] The band supported the album with a large headlining tour across North America between July and October 2016,[109] and a European leg in June and July 2017.[110] A deluxe edition of Californiaessentially a double album including songs left off the original albumwas issued in 2017.[111][112] California earned the band their first nomination for Best Rock Album at the Grammy Awards.[113] Critical reviews of the album, however, were mixed; many considered Feldmann's input and the throwback nature of the songs as formulaic.[114][115]\\r\\nRecently, the band has taken time off and are preparing to record their eighth studio album.[116] \\"Somehow, Blink has had this resurgence like we never expected,\\" Hoppus told Kerrang! in July 2017. \\"I count myself lucky to have been [playing in the band] as long as I have.\\"[117]\\r\\nThe band signed a 16-date residency deal with the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The shows, known as \\"Kings of the Weekend,\\" will take place on select weekends beginning May 26, 2018. The last show is on November 17, 2018. [118][119]\\r\\nBlink-182 is mainly considered pop punk.[122][123][27][124] The band also has been described as skate punk[125][126][127][84] and punk rock.[128][129][130] The New York Times writes that the band \\"[took] punk's already playful core and [gave] it a shiny, accessible polish.\\"[4][131] The band is also considered alternative rock.[132][133][134] Blink-182's early albums such as Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch are considered skate punk and punk rock.[135][136][137][138][139] Blink-182 continued playing skate punk on the band's album Enema of the State.[140] Blink-182 emerged from a \\"nurturing, often slapstick\\" Southern California punk scene,[141] playing with groups like Guttermouth, NOFX and The Vandals, but the band's sound was criticized when it achieved mainstream popularity by several punk acts who wished to not be associated with the band's music.[142] The band's sound evolved with its 2003 untitled effort, which incorporated post-hardcore influences into deeper, darker pop territory.[143] Neighborhoods, released in 2011, combines arena rock, hip hop and indie rock inspiration.[144] The Sydney Morning Herald characterised the band's sound as a \\"mildly tough approach to pop melodies with a decided adolescent spin\\".[145]\\r\\nCommon lyrical themes include love, family, friends, and relationships.[146] In greater detail, this includes \\"adolescent aimlessness, broken hearts and general confusion over the care and feeding of girls.\\"[27] Lyrics in singles such as \\"What's My Age Again?\\" reflect age and maturity, while more serious compositions such as \\"Stay Together for the Kids\\" touch on the subject of divorce.[147] DeLonge said in a 1999 interview that the goal is to remain sincere and relatable, noting that the band takes its lyrics very seriously.[146] Despite this, the band gained a reputation for occasional lyrical toilet humor (Take Off Your Pants and Jacket). As the band members grew older, lyrical themes began to reflect the realities of adulthood, including relationship woes, daily pressures and unexpected hardships, most prominently explored on Blink-182 (2003).[57] On Neighborhoods, darker lyricism continues: themes concerning depression, addiction, loss and death were inspired by Barker's plane crash and the death of producer Jerry Finn.[148] Blink-182's influences include Fugazi, the Cure, Depeche Mode, New Order, U2, the Ramones, All, Stiff Little Fingers, Dinosaur Jr., NOFX, Bad Religion, Descendents, Refused, the Beatles, and Screeching Weasel.[149][150][151][152][153][154][155][156] DeLonge said that in his early days as a musician, what influenced him was \\"strictly the Descendents\\", saying \\"I was trying to emulate that band. Really punchy guitars, fast, simple and formulaic nursery rhyme love songs.\\"[49]\\r\\nAlternative Press, 2015[157]\\r\\nBlink-182 was one of the most popular bands at the turn of the millennium, and spearheaded the second wave of pop punk and its journey into the mainstream.[158] The glossy production instantly set Blink-182 apart from the other crossover punk acts of the era, such as Green Day.[4] Cheshire Cat is often cited by bands and fans as an iconic release and Dude Ranch has been called a \\"genuine modern punk classic.\\"[23][49] Enema of the State catapulted the band to stardom, creating what New York described as a \\"blanket immersion among America's twenty-some million teenagers.\\"[147] At the band's commercial peak, albums such as Take Off Your Pants and Jacket and Enema of the State sold over 14 and 15 million copies worldwide, respectively.[23][159] The band was featured alongside Green Day, Rancid, Bad Religion, NOFX, and The Offspring in One Nine Nine Four (2009), a documentary examining punk rock in California.[160]\\r\\nThe band never received particularly glowing reviews, with many reviewers dismissing them as a joke act based on the humorous slant of its music videos. British publication NME was particularly critical of the trio, begging them to \\"fuck right off,\\" and comparing them to \\"that sanitised, castrated, shrink-wrapped 'new wave' crap that the major US record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt to jump on the 'punk' bandwagon.\\"[161] Nevertheless, subsequent reviews of the band's discography have been more positive. Andy Greenwald of Blender wrote, \\"the quick transformation from nudists to near geniuses is down-right astonishing.\\"[162] James Montgomery of MTV called Blink-182 one of the \\"most influential bands of the past 20 years,\\" writing, \\"despite their maturation, Blink never took themselves particularly seriously, which was another reason they were so accessible.\\"[23]\\r\\n\\"When it comes to having inestimable influence, Blink-182 might well be contemporary punk's version of the Beatles\\", wrote Scott Heisel in a 2009 Alternative Press cover story on the band.[163] The same magazine later ranked Blink the fourth of the \\"30 Most Influential Bands of the Past 30 Years,\\" just behind Radiohead, Fugazi, and Nirvana.[157] The new generation of pop punk and alternative rock fans found the Blink sound \\"hugely influential,\\"[131] with Montgomery writing, \\"...?without them, there'd be no Fall Out Boy, no Paramore, or no Fueled by Ramen Records.\\"[23] In 2011, The New York Times asserted that \\"no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182,\\" stating that even as the band receded after its 2005 split, \\"its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss Warped Tour punk bands, like All Time Low and The Maine.\\"[4] Maria Sherman of The Village Voice took that sentiment a step further, writing \\"It's pretty simple: Blink-182 is the most important band of the '90s, dick jokes and all. Apart from the sound, Blink's ideology has been popularized [] their presence is everywhere.\\"[164] According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker, the group \\"emerged as a touchstone, spawning more imitators than any American rock band since Nirvana.\\"[165] Bands such as Panic! at the Disco and All Time Low originated covering Blink-182 songs.[166] \\"Anyone in our genre would be lying if they said they weren't influenced by Blink-182,\\" said Joel Madden of Good Charlotte.[167] Bands such as You Me at Six and 5 Seconds of Summer have also named the band as influences.[96]\\r\\nThe band's influence extends beyond pop punk groups as well: the band has been cited as an influence by Avril Lavigne,[168][169] Best Coast,[4] DIIV,[170] FIDLAR,[171] Grimes,[164] Male Bonding,[164] Mumford & Sons,[172] Owl City,[173] Posture & the Grizzly,[165] Tucker Beathard,[174] Wavves,[9] and the Chainsmokers;[175] the latter even mentioned the band in the lyrics of their number-one hit song \\"Closer\\".[175] Critics have noted traits of the band's sound in the music of Japandroids.[4][176]\\r\\nCurrent\\r\\nFormer\\r\\nFormer touring musicians\\r\\nTimeline","input":"Who are the original members of blink 182?"},{"output":"California","context":"(State-level legalization)\\r\\nThe legal history of cannabis in the United States began with state-level prohibition in the early 20th century, with the first major federal limitations occurring in 1937.

A possible inclination towards monotheism emerged during the Vedic period[15] in Iron-Age South Asia. The Rigveda exhibits notions of monism of the Brahman, particularly in the comparatively late tenth book,[16] which is dated to the early Iron Age, e.g. in the Nasadiya sukta. Bonpa Dharma, perhaps from twentieth century BCE,[17] was the first recorded religion to declare that there is one God above all, whom it calls Sangpo Bumtri.[18] However, it does not encourage monotheistic worship of a Sangpo Bumtri or any god for salvation but rather it focuses on karma.\\r\\nSince the sixth century BCE, Zoroastrians have believed in the supremacy of one God above all: Ahura Mazda as the \\"Maker of All\\"[19] and the first being before all others.[20][21][22][23] Nonetheless, Zoroastrianism was not strictly monotheistic[24] because it venerated other yazatas alongside Ahura Mazda. Ancient Hindu theology, meanwhile, was monist, but was not strictly monotheistic in worship because it still maintained the existence of many gods, who were envisioned as aspects of one supreme God, Brahman.[25] Numerous ancient Greek philosophers, including Xenophanes of Colophon and Antisthenes believed in a similar polytheistic monism that came close to monotheism, but fell short.[25] Judaism was the first religion to conceive the notion of a personal monotheistic God within a monist context.[25] The concept of ethical monotheism, which holds that morality stems from God alone and that its laws are unchanging,[26][27] first occurred in Judaism,[28] but is now a core tenet of most modern monotheistic religions, including Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and Bah' Faith.[29]\\r\\nAccording to Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, monotheism was the original religion of humanity; this original religion is sometimes referred to as \\"the Adamic religion\\", or, in the terms of Andrew Lang, the \\"Urreligion\\". Scholars of religion largely abandoned that view in the 19th century in favour of an evolutionary progression from animism via polytheism to monotheism, but by 1974 this theory was less widely held, and a modified view similar to Lang's became more prominent.[2][need quotation to verify] Austrian anthropologist Wilhelm Schmidt had postulated an Urmonotheismus, \\"original\\" or \\"primitive monotheism\\" in the 1910s.[30] It was objected[by whom?] that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam had grown up in opposition to polytheism as had Greek philosophical monotheism.[2] Karen Armstrong[31] and other authors have written that the concept of monotheism gradually developed through a series of periodic transitions; first came animism, which developed into polytheism, which developed into henotheism, which developed into monolatry, which developed into true monotheism.[32]\\r\\nWhile all adherents of the Abrahamic religions consider themselves to be monotheists, Judaism does not consider Christianity to be monotheistic, recognizing only Islam as monotheistic.[33] Islam likewise does not recognize modern-day Christianity as monotheistic, primarily due to the Christian doctrine of Trinity, which Islam argues was not a part of the original monotheistic Christianity as preached by Jesus.[34] Christians, on the other hand, argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is a valid expression of monotheism, citing that the Trinity does not consist of three separate deities, but rather the three persons, who exist consubstantially (as one substance) within a single Godhead.[35][36][37]\\r\\nJudaism is one of the oldest monotheistic religions in the world.[38] God in Judaism is strictly monotheistic,[39] an absolute one, indivisible, and incomparable being who is the ultimate cause of all existence. The Babylonian Talmud references other, \\"foreign gods\\" as non-existent entities to whom humans mistakenly ascribe reality and power.[40] One of the best-known statements of Rabbinical Judaism on monotheism is the Second of Maimonides' 13 Principles of faith:\\r\\nGod, the Cause of all, is one. This does not mean one as in one of a pair, nor one like a species (which encompasses many individuals), nor one as in an object that is made up of many elements, nor as a single simple object that is infinitely divisible. Rather, God is a unity unlike any other possible unity.[41]\\r\\nJudaism[42] and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Judaism uses the term shituf to refer to the worship of God in a manner which Judaism does not deem to be monotheistic.\\r\\nDuring the 8th century BCE, the worship of YHWH in Israel was in competition with many other cults, described by the Yahwist faction collectively as Baals. The oldest books of the Hebrew Bible reflect this competition, as in the books of Hosea and Nahum, whose authors lament the \\"apostasy\\" of the people of Israel, threatening them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their polytheistic cults.[43][44]\\r\\nAncient Israelite religion was originally polytheistic;[45] the Israelites worshipped many deities,[46] including El, Baal, Asherah, and Astarte. YHWH was originally the national god of the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah.[47] As time progressed, the henotheistic cult of Yahweh grew increasingly militant in its opposition to the worship of other gods.[45] Later, the reforms of King Josiah imposed a form of strict monolatrism. After the fall of Judah to Babylon, a small circle of priests and scribes gathered around the exiled royal court, where they first developed the concept of YHWH as the sole God of the world.[25]\\r\\nShema Yisrael (\\"Hear, [O] Israel\\") are the first two words of a section of the Torah, and is the title of a prayer that serves as a centerpiece of the morning and evening Jewish prayer services. The first verse encapsulates the monotheistic essence of Judaism: \\"Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is one\\" (Hebrew: ?????? ?????????? ?' ?????????? ?' ??????), found in Deuteronomy 6:4, sometimes alternatively translated as \\"The LORD is our God, the LORD alone.\\" Observant Jews consider the Shema to be the most important part of the prayer service in Judaism, and its twice-daily recitation as a mitzvah (religious commandment). It is traditional for Jews to say the Shema as their last words, and for parents to teach their children to say it before they go to sleep at night.\\r\\nAmong early Christians there was considerable debate over the nature of the Godhead, with some denying the incarnation but not the deity of Jesus (Docetism) and others later calling for an Arian conception of God. Despite at least one earlier local synod rejecting the claim of Arius, this Christological issue was to be one of the items addressed at the First Council of Nicaea.\\r\\nThe First Council of Nicaea, held in Nicaea (in present-day Turkey), convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325, was the first ecumenical[49] council of bishops of the Roman Empire, and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian doctrine, called the Nicene Creed. With the creation of the creed, a precedent was established for subsequent general ecumenical councils of bishops (synods) to create statements of belief and canons of doctrinal orthodoxy the intent being to define a common creed for the Church and address heretical ideas.\\r\\nOne purpose of the council was to resolve disagreements in Alexandria over the nature of Jesus in relationship to the Father; in particular, whether Jesus was of the same substance as God the Father or merely of similar substance. All but two bishops took the first position; while Arius' argument failed.\\r\\nChristian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestants) follow this decision, which was reaffirmed in 381 at the First Council of Constantinople and reached its full development through the work of the Cappadocian Fathers. They consider God to be a triune entity, called the Trinity, comprising three \\"persons\\", God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three are described as being \\"of the same substance\\" (???).\\r\\nChristians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the Nicene Creed (and others), which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity, begins: \\"I believe in one God\\". From earlier than the times of the Nicene Creed, 325?CE, various Christian figures advocated[50] the triune mystery-nature of God as a normative profession of faith. According to Roger E. Olson and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded \\"that God must exist as both a unity and trinity\\", codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century.[51]\\r\\nMost modern Christians believe the Godhead is triune, meaning that the three persons of the Trinity are in one union in which each person is also wholly God. They also hold to the doctrine of a man-god Christ Jesus as God incarnate. These Christians also do not believe that one of the three divine figures is God alone and the other two are not but that all three are mysteriously God and one. Other Christian religions, including Unitarian Universalism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism and others, do not share those views on the Trinity.\\r\\nSome Christian faiths, such as Mormonism, argue that the Godhead is in fact three separate individuals which include God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.[52] Each individual having a distinct purpose in the grand existence of human kind.[53] Furthermore, Mormons believe that before the Council of Nicaea, the predominant belief among many early Christians was that the Godhead was three separate individuals. In support of this view, they cite early Christian examples of belief in subordinationism.[54]\\r\\nUnitarianism is a theological movement, named for its understanding of God as one person, in direct contrast to Trinitarianism.[55]\\r\\nIn Islam, Allh (God) is all-powerful and all-knowing, the creator, sustainer, ordainer and judge of the universe.[56][57] God in Islam is strictly singular (tawhid)[58] unique (wahid) and inherently One (ahad), all-merciful and omnipotent.[59] Allh exists without place[60] and the Qur'an states that \\"No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. God is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things\\" (Qur'an 6:103)[57] Allh is the only God and the same God worshiped in Christianity and Judaism. (29:46).[61]\\r\\nIslam emerged in the 7th century CE in the context of both Christianity and Judaism, with some thematic elements similar to Gnosticism.[62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69] Islamic belief states that Muhammad did not bring a new religion from God, but is rather the same religion as practiced by Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus and all the other prophets of God.[70] The assertion of Islam is that the message of God had been corrupted, distorted or lost over time and the Quran was sent to Muhammad in order to correct the lost message of the Torah, New Testament and prior scriptures from God.[71]\\r\\nThe Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the creation.[72] The Qur'an rejects binary modes of thinking such as the idea of a duality of God by arguing that both good and evil generate from God's creative act. God is a universal god rather than a local, tribal or parochial one; an absolute who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil.[73] Ash'ari theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, insists on ultimate divine transcendence and holds that divine unity is not accessible to human reason. Ash'arism teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what was has been revealed through the prophets, and on such paradoxes as God's creation of evil, revelation has to accepted bila kayfa (without [asking] how).[74]\\r\\nTawhid constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession of faith, \\"There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God.[75] To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the Qur'an.[73] The entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of tawhid.[76]\\r\\nAs they traditionally profess a concept of monotheism with a singular person as God, Judaism[42] and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Judaism uses the term Shituf to refer to non-monotheistic ways of worshiping God. Though Muslims venerate Jesus (Isa in Arabic) as a prophet, they do not accept the doctrine that he was a begotten son of God.\\r\\nAccording to the Quran, the Sabians were a monotheistic religious group.[77] Some Hadiths account them as converts to Islam.[78] However this interpretation may be related to the fact that Quraysh polytheists used to describe anyone who converted to Islam with the word \\"Saba\\"[citation needed] (???/????) which may either mean that this term was used for anyone who changed his religion or that they identified the message of Muhammed as a \\"Sabian belief\\". The former linguistic explanation (i.e. saba = changed his religion) is the one adopted by most Muslim scholars.\\r\\nSabians are often identified with Mandaeism, a small monotheistic community which lives today in Iraq and call themselves Yahyawiya (Arabic: ????????). Muslim scholars traditionally viewed them as followers of the prophets Noah and Yahya (i.e. John the Baptist).[79]\\r\\nGod in the Bah' Faith is taught to be a personal god, too great for humans to fully comprehend. Human primitive understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his divine intermediary Manifestations.[80][81] In the Bah' faith, such Christian doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising the Bah' view that God is single and has no equal.[82] And the very existence of the Bah' Faith is a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of the finality of Muhammad's revelation.[83] God in the Bah' Faith communicates to humanity through divine intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God.[84] These Manifestations establish religion in the world.[81] It is through these divine intermediaries that humans can approach God, and through them God brings divine revelation and law.[85]\\r\\nThe Oneness of God is one of the core teachings of the Bah' Faith. The obligatory prayers in the Bah' Faith involve explicit monotheistic testimony.[86][87] God is the imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence.[88] He is described as \\"a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty\\".[89][90] Although transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation. The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator.[91] God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God, who are the prophets and messengers that have founded religions from prehistoric times up to the present day.[84]\\r\\nAmenhotep IV initially introduced Atenism in Year 5 of his reign (1348/1346 BCE) during the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom. He raised Aten, once a relatively obscure Egyptian Solar deity representing the disk of the sun, to the status of Supreme God in the Egyptian pantheon.[92] To emphasise the change, Aten's name was written in the cartouche form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. This religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a Sed festival, a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh's divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh's reign, this possibly was a festival in honour of Amenhotep III, who some Egyptologists think had a coregency with his son Amenhotep IV of two to twelve years.\\r\\nYear 5 is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV's construction of a new capital, Akhetaten (Horizon of the Aten), at the site known today as Amarna. Evidence of this appears on three of the boundary stelae used to mark the boundaries of this new capital. At this time, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten (Agreeable to Aten) as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In Year 7 of his reign (1346/1344 BCE), the capital was moved from Thebes to Akhetaten (near modern Amarna), though construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres Akhenaten was signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political power.\\r\\nThe move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had deeper religious significance tootaken in conjunction with his name change, it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of Akhenaten's symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive temple complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at Karnak and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of Amun.\\r\\nIn Year 9 (1344/1342 BCE), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon, but the only God of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the Great Hymn to the Aten: \\"O Sole God beside whom there is none\\".\\r\\nThe details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but most scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of monolatry rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but Aten. It is known that Atenism did not solely attribute divinity to the Aten. Akhenaten continued the cult of the Pharaoh, proclaiming himself the son of Aten and encouraging the Egyptian people to worship him.[93] The Egyptian people were to worship Akhenaten; only Akhenaten and Nefertiti could worship Aten directly.[94]\\r\\nUnder Akhenaten's successors, Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.\\r\\nThe orthodox faith system held by most dynasties of China since at least the Shang Dynasty (1766?BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of Shangdi (literally \\"Above Sovereign\\", generally translated as \\"God\\") or Heaven as an omnipotent force.[95] This faith system pre-dated the development of Confucianism and Taoism and the introduction of Buddhism and Christianity. It has features of monotheism in that Heaven is seen as an omnipotent entity, a noncorporeal force with a personality transcending the world. From the writings of Confucius in the Analects, it is known Confucius believed that Heaven cannot be deceived, Heaven guides people's lives and maintains a personal relationship with them, and that Heaven gives tasks for people to fulfill in order to teach them of virtues and morality.[95] However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshiped along with Shangdi. Still, later variants such as Mohism (470 BCEÿc.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of Shangdi, akin to angels in Abrahamic religions. In Mozi's Will of Heaven (), he writes:\\r\\nWorship of Shangdi and Heaven in ancient China includes the erection of shrines, the last and greatest being the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, and the offering of prayers. The ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty would perform annual sacrificial rituals to Shangdi, usually by slaughtering a completely healthy bull as sacrifice. Although its popularity gradually diminished after the advent of Taoism and Buddhism, among other religions, its concepts remained in use throughout the pre-modern period and have been incorporated in later religions in China, including terminology used by early Christians in China. Despite the rising of non-theistic and pantheistic spirituality contributed by Taoism and Buddhism, Shangdi was still praised up until the end of the Qing Dynasty as the last ruler of the Qing declared himself son of heaven.\\r\\nThe Himba people of Namibia practice a form of monotheistic panentheism, and worship the god Mukuru. The deceased ancestors of the Himba and Herero are subservient to him, acting as intermediaries.[96]\\r\\nThe Igbo people practice a form of monotheism called Odinani.[97] Odinani has monotheistic and panentheistic attributes, having a single God as the source of all things. Although a pantheon of spirits exists, these are lesser spirits prevalent in Odinani expressly serving as elements of Chineke (or Chukwu), the supreme being or high god.\\r\\nSome (approximately 3%) of Oromo people follow a traditional monotheistic religion called Waaqeffannaa and God called Waaq.\\r\\nThe supreme god of the Proto-Indo-European religion was the god *Dy?us P?at?r . A number of words derived from the name of this supreme deity are used in various Indo-European languages to denote a monotheistic God. Nonetheless, in spite of this, Proto-Indo-European religion itself was not monotheistic.[98]\\r\\nIn western Eurasia, the ancient traditions of the Slavic religion contained elements of monotheism. In the sixth century AD, the Byzantine chronicler Procopius recorded that the Slavs \\"acknowledge that one god, creator of lightning, is the only lord of all: to him do they sacrifice an ox and all sacrificial animals.\\"[99] The deity to whom Procopius is referring is the storm god Per~n, whose name is derived from *Perkwunos, the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning. The ancient Slavs syncretized him with the Germanic god Thor and the Biblical prophet Elijah.[100]\\r\\nAs an old religion, Hinduism inherits religious concepts spanning monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, and atheism among others;[101][102][103][104] and its concept of God is complex and depends upon each individual and the tradition and philosophy followed.\\r\\nHindu views are broad and range from monism, through pantheism and panentheism (alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars) to monotheism and even atheism. Hinduism cannot be said to be purely polytheistic. Hindu religious leaders have repeatedly stressed that while God's forms are many and the ways to communicate with him are many, God is one. The puja of the murti is a way to communicate with the abstract one god (Brahman) which creates, sustains and dissolves creation.[105]\\r\\nRig Veda 1.164.46,\\r\\nTraditions of Gaudiya Vaishnavas, the Nimbarka Sampradaya and followers of Swaminarayan and Vallabha consider Krishna to be the source of all avatars,[106] and the source of Vishnu himself, or to be the same as Narayana. As such, he is therefore regarded as Svayam Bhagavan.[107][108][109]\\r\\nWhen Krishna is recognized to be Svayam Bhagavan, it can be understood that this is the belief of Gaudiya Vaishnavism,[110] the Vallabha Sampradaya,[111] and the Nimbarka Sampradaya, where Krishna is accepted to be the source of all other avatars, and the source of Vishnu himself. This belief is drawn primarily \\"from the famous statement of the Bhagavatam\\"[112] (1.3.28).[113] A viewpoint differing from this theological concept is the concept of Krishna as an avatar of Narayana or Vishnu. It should be however noted that although it is usual to speak of Vishnu as the source of the avataras, this is only one of the names of the God of Vaishnavism, who is also known as Narayana, Vasudeva and Krishna and behind each of those names there is a divine figure with attributed supremacy in Vaishnavism.[114]\\r\\nThe Rig Veda discusses monotheistic thought, as do the Atharva Veda and Yajur Veda: \\"Devas are always looking to the supreme abode of Vishnu\\" (tad vi??o? parama? pada? sad pa?yanti s?raya? Rig Veda 1.22.20)\\r\\n\\"The One Truth, sages know by many names\\" (Rig Veda 1.164.46)[115]\\r\\n\\"When at first the unborn sprung into being, He won His own dominion beyond which nothing higher has been in existence\\" (Atharva Veda 10.7.31)[116]\\r\\n\\"There is none to compare with Him. There is no parallel to Him, whose glory, verily, is great.\\" (Yajur Veda 32.3)[117]\\r\\nThe number of auspicious qualities of God are countless, with the following six qualities (bhaga) being the most important:\\r\\nIn the Shaivite tradition, the Shri Rudram (Sanskrit ???? ???????), to which the Chamakam (?????) is added by scriptural tradition, is a Hindu stotra dedicated to Rudra (an epithet of Shiva), taken from the Yajurveda (TS 4.5, 4.7).[119][120] Shri Rudram is also known as Sri Rudraprasna, ?atarudrؐya, and Rudradhyaya. The text is important in Vedanta where Shiva is equated to the Universal supreme God. The hymn is an early example of enumerating the names of a deity,[121] a tradition developed extensively in the sahasranama literature of Hinduism.\\r\\nThe Nyaya school of Hinduism has made several arguments regarding a monotheistic view. The Naiyanikas have given an argument that such a god can only be one. In the Nyaya Kusumanjali, this is discussed against the proposition of the Mimamsa school that let us assume there were many demigods (devas) and sages (rishis) in the beginning, who wrote the Vedas and created the world. Nyaya says that:\\r\\n[If they assume such] omniscient beings, those endowed with the various superhuman faculties of assuming infinitesimal size, and so on, and capable of creating everything, then we reply that the law of parsimony bids us assume only one such, namely Him, the adorable Lord. There can be no confidence in a non-eternal and non-omniscient being, and hence it follows that according to the system which rejects God, the tradition of the Veda is simultaneously overthrown; there is no other way open.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn other words, Nyaya says that the polytheist would have to give elaborate proofs for the existence and origin of his several celestial spirits, none of which would be logical, and that it is more logical to assume one eternal, omniscient god.[122]\\r\\nSikhi is a monotheistic[123][124] and a revealed religion.[125] God in Sikhi is called Vhigur, and is shapeless, timeless, and sightless: nira?kr, akaal, and alakh. God is present (sarav vipak) in all of creation. God must be seen from \\"the inward eye\\", or the \\"heart\\". Sikhi devotees must meditate to progress towards enlightenment, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.[126]\\r\\nSikhism is a monotheistic faith[127][128] that arose in northern India during the 16th and 17th centuries. Sikhs believe in one, timeless, omnipresent, supreme creator. The opening verse of the Guru Granth Sahib, known as the Mul Mantra, signifies this:\\r\\nThe word \\"?\\" (\\"Ik a?kr\\") has two components. The first is ?, the digit \\"1\\" in Gurmukhi signifying the singularity of the creator. Together the word means: \\"One Universal creator God\\".\\r\\nIt is often said that the 1430 pages of the Guru Granth Sahib are all expansions on the Mul Mantra. Although the Sikhs have many names for God, some derived from Islam and Hinduism, they all refer to the same Supreme Being.\\r\\nThe Sikh holy scriptures refer to the One God who pervades the whole of space and is the creator of all beings in the universe. The following quotation from the Guru Granth Sahib highlights this point:\\r\\n\\"Chant, and meditate on the One God, who permeates and pervades the many beings of the whole Universe. God created it, and God spreads through it everywhere. Everywhere I look, I see God. The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; there is no place without Him.\\"\\r\\nHowever, there is a strong case for arguing that the Guru Granth Sahib teaches monism due to its non-dualistic tendencies:\\r\\nPunjabi: ??? ?? ???? ?? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ???? ???\\r\\nSikhs believe that God has been given many names, but they all refer to the One God, VhiGur. Sikhs believe that members of other religions such as Islam, Hinduism and Christianity all worship the same God, and the names Allah, Rahim, Karim, Hari, Raam and Paarbrahm are frequently mentioned in the Sikh holy scriptures. Although there is no set reference to God in Sikhism, the most commonly used Sikh reference to God is Akal Purakh (which means \\"the true immortal\\") or Waheguru, the Primal Being.\\r\\nZoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism which makes it unique among the religions of the world. Zoroastrianism proclaims an evolution through time from dualism to monotheism.[129]\\r\\nZoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion,[130] although Zoroastrianism is often regarded[131] as dualistic, duotheistic or bitheistic, for its belief in the hypostatis of the ultimately good Ahura Mazda (creative spirit) and the ultimately evil Angra Mainyu (destructive spirit). Zorastrianism was once one of the largest religions on Earth, as the official religion of the Persian Empire. By some scholars,[who?] the Zoroastrians (\\"Parsis\\" or \\"Zartoshtis\\") are credited with being some of the first monotheists and having had influence on other world religions. Gathered statistics shows the number of adherents at as many as 3.5 million,[132] with adherents living in many regions, including South Asia.\\r\\nThe surviving fragments of the poems of the classical Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon suggest that he held views very similar to those of modern monotheists.[133] His poems harshly criticize the traditional notion of anthropomorphic gods, commenting that \\"...if cattle and horses and lions had hands or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do,... [they] also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies of such a sort as the form they themselves have.\\"[134] Instead, Xenophanes declares that there is \\"...one god, greatest among gods and humans, like mortals neither in form nor in thought.\\"[135] Xenophanes's theology appears to have been monist, but not truly monotheistic in the strictest sense.[25] Although some later philosophers, such as Antisthenes, believed in doctrines similar to those expounded by Xenophanes, his ideas do not appear to have become widely popular.[25]\\r\\nAlthough Plato himself was a polytheist, in his writings, he often presents Socrates as speaking of \\"the god\\" in the singular form. He does, however, often speak of the gods in the plural form as well. The Euthyphro dilemma, for example, is formulated as \\"Is that which is holy loved by the gods because it is holy, or is it holy because it is loved by the gods?\\"[136]\\r\\nThe development of pure (philosophical) monotheism is a product of the Late Antiquity. During the 2nd to 3rd centuries, early Christianity was just one of several competing religious movements advocating monotheism.\\r\\n\\"The One\\" (? ?) is a concept that is prominent in the writings of the Neoplatonists, especially those of the philosopher Plotinus.[137] In the writings of Plotinus, \\"The One\\" is described as an inconceivable, transcendent, all-embodying, permanent, eternal, causative entity that permeates throughout all of existence.[138]\\r\\nA number of oracles of Apollo from Didyma and Clarus, the so-called \\"theological oracles\\", dated to the 2nd and 3rd century CE, proclaim that there is only one highest god, of whom the gods of polytheistic religions are mere manifestations or servants.[139] 4th century CE Cyprus had, besides Christianity, an apparently monotheistic cult of Dionysus.[140]\\r\\nAristotle's concept of the \\"Uncaused Cause\\"never incorporated into the polytheistic ancient Greek religionhas been used by many exponents of Abrahamic religions to justify their arguments for the existence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God of the Abrahamic religions.\\r\\nThe Hypsistarians were a religious group who believed in a most high god, according to Greek documents. Later revisions of this Hellenic religion were adjusted towards Monotheism as it gained consideration among a wider populace.

Historically, it was the prevailing religion of the Bulgarians, Turks, Mongols, and Hungarians, as well as the Xiongnu and the Huns.[146][147] It was the state religion of the six ancient Turkic states: Avar Khaganate, Old Great Bulgaria, First Bulgarian Empire, G?ktrks Khaganate, Eastern Tourkia and Western Turkic Khaganate. In Irk Bitig, Tengri is mentioned as Trk T?ngrisi (God of Turks).[148] The term is perceived among Turkic peoples as a national religion.\\r\\nIn Sino-Tibetan and Turco-Mongol traditions, the Supreme God is commonly referred to as the ruler of Heaven, or the Sky Lord granted with omnipotent powers, but it has largely diminished in those regions due to ancestor worship, Taoism's pantheistic views and Buddhism's rejection of a creator God, although Mahayana Buddhism does seem to keep a sense of divinity. On some occasions in the mythology, the Sky Lord as identified as a male has been associated to mate with an Earth Mother, while some traditions kept the omnipotence of the Sky Lord unshared.\\r\\nNative American theology may be monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, or some combination thereof.\\r\\nCherokee for example are monotheist as well as pantheist.\\r\\nThe Great Spirit, called Wakan Tanka among the Sioux,[149] and Gitche Manitou in Algonquian, is a conception of universal spiritual force, or supreme being prevalent among some Native American and First Nation cultures.[150] According to Lakota activist Russell Means a better translation of Wakan Tanka is the Great Mystery.[151]\\r\\nHence all the power of magic became dissolved; and every bond of wickedness was destroyed, men's ignorance was taken away, and the old kingdom abolished God Himself appearing in the form of a man, for the renewal of eternal life.\\r\\nWe have also as a Physician the Lord our God Jesus the Christ the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began, but who afterwards became also man, of Mary the virgin.

As one approaches on the left (toward the Pacific arch), the scenes begin with soon-to-be servicemen getting physical exams, taking the oath, and being issued military gear. The reliefs progress through several iconic scenes, including combat and burying the dead, ending in a homecoming scene. On the right-side wall (toward the Atlantic arch) there is a similar progression, but with scenes generally more typical of the European theatre.

Kaptur introduced the World War II Memorial Act to the House of Representatives as HR 3742 on December 10. The resolution authorized the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) to establish a World War II memorial in \\"Washington, D.C., or its environs\\", but the bill was not voted on before the end of the session, so it was not passed. Two more times, in 1989 and 1991, Rep. Kaptur introduced similar legislation, but these bills suffered the same fate as the first, and did not become law.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaptur reintroduced legislation in the House a fourth time as HR 682 on January 27, 1993, one day after Senator Strom Thurmond (a Republican from South Carolina) introduced companion Senate legislation. On March 17, 1993, the Senate approved the act, and the House approved an amended version of the bill on May 4. On May 12, the Senate also approved the amended bill, and the World War II Memorial Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on May 25 of that year, becoming Public Law 103-32.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 30, 1994, President Bill Clinton appointed a 12-member Memorial Advisory Board (MAB) to advise the ABMC in picking the site, designing the memorial, and raising money to build it. A direct mail fundraising effort brought in millions of dollars from individual Americans. Additional large donations were made by veterans' groups, including the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge and others. The majority of the corporate fundraising effort was led by two co-chairs: Senator Bob Dole, a decorated World War II veteran and 1996 Republican nominee for president; and Frederick W. Smith, the president and chief executive officer of FedEx Corporation and a former U.S. Marine Corps officer. The U.S. federal government provided about $16 million. A total of $197 million was raised.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 20, 1995, Colonel Kevin C. Kelley, project manager for the ABMC, organized the first meeting of the ABMC and the MAB, at which the project was discussed and initial plans made. The meeting was chaired by Commissioner F. Haydn Williams, chairman of ABMC's World War II Memorial Site and Design Committee, who would go on to guide the project through the site selection and approval process and the selection and approval of the Memorial's design. Representatives from the United States Commission of Fine Arts, the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Capital Memorial Commission, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Park Service attended the meeting. Selection of an appropriate site was taken on as the first action.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next months, several sites were considered. Three quickly gained favor:[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther sites considered but quickly rejected were:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe selection of the Rainbow Pool site was announced on October 5, 1995. The design would incorporate the Rainbow Pool fountain, located across 17th Street from the Washington Monument and near the Constitution Gardens site.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is itself a significant symbol. The memorial will be given a more prominent spot than any monument on the National Mall since the Lincoln Memorial opened in 1922. The location, between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, represents the first addition in more than 70 years to the grand corridor of open space that stretches from the Capitol 2.1 miles west to the Potomac River.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nA nationwide design competition drew 400 submissions from architects from around the country. Friedrich St. Florian's initial design was selected in 1997. Over the next four years, St. Florian's design was altered during the review and approval process required of proposed memorials in Washington, D.C. Ambassador Haydn Williams guided the design development for ABMC.\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Florian's design consists of an architectural sculpture that evokes a classical monument.  The two memorial arches, Pacific and Atlantic baldacchinos each have laurel wreaths suspended in the air with 4 eagles carrying it. The chandelier sculpture symbolizes the victory of the War with the Nation's bird carrying a Grecian symbol of victory but with an American adaptation of oak laurel wreaths to symbolize strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of the 56 pillars all consists of oak laurel wreaths and wheat laurel wreath. The oak symbolizes military and industrial strength and the wheat symbolizes agricultural and breadbasket during the U.S. part in the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nGround was broken in September 2001. The construction was managed by the General Services Administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe triumphal arches were crafted by Rock of Ages Corporation. Sculptor Raymond Kaskey created the bronze eagles and wreaths that were installed under the arches, as well as 24 bronze bas-relief panels that depict wartime scenes of combat and the home front.[13] The bronzes were cast over the course of two and a half years at Laran Bronze in Chester, Pennsylvania.[14] The stainless-steel armature that holds up the eagles and wreaths was designed at Laran, in part by sculptor James Peniston,[15] and fabricated by Apex Piping of Newport, Delaware.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe John Stevens Shop designed the lettering for the memorial and most of the inscriptions were hand-carved in situ.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe memorial opened to the public on April 29, 2004, and was dedicated in a May 29 ceremony attended by thousands of people. The memorial became a national park on November 1, when authority over it was transferred to the National Park Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the memorial's fountain was renovated.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics such as the National Coalition to Save Our Mall opposed the location of the memorial. A major criticism of the location was that it would interrupt what had been an unbroken view between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. The memorial was also criticized for taking up open space that had been historically used for major demonstrations and protests.[18][19][20]\\r\\nCritics were particularly bothered by the expedited approval process, which is considerably lengthy most of the time.[21] The United States Congress, worried that World War II veterans were dying before an appropriate memorial could be built, passed legislation exempting the World War II Memorial from further site and design review. Congress also dismissed pending legal challenges to the memorial.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were also aesthetic objections to the design. A critic from the Boston Herald described the monument as \\"vainglorious, demanding of attention and full of trite imagery.\\"[23]\\r\\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer argued that \\"this pompous style was also favored by Hitler and Mussolini\\"[24] (see Nazi architecture).

It is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid that acts as a central nervous system depressant.[1] Ethanol can impair different types of memory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlcohol acts as a general central nervous system depressant, but it also affects specific areas of the brain to a greater extent than others. Memory impairment due to alcohol has been linked to disruption of hippocampal functionin particular affecting gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotransmission which negatively impacts long-term potentiation (LTP).[2] The molecular basis of LTP is associated with learning and memory.[3] Particularly, damage to hippocampal CA1 cells adversely affects memory formation,[4] and this disruption has been linked to dose-dependent levels of alcohol consumption.[5] At higher doses, alcohol significantly inhibits neuronal activity in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus.[6][7][8] This impairs memory encoding[9] since the hippocampus plays an important role in the formation of new memories.\\r\\nAlcohol acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA receptors, specifically type GABAA.[10] Upon activation, these GABA receptors conduct Cl-, resulting in neuronal hyperpolarization. This hyperpolarization decreases the chance of an action potential occurring and, thus, has an inhibitory effect on neurotransmission in the central nervous system. GABAA receptor subtypes vary in their sensitivity to dosage of alcohol consumed. Furthermore, acute alcohol intake promotes GABAergic neurotransmission via presynaptic release of GABA, dephosphorylation of GABAA receptors (increasing GABA sensitivity), and elevation of endogenous GABAergic neuroactive steroids.[11] Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in differentially modulating the response of the GABAA receptor to alcohol, with effects depending on the PKC isozyme.[12] Alcohol effects have also implicated protein kinase A in affecting GABAA receptor function, such as promoting sensitivity.[13] Enhancement of GABAergic transmission due to alcohol consumption can also be brought about by neuroactive steroids, such as allopregnanolone, which act as GABAA receptor agonists.[11][14] Chronic alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence are correlated with altered expression, properties, and functions of the GABAA receptor that may contribute to alcohol tolerance.[11] There is still much to be discovered about alcohols specific and varying effects on the GABAA receptor and its subtypes.\\r\\nAt higher doses, ethanol also affects NMDA receptors (NMDARs) by inhibiting the ion current induced by NMDA, a glutamate receptor agonist.[15] This inhibition of synaptic excitation by alcohol has been shown to be dose-dependent (up to a certain point, after which it did not differ by much).[16] Alcohol appears to produce this inhibition by using a site of the NMDAR that is accessible from the extracellular environment.[17] Thusly, this inhibition of an ion current usually produced by NMDAR activation leads to decreased LTP in hippocampal areas.[18] Alcohol negatively affects LTP to a greater degree in immature versus mature animals.[19] In adolescents, alcohol decreases the expression of the NMDAR NR2A subunit in the hippocampus and the NR1 subunit in the prefrontal cortex.[20] Studies have also found a decrease in phosphorylation of 2B subunit in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and striatum.[21] NMDARS may be affected by PKA regulation due to the actions of alcohol.[22] Alcohols effects on GABAA neurotransmission may indirectly inhibit the activity of the NMDAR and contribute to its blockade of LTP induction; however, alcohols direct effects on NMDAR alone are sufficient for the inhibition of LTP.[23] The varying dose-dependent response to alcohol relies on the combined interactions and responses of the GABAA receptors, NMDARs, and metabotropic glutamate receptors subtype 5 (mGluR5).[24][25][26] These changes prevent excitatory synaptic transmissions from occurring, affecting synaptic plasticity and, in turn, memory and learning. However, there is still much to be elucidated concerning specific molecular mechanisms of how alcohol affects memory formation.\\r\\nAlcohol also impairs and alters functioning in the cerebellum, which affects motor function and coordination.[27] It has a notable inhibitory effect on neurons of the cerebral cortex, affecting and altering thought processes, decreasing inhibition, and increasing the pain threshold. It also decreases sexual performance by depressing nerve centers in the hypothalamus.[28][29] Alcohol also has an effect on urine excretion via inhibition of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) secretion of the pituitary gland. Lastly, it depresses breathing and heart rate by inhibiting neuronal functioning of the medulla.[30]\\r\\nLong-term memory (LTM) has a long duration and large capacity.[31] Memories stored in LTM can last from a few days to a lifetime.[31] LTM consists of explicit memory (requiring conscious awareness) and implicit memory (unconscious awareness).[31] Information selected for LTM goes through three processes. First, in the encoding stage, information from the senses is incorporated into mental activity in the form of a memory.[31] Secondly, storage involves taking this information and holding it indefinitely in memory.[31] Lastly, retrieval is the ability to recall information from the long-term memory storage. Each of these processes can be affected by alcohol.[31]\\r\\nExplicit memory requires conscious and intentional effort for recall.[31] It includes both episodic memory (for specific events, such as a party) and semantic memory (for general information, such as one's name).[31]\\r\\nAlcohol impairs episodic encoding, specifically for cued recall, recognition of completed word fragments, and free recall.[32] A blackout is an example of a difficulty in encoding episodic memories due to alcohol. Blackouts are caused by a rapid increase in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) which in turn distorts the neurons in the hippocampus.[33] This distortion impairs a person's ability to form new episodic memories.[33]\\r\\nHigh doses of alcohol severely disrupt the storage process of semantic memories.[34] Alcohol was found to impair the storage of novel stimuli but not that of previously learned information.[34] Since alcohol affects the central nervous system, it hinders semantic storage functioning by restricting the consolidation of the information from encoding.[34]\\r\\nRetrieval of explicit memory is significantly impaired by alcohol. When compared to sober participants, intoxicated participants performed quite poorly on a recall task for everyday events (episodic memory).[35] Intoxicated participants are also slower to respond in reaction time tasks.[36] Alcohol also impairs retrieval in word recognition tasks.[32] When both encoding and retrieval take place during intoxication, there are surprisingly more impairments for cued recall than for free recall.[32] In terms of gender differences in retrieval processes, females tend to score lower than males on recall tasks when intoxicated.[36]\\r\\nImplicit memory does not require conscious effort or intention for recall.[31] It occurs when previous experience influences performance on a certain task.[31] This is evident in priming experiments. Implicit memory includes procedural memory, which influences our everyday behaviours, such as riding a bike or tying shoes.[31] People can perform these abilities without thinking about them, which means procedural memory functions automatically. While retrieval of explicit memory is severely impaired by alcohol, retrieval of implicit memory is not.[35] Intoxicated subjects score higher on recognition tasks (involving implicit memory) than on recall tasks (involving explicit memory).[35]\\r\\nShort-term memory refers to temporary storage of small amounts of information over short delays.[31] Digit span refers to the proposed number of pieces of information (5-9) that can be held in short-term memory. This is also referred to as the magic number seven?ÿ plus or minus two. Any more pieces of information than this, and newer items replace previous items.[37] Alcohol intoxication has been found to have dissociative effects on short-term memory and cognitive functioning.[38][39]\\r\\nAlcohol affects brain functioning. Neurochemical changes occurring in the anterior cingulate are correlated with altered short-term memory functions in the brains of young alcoholic men.[40] fMRIs of alcohol-dependent women displayed significantly less blood oxygen in the frontal and parietal regions, especially in the right hemisphere.[41] This is supported by findings of short-term memory impairment by lesions of the parietal lobe[42] and prefrontal cortex.[43] Associations between Third ventricle volume and cognitive performance on memory tests have been found in alcoholics.[44] Specifically, increases in third ventricular volume correlate with a decline in memory performance.[44]\\r\\nShort-term memory is commonly tested with visual tasks. Short-term memory, especially for non-verbal and spatial material, are impaired by intoxication.[44] Alcohol decreases iconic memory (a type of visual short-term memory).[45] With BACs between 80ÿ84?mg/dl, more intrusion errors occur in a delayed recall task compared to a control group.[46] Intrusion errors, which represent reflective cognitive functioning, occur when irrelevant information is produced. Alcoholics have less control of inhibiting intrusions.[46] Acute alcohol intoxication in social drinkers caused more intrusion errors in delayed recall tasks than in immediate free recall tasks.[46] Acute alcohol intoxication increases susceptibility to interference, which allows for more intrusion errors when there is a short delay.[46] Free recall (given list of words then asked to recall list) is significantly lower and therefore impaired by alcohol intoxication.[47][48] Encoding deficits were found in verbal free recall and recognition tasks under the influence of alcohol.[49] A discrimination task found significant alcohol-related impairments in depth perception and in visual short-term memory.[50] State-dependent learning and relearning studies in male heavy drinkers demonstrate that the condition of intoxication while learning and sobriety when tested caused a performance deficit in free recall tasks.[51] These findings are supportive of alcohol-induced storage deficits (not retrieval deficits).[51] The effects of acute alcohol consumption on visual short-term memory, stereoscopic depth perception, and attention were studied. A 33% alcohol condition showed significant impairments in depth perception and in visual short-term memory (assessed by the vernier discrimination task).[52]\\r\\nWorking memory allows one to keep things in mind while simultaneously performing complex tasks.[31] It involves a system for the temporary storage and manipulation of information, forming a crucial link between perception and controlled action.[53] Evidence suggests that working memory involves three components: the central executive which controls attention, the visuo-spatial sketchpad which holds and manipulates spatial information, and the phonological loop which performs a similar function for auditory and speech-based information.[53]\\r\\nAlcohol consumption has substantial, measurable effects on working memory, though these effects vary greatly between individual responses. Little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie these individual differences.[54] It is also found that alcohol impairs working memory by affecting mnemonic strategies and executive processes rather than by shrinking the basic holding capacity of working memory. Isolated acute-moderate levels of alcohol intoxication do not profoundly physically alter the structures which are critical for working memory function, such as the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate, and parts of the basal ganglia.[38] One finding regarding the effects of alcohol on working memory points out that alcohol reduces working memory only in individuals with a high baseline working memory capacity,[55] which suggests that alcohol might not uniformly affect working memory in different individuals. Alcohol appears to impair the capacity of working memory to modulate response inhibition.[55] Alcohol disinhibits behaviour, but only in individuals with a low baseline working memory capacity.[55] An interesting finding is that incentive to perform well with working memory measurement tasks while under the influence of alcohol 'does in fact have some effect on working memory, in that it boosts scores in rate of mental scanning and reaction time to stimulus, but did not reduce number of errors compared to subjects with no incentive to perform well.[56] Even acute alcohol intoxication (a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08-0.09%) produces a substantial impairment of working memory processes that require mnemonic rehearsal strategies.[38] Alcohol is less likely to impair a working memory task that does not rely on memory rehearsal or associated mnemonic strategies.[38] Because of this, working memory is very susceptible to falter when a person is participating in tasks involving retention concerning auditory and visual sequences.[38] A real world and interesting example of this is failure of guitarists or other musicians performing concerts to cue in on auditory patterns and make it known that their performance is hindered by intoxication, whereas professional basketball (a less sequence-heavy activity for working memory) standout Ron Artest recently admitted in an interview with Sporting News to drinking heavily during half-time in the early days of his career and it having little if any recognizable effect on his working memory. His former coach Fran Fraschilla has gone on record saying:[citation needed]\\r\\n\\"It's a surprise because every day at practice, he came out in a mood to play. He came out in a basketball rage. He was fully committed; he wanted to let our upperclassmen know that he was the alpha male. It never came up that he had any sort of a problem with alcohol. This is the first I've heard of it.\\"\\r\\nAlcohol has shown to have some long-term effect on working memory. Findings have shown that for working memory to be substantially affected, long-term, heavy drinking must be sustained over a long period of time as up to one drink per day does not impair cognitive function and may actually decrease the risk of cognitive decline.[57] Furthermore, chronic alcoholism is associated with impairment in sustained attention and visual working memory. Thus, alcoholics have reduced ability, but not necessarily inability, to perform these executive tasks, assumed to be subserved by regions of prefrontal cortex.[58] While it may not serve as a surprise that chronic alcoholism has been linked to decreased cognitive function including working memory, one surprising finding is not only that even moderate levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were shown to have an adverse effect on the child's working memory when tested at 7.5 years of age, but that working memory may be the most important aspect of attention that is adversely affected by prenatal alcohol exposure.[59]\\r\\nProspective memory involves remembering to carry out an intended action in the future without an explicit reminder.[31] Alcohol has been found to impair this ability. Chronic heavy alcohol users report significantly more prospective forgetting compared to low-dose and alcohol-free controls.[60] The Prospective Memory Questionnaire assesses short-term habitual prospective memory, long-term episodic prospective memory, and internally cued prospective memory.[60] Chronic heavy alcohol users reported significantly greater deficits for all three aspects of prospective memory.[60] Individuals that report heavy alcohol use report 24% more difficulties with prospective memory than those who report that they are light drinkers and 30% more difficulties than those who report that they never drink.[61] The effects of alcohol on prospective memory can also be assessed in the laboratory by simulating prospective memory tasks that individuals face in everyday life. Individuals who are given 0.6 g/kg alcohol prior to performing prospective memory tasks do significantly poorer than a placebo group.[62] Alcohol can damage the prefrontal and frontal areas of the brain, and this may be responsible for prospective memory impairments since prospective memory performance is highly correlated with frontal executive functions.[60]\\r\\nThe memory inhibiting effects of alcohol are often a prominent topic in popular culture. It appears in movies, books, and television shows. Several movies show characters drinking alcohol to the point of memory loss and awakening the next morning with a host of problems due to actions they performed while intoxicated.\\r\\nOne example is The Hangover, where three groomsmen lose the groom during a bachelor party in Las Vegas, so they retrace their steps to find him.[63] The characters still had functioning implicit/procedural memory, which allowed them to carry out the many acts they performed that night, but their episodic memory was impaired and thus they had no recollection of the events occurring. In addition to alcohol the characters were also under the influence of flunitrazepam.\\r\\nAnother movie is What Happens in Vegas. After an intoxicated night in \\"Sin City,\\" two people wake-up to find they got married.[64]\\r\\nSongs such as Waking Up in Vegas by Katy Perry[65] and Last Name by Carrie Underwood[66] also depict characters waking up and not remembering the night before due to alcohol consumption.\\r\\nBy some accounts, popular culture makes light of the memory problems that can result from alcohol consumption.\\r\\nThe court case R. v. Daviault [1994] concerned the viability of a legal defense based on intoxication.\\r\\nLaw and Order: Special Victims Unit; in season 11 episode 4, Hammered, a recovering alcoholic was coersed to drink by a business partner and later wakes up to a dead woman in his bed.","input":"What part of the brain is memory affected by alcohol?"},{"output":"March 30, 1867","context":"","input":"When did alaska become part of the us?"},{"output":"Arsenal Tech","context":"Trey Anthony Lyles (born November 5, 1995) is a Canadian-American professional basketball player for the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families.[1][2] They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.\\r\\nSome species including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.\\r\\nBees range in size from tiny stingless bee species whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08?in) long, to Megachile pluto, the largest species of leafcutter bee, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54?in). The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae, or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies.\\r\\nHuman beekeeping or apiculture has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, royal jelly and propolis. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere, where beekeeping is far more common.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancestors of bees were wasps in the family Crabronidae, which were predators of other insects. The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. This same evolutionary scenario may have occurred within the vespoid wasps, where the pollen wasps evolved from predatory ancestors. Until recently, the oldest non-compression bee fossil had been found in New Jersey amber, Cretotrigona prisca of Cretaceous age, a corbiculate bee.[3] A bee fossil from the early Cretaceous (~100 mya), Melittosphex burmensis, is considered \\"an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea sister to the modern bees\\".[4] Derived features of its morphology (apomorphies) place it clearly within the bees, but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits (plesiomorphies) of the legs (two mid-tibial spurs, and a slender hind basitarsus), showing its transitional status.[4] By the Eocene (~45 mya) there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages.[5][a]\\r\\nThe highly eusocial corbiculate Apidae appeared roughly 87 Mya, and the Allodapini (within the Apidae) around 53 Mya.[8] The Colletidae appear as fossils only from the late Oligocene (~25 Mya) to early Miocene.[9] The Melittidae are known from Palaeomacropis eocenicus in the Early Eocene.[10] The Megachilidae are known from trace fossils (characteristic leaf cuttings) from the Middle Eocene.[11] The Andrenidae are known from the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, around 34 Mya, of the Florissant shale.[12] The Halictidae first appear in the Early Eocene[13] with species [14][15] found in amber. The Stenotritidae are known from fossil brood cells of Pleistocene age.[16]\\r\\nThe earliest animal-pollinated flowers were shallow, cup-shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before the first appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of coevolution, flowers developed floral rewards[17] such as nectar and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar.[18] Bees also developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most bees have scopal hairs located on their hind legs or on the underside of their abdomens, some bees in the family Apidae possess pollen baskets on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops.[2] This drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms, and, in turn, the bees themselves.[6] Bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites. Some bees provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this case may be mutualistc.[19][20]\\r\\nThis cladogram is based on Debevic et al, 2012, which used molecular phylogeny to demonstrate that the bees (Anthophila) arose from deep within the Crabronidae, which is therefore paraphyletic. The placement of the Heterogynaidae is uncertain.[21] The small subfamily Mellininae was not included in their analysis.\\r\\nAmpulicidae\\r\\nHeterogynaidae (possible placement #1)\\r\\nSphecidae (sensu stricto)\\r\\nCrabroninae (part of \\"Crabronidae\\")\\r\\nBembicini\\r\\nNyssonini, Astatinae\\r\\nHeterogynaidae (possible placement #2)\\r\\nPemphredoninae, Philanthinae\\r\\nAnthophila (bees)\\r\\nThis cladogram of the bee families is based on Hedtke et al., 2013, which places the former families Dasypodaidae and Meganomiidae as subfamilies inside the Melittidae.[22] English names, where available, are given in parentheses.\\r\\nMelittidae (inc.

They differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae (bristles), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences in the limb structure and the venation of the hind wings, and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.[23]\\r\\nBehaviourally, one of the most obvious characteristics of bees is that they collect pollen to provide provisions for their young, and have the necessary adaptations to do this. However, certain wasp species such as pollen wasps have similar behaviours, and a few species of bee scavenge from carcases to feed their offspring.[23] The world's largest species of bee is thought to be the Indonesian resin bee Megachile pluto, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54?in).[24] The smallest species may be dwarf stingless bees in the tribe Meliponini whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08?in) in length.[25]\\r\\nA bee has a pair of large compound eyes which cover much of the surface of the head. Between and above these are three small simple eyes (ocelli) which provide information for the bee on light intensity. The antennae usually have thirteen segments in males and twelve in females and are geniculate, having an elbow joint part way along. They house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch (mechanoreceptors), smell and taste, and small, hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so as to \\"hear\\" sounds. The mouthparts are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of mandibles and a long proboscis for sucking up nectar.[26]\\r\\nThe thorax has three segments, each with a pair of robust legs, and a pair of membranous wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing. The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.[26]\\r\\nAccording to inclusive fitness theory, organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, but also that of close relatives. In evolutionary terms, individuals should help relatives when Cost < Relatedness * Benefit. The requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure.[27] In haplodiploid species, females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs. Because a male is haploid (has only one copy of each gene), his daughters (which are diploid, with two copies of each gene) share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's. Therefore, they share 75% of their genes with each other. This mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what W. D. Hamilton termed \\"supersisters\\", more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring.[28] Workers often do not reproduce, but they can pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters (as queens) than they would by having their own offspring (each of which would only have 50% of their genes), assuming they would produce similar numbers. This unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality (arising at least nine separate times) within the Hymenoptera.[29][30] However, some eusocial species such as termites are not haplodiploid. Conversely, all bees are haplodiploid but not all are eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, creating half-sisters that share only 25% of their genes.[31] Haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality. But, monogamy (queens mating singly) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated, so it is likely that haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees.[29]\\r\\nBees may be solitary or may live in various types of communities. Sociality, of several different types, appears to have evolved independently many times within the bees.[32] The most advanced of these are species with eusocial colonies; these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive adults, plus overlapping generations.[33] This division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called castes. In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, and if there is a division of labour within the group, they are considered semisocial. The group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the queen) and her daughters (workers). When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, with no morphological differentiation other than size, the system is considered primitively eusocial, as in many paper wasps; when the castes are morphologically discrete, the system is considered highly eusocial.[18]\\r\\nThe true honey bees (genus Apis, of which there are seven currently-recognized species) are highly eusocial, and are among the best known of all insects. Their colonies are established by swarms, consisting of a queen and several hundred workers. There are 29 subspecies of one of these species, Apis mellifera, native to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Africanized bees are a hybrid strain of A. mellifera that escaped from experiments involving crossing European and African subspecies; they are extremely defensive.[34]\\r\\nStingless bees are also highly eusocial. They practise mass provisioning, with complex nest architecture and perennial colonies also established via swarming.[35]\\r\\nMany bumblebees are eusocial, similar to the eusocial Vespidae such as hornets in that the queen initiates a nest on her own rather than by swarming. Bumblebee colonies typically have from 50 to 200 bees at peak population, which occurs in mid to late summer. Nest architecture is simple, limited by the size of the pre-existing nest cavity, and colonies rarely last more than a year.[36] In 2011, the International Union for Conservation of Nature set up the Bumblebee Specialist Group to review the threat status of all bumblebee species worldwide using the IUCN Red List criteria.[37]\\r\\nThere are many more species of primitively eusocial than highly eusocial bees, but they have been studied less often. Most are in the family Halictidae, or \\"sweat bees\\". Colonies are typically small, with a dozen or fewer workers, on average. Queens and workers differ only in size, if at all. Most species have a single season colony cycle, even in the tropics, and only mated females hibernate. A few species have long active seasons and attain colony sizes in the hundreds, such as Halictus hesperus.[38] Some species are eusocial in parts of their range and solitary in others,[39] or have a mix of eusocial and solitary nests in the same population.[40] The orchid bees (Apidae) include some primitively eusocial species with similar biology. Some allodapine bees (Apidae) form primitively eusocial colonies, with progressive provisioning: a larva's food is supplied gradually as it develops, as is the case in honey bees and some bumblebees.[41]\\r\\nMost other bees, including familiar insects such as carpenter bees, leafcutter bees and mason bees are solitary in the sense that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself. There is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and worker bees for these species. Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor beeswax.[42]\\r\\nSolitary bees are important pollinators; they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood. Often it is mixed with nectar to form a paste-like consistency. Some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. A very few species of solitary bees are being cultured for commercial pollination. Most of these species belong to a distinct set of genera which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences, namely: carpenter bees, sweat bees, mason bees, polyester bees, squash bees, dwarf carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, alkali bees and digger bees.[43]\\r\\nMost solitary bees nest in the ground in a variety of soil textures and conditions while others create nests in hollow reeds or twigs, holes in wood. The female typically creates a compartment (a \\"cell\\") with an egg and some provisions for the resulting larva, then seals it off. A nest may consist of numerous cells. When the nest is in wood, usually the last (those closer to the entrance) contain eggs that will become males. The adult does not provide care for the brood once the egg is laid, and usually dies after making one or more nests. The males typically emerge first and are ready for mating when the females emerge. Solitary bees are either stingless or very unlikely to sting (only in self-defense, if ever).[44][45]\\r\\nWhile solitary females each make individual nests, some species. such as the European mason bee Hoplitis anthocopoides,[46] and the Dawson's Burrowing bee, Amegilla dawsoni,[47] are gregarious, preferring to make nests near others of the same species, and giving the appearance of being social. Large groups of solitary bee nests are called aggregations, to distinguish them from colonies. In some species, multiple females share a common nest, but each makes and provisions her own cells independently. This type of group is called \\"communal\\" and is not uncommon. The primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when there are multiple females using that same entrance on a regular basis.[46]\\r\\nThe life cycle of a bee, be it a solitary or social species, involves the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless larva, a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis, followed by the emergence of a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage.[48][49][50][51]\\r\\nThe egg is generally oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end. In the case of solitary bees, each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. This may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning. In social species of bee there is progressive provisioning with the larva being fed regularly while it grows. The nest varies from a hole in the ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.[52]\\r\\nThe larvae are generally whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but are able to move within the confines of the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.[52]\\r\\nIn Antoine Magnan's 1934 book Le vol des insectes, he wrote that he and Andr Sainte-Lagu? had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found that their flight could not be explained by fixed-wing calculations, but that \\"One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality\\".[53] This has led to a common misconception that bees \\"violate aerodynamic theory\\", but in fact it merely confirms that bees do not engage in fixed-wing flight, and that their flight is explained by other mechanics, such as those used by helicopters.[54] In 1996 it was shown that vortices created by many insects' wings helped to provide lift.[55] High-speed cinematography[56] and robotic mock-up of a bee wing[57] showed that lift was generated by \\"the unconventional combination of short, choppy wing strokes, a rapid rotation of the wing as it flops over and reverses direction, and a very fast wing-beat frequency\\". Wing-beat frequency normally increases as size decreases, but as the bee's wing beat covers such a small arc, it flaps approximately 230 times per second, faster than a fruitfly (200 times per second) which is 80 times smaller.[58]\\r\\nThe ethologist Karl von Frisch studied navigation in the honey bee. He showed that honey bees communicate by the waggle dance, in which a worker indicates the location of a food source to other workers in the hive. He demonstrated that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earths magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive.[59] Bees navigate using spatial memory with a \\"rich, map-like organization\\".[60]\\r\\nMost bees are polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect pollen from a range of flowering plants, however, some are oligoleges (specialists), in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants.[61] Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from orchids (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). Bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors,[62] and even electromagnetic fields.[63] Once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality[62] and pollen taste[64] to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers.\\r\\nIn rare cases, a plant species may only be effectively pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are endangered at least in part because their pollinator is also threatened. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators. There are some forty oligoleges associated with the creosote bush in the arid parts of the United States southwest, for example.[65]\\r\\nMany bees are aposematically coloured, typically orange and black, warning of their ability to defend themselves with a powerful sting. As such they are models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects such as bee-flies, robber flies and hoverflies,[66] all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees.[66]\\r\\nBees are themselves Mllerian mimics of other aposematic insects with the same colour scheme, including wasps, lycid and other beetles, and many butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) which are themselves distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food. All the Mllerian mimics, including bees, benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration.[67]\\r\\nBees are also mimicked by plants such as the bee orchid which imitates both the appearance and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt to mate (pseudocopulation) with the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.[68]\\r\\nBrood parasites occur in several bee families including the apid subfamily Nomadinae.[69] Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) and do not construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and often the host egg also.[70] The Arctic bee species, Bombus hyperboreus, in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, unlike many other bee brood parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.[71]\\r\\nIn the south of Africa, hives of African honeybees (A. mellifera scutellata) are being destroyed by parasitic workers of the Cape honeybee, A. m. capensis. These lay diploid eggs (\\"thelytoky\\"), escaping normal worker policing, leading to the colony's destruction; the parasites can then move to other hives.[72]\\r\\nThe cuckoo bees in the Bombus subgenus Psithyrus are closely related to, and resemble, their hosts in looks and size. This common pattern gave rise to the ecological principle \\"Emery's rule\\". Others parasitize bees in different families, like Townsendiella, a nomadine apid, two species of which are cleptoparasites of the dasypodaid genus Hesperapis,[73] while the other species in the same genus attacks halictid bees.[74]\\r\\nFour bee families (Andrenidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, and Apidae) contain some species that are crepuscular. Most are tropical or subtropical, but there are some which live in arid regions at higher latitudes. These bees have greatly enlarged ocelli, which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though incapable of forming images. Some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor. Their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.[75]\\r\\nVertebrate predators of bees include bee-eaters, shrikes and flycatchers, which make short sallies to catch insects in flight.[76] Swifts and swallows[76] fly almost continually, catching insects as they go. The honey buzzard attacks bees' nests and eats the larvae.[77] The greater honeyguide interacts with humans by guiding them to the nests of wild bees. The humans break open the nests and take the honey and the bird feeds on the larvae and the wax.[78] Among mammals, predators such as the badger dig up bumblebee nests and eat both the larvae and any stored food.[79]\\r\\nSpecialist ambush predators of visitors to flowers include crab spiders, which wait on flowering plants for pollinating insects; predatory bugs, and praying mantises,[76] some of which (the flower mantises of the tropics) wait motionless, aggressive mimics camouflaged as flowers.[80] Beewolves are large wasps that habitually attack bees;[76] the ethologist Niko Tinbergen estimated that a single colony of the beewolf Philanthus triangulum might kill several thousand honeybees in a day: all the prey he observed were honeybees.[81] Other predatory insects that sometimes catch bees include robber flies and dragonflies.[76]\\r\\nHoney bees are affected by parasites including acarine and Varroa mites.[82] However, some bees are believed to have a mutualistic relationship with mites.[20]\\r\\nThree bee maidens with the power of divination and thus speaking truth are described in Homer's Hymn to Hermes, and the food of the gods is \\"identified as honey\\"; the bee maidens were originally associated with Apollo, and are probably not correctly identified with the Thriae. Honey, according to a Greek myth, was discovered by a nymph called Melissa (\\"Bee\\"); and honey was offered to the Greek gods from Mycenean times. Bees were associated, too, with the Delphic oracle and the prophetess was sometimes called a bee.[83]\\r\\nThe image of a community of honey bees has been used from ancient to modern times, in Aristotle and Plato; in Virgil and Seneca; in Erasmus and Shakespeare; Tolstoy, and by political and social theorists such as Bernard Mandeville and Karl Marx as a model for human society.[84] In English folklore, bees would be told of important events in the household, in a custom known as \\"Telling the bees\\".[85]\\r\\nThe oldest examples of bees in art are rock paintings in Spain which have been dated to 15,000 BC.[86]\\r\\nW.

Yeats's poem The Lake Isle of Innisfree (1888) contains the couplet \\"Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee, / And live alone in the bee loud glade.\\" At the time he was living in Bedford Park in the West of London.[87]\\r\\nBeatrix Potter's illustrated book The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse (1910) features Babbity Bumble and her brood (pictured).\\r\\nKit Williams' treasure hunt book The Bee on the Comb (1984) uses bees and beekeeping as part of its story and puzzle.\\r\\nSue Monk Kidd's The Secret Life of Bees (2004), and the 2009 film starring Dakota Fanning, tells the story of a girl who escapes her abusive home and finds her way to live with a family of beekeepers, the Boatwrights.\\r\\nThe humorous 2007 animated film Bee Movie used Jerry Seinfeld's first script and was his first work for children; he starred as a bee named Barry B. Benson, alongside Rene Zellweger. Critics found its premise awkward and its delivery tame.[88]\\r\\nDave Goulson's A Sting in the Tale (2014) describes his efforts to save bumblebees in Britain, as well as much about their biology.\\r\\nThe playwright Laline Paull's fantasy The Bees (2015) tells the tale of a hive bee named Flora 717 from hatching onwards.[89]\\r\\nHumans have kept honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers.\\r\\nDepictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago; efforts to domesticate them are shown in Egyptian art around 4,500 years ago.[90] Simple hives and smoke were used;[91][92] jars of honey were found in the tombs of pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. From the 18th century, European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the colony.[93][94] Among Classical Era authors, beekeeping with the use of smoke is described in the History of Animals Book 9[95] (a book not written by Aristotle himself). The account mentions that bees die after stinging; that workers remove corpses from the hive, and guard it; castes including workers and non-working drones, but \\"kings\\" rather than queens; predators including toads and bee-eaters; and the waggle dance, with the \\"irresistible suggestion\\" of ?p򿼚ϫ (aroseiontai, it waggles) and ϫϫĲ? (parakolouthousin, they watch).[96][b]\\r\\nBeekeeping is described in detail by Virgil in his Eclogues; it is also mentioned in his Aeneid, and in Pliny's Natural History.[96]\\r\\nBees play an important role in pollinating flowering plants, and are the major type of pollinator in many ecosystems that contain flowering plants. It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on pollination by insects, birds and bats, most of which is accomplished by bees, whether wild or domesticated.[97][98]\\r\\nContract pollination has overtaken the role of honey production for beekeepers in many countries. From 1972 to 2006, feral honey bees declined dramatically in the US, and they are now almost absent.[99] The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder.[100] In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus Nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination.[101][102][103][104] Winter losses increased to about 1/3.[105][106] Varroa mites were thought to be responsible for about half the losses.[107]\\r\\nApart from colony collapse disorder, losses outside the US have been attributed to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as Clothianidin, Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam.[108][109][110] From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further.[111] In 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming.[112]\\r\\nHowever farmers have focused on alternative solutions in order to mitigate these problems. By raising native plants, they provide food for native bee pollinators like L. vierecki[113] and L. leucozonium,[114] leading to less reliance on honey bee populations.\\r\\nHoney is a natural product produced by bees and stored for their own use, but its sweetness has always appealed to humans. Before domestication of bees was even attempted, humans were raiding their nests for their honey. Smoke was often used to subdue the bees and such activities are depicted in rock paintings in Spain which have been dated to 15,000 BC.[86] Indigenous people in many countries eat insects, including consuming the larvae and pupae of bees, mostly stingless bees. They also gather \\"bee brood\\" (the larvae, pupae and surrounding cells) for consumption.[115] In the Indonesian dish botok tawon from Central and East Java, bee larvae are eaten as a companion to rice, after being mixed with shredded coconut, wrapped in banana leaves, and steamed.[116][117]\\r\\nHoney bees are used commercially to produce honey.[118] They also produce some substances used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits, pollen,[119] propolis,[120] and royal jelly,[121] though all of these can also cause allergic reactions.\\r\\nThe painful stings of bees are mostly associated with the poison gland and the Dufour's gland which are abdominal exocrine glands containing various chemicals. In Lasioglossum leucozonium, the Dufour's Gland mostly contains octadecanolide as well as some eicosanolide. There is also evidence of n-triscosane, n-heptacosane,[122] and 22-docosanolide.[123] However, the secretions of these glands could also be used for nest construction.[122]","input":"When did the first bees appear on earth?"},{"output":"80 minutes","context":"","input":"What is the duration of a rugby match?"},{"output":"determining the sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA, and of identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome from both a physical and  a functional standpoint","context":"The  Genome Project (HGP) was an international scientific research project with the goal of determining the sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA, and of identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome from both a physical and  a functional standpoint.[1] It remains the world's largest collaborative biological project.[2] After the idea was picked up in 1984 by the US government when the planning started, the project formally launched in 1990 and was declared complete on April 14, 2003[3]. Funding came from the US government through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as well as numerous other groups from around the world. A parallel project was conducted outside government by the Celera Corporation, or Celera Genomics, which was formally launched in 1998. Most of the government-sponsored sequencing was performed in twenty universities and research centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Spain and China.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Human Genome Project originally aimed to map the nucleotides contained in a human haploid reference genome (more than three billion).  The \\"genome\\" of any given individual is unique; mapping the \\"human genome\\" involved sequencing a small number of individuals and then assembling these together to get a complete sequence for each chromosome. Therefore, the finished human genome is a mosaic, not representing any one individual.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Human Genome Project was a 15-year-long, publicly funded project initiated in 1990 with the objective of determining the DNA sequence of the entire euchromatic human genome within 15 years.[5] In May 1985, Robert Sinsheimer organized a workshop to discuss sequencing the human genome,[6] but for a number of reasons the NIH was uninterested in pursuing the proposal. The following March, the Santa Fe Workshop was organized by Charles DeLisi and David Smith of the Department of Energy's Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER).[7]  At the same time Renato Dulbecco proposed whole genome sequencing in an essay in Science.[8]  James Watson followed two months later with a workshop held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that the Santa Fe workshop was motivated and supported by a Federal Agency opened a path, albeit a difficult and tortuous one,[9] for converting the idea into a public policy in the United States.  In a memo to the Assistant Secretary for Energy Research (Alvin Trivelpiece), Charles DeLisi, who was then Director of the OHER, outlined a broad plan for the project.[10]  This started a long and complex chain of events which led to approved reprogramming of funds that enabled the OHER to launch the Project in 1986, and to recommend the first line item for the HGP, which was in President Reagan's 1988 budget submission,[9] and ultimately approved by the Congress.  Of particular importance in Congressional approval was the advocacy of Senator Peter Domenici, whom DeLisi had befriended.[11]  Domenici chaired the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, as well as the Budget Committee, both of which were key in the DOE budget process.  Congress added a comparable amount to the NIH budget, thereby beginning official funding by both agencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvin Trivelpiece sought and obtained the approval of DeLisi's proposal by  Deputy Secretary William Flynn Martin. This chart[12] was used in the spring of 1986 by Trivelpiece, then Director of the Office of Energy Research in the Department of Energy, to brief Martin and Under Secretary Joseph Salgado regarding his intention to reprogram $4 million to initiate the project with the approval of Secretary Herrington. This reprogramming was followed by a line item budget of $16 million in the Reagan Administrations 1987 budget submission to Congress.[13]  It subsequently passed both Houses. The Project was planned for 15 years.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nCandidate technologies were already being considered for the proposed undertaking at least as early as 1985.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, the two major funding agencies, DOE and NIH, developed a memorandum of understanding in order to coordinate plans and set the clock for the initiation of the Project to 1990.[16] At that time, David Galas was Director of the renamed Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the U.S. Department of Energys Office of Science and James Watson headed the NIH Genome Program. In 1993, Aristides Patrinos succeeded Galas and Francis Collins succeeded James Watson, assuming the role of overall Project Head as Director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Human Genome Research (which would later become the National Human Genome Research Institute). A working draft of the genome was announced in 2000 and the papers describing it were published in February 2001. A more complete draft was published in 2003, and genome \\"finishing\\" work continued for more than a decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe $3-billion project was formally founded in 1990 by the US Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health, and was expected to take 15 years.[17] In addition to the United States, the international consortium comprised geneticists in the United Kingdom, France, Australia, China and myriad other spontaneous relationships.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to widespread international cooperation and advances in the field of genomics (especially in sequence analysis), as well as major advances in computing technology, a 'rough draft' of the genome was finished in 2000 (announced jointly by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the British Prime Minister Tony Blair on June 26, 2000).[19] This first available rough draft assembly of the genome was completed by the Genome Bioinformatics Group at the University of California, Santa Cruz, primarily led by then graduate student Jim Kent. Ongoing sequencing led to the announcement of the essentially complete genome on April 14, 2003, two years earlier than planned.[20][21] In May 2006, another milestone was passed on the way to completion of the project, when the sequence of the last chromosome was published in Nature.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project was not able to sequence all the DNA found in human cells.  It sequenced only euchromatic regions of the genome, which make up 92% of the human genome.  The other regions, called heterochromatic, are found in centromeres and telomeres, and were not sequenced under the project.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Human Genome Project was declared complete in April 2003. An initial rough draft of the human genome was available in June 2000 and by February 2001 a working draft had been completed and published followed by the final sequencing mapping of the human genome on April 14, 2003. Although this was reported to cover 99% of the euchromatic human genome with 99.99% accuracy, a major quality assessment of the human genome sequence was published on May 27, 2004 indicating over 92% of sampling exceeded 99.99% accuracy which was within the intended goal.[24] Further analyses  and papers on the HGP continue to occur.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2009, the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) released a more accurate version of the human genome, but that still left more than 300 gaps.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2018, the GRC still indicated 514 gaps, most of which are annotated as \\"stalled\\" or \\"under investigation/review\\", so it seems they will not be resolved any time soon.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sequencing of the human genome holds benefits for many fields, from molecular medicine to human evolution. The Human Genome Project, through its sequencing of the DNA, can help us understand diseases including: genotyping of specific viruses to direct appropriate treatment; identification of mutations linked to different forms of cancer; the design of medication and more accurate prediction of their effects; advancement in forensic applied sciences;  biofuels and other energy applications; agriculture, animal husbandry, bioprocessing; risk assessment;  bioarcheology, anthropology and evolution. Another proposed benefit is the commercial development of genomics research related to DNA based products, a multibillion-dollar industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sequence of the DNA is stored in databases available to anyone on the Internet. The U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (and sister organizations in Europe and Japan) house the gene sequence in a database known as GenBank, along with sequences of known and hypothetical genes and proteins. Other organizations, such as the UCSC Genome Browser at the University of California, Santa Cruz,[28] and Ensembl[29] present additional data and annotation and powerful tools for visualizing and searching it. Computer programs have been developed to analyze the data, because the data itself is difficult to interpret without such programs.  Generally speaking, advances in genome sequencing technology have followed Moores Law, a concept from computer science which states that integrated circuits can increase in complexity at an exponential rate.[30] This means that the speeds at which whole genomes can be sequenced can increase at a similar rate, as was seen during the development of the above-mentioned Human Genome Project.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe process of identifying the boundaries between genes and other features in a raw DNA sequence is called genome annotation and is in the domain of bioinformatics. While expert biologists make the best annotators, their work proceeds slowly, and computer programs are increasingly used to meet the high-throughput demands of genome sequencing projects. Beginning in 2008, a new technology known as RNA-seq was introduced that allowed scientists to directly sequence the messenger RNA in cells. This replaced previous methods of annotation, which relied on inherent properties of the DNA sequence, with direct measurement, which was much more accurate. Today, annotation of the human genome and other genomes relies primarily on deep sequencing of the transcripts in every human tissue using RNA-seq. These experiments have revealed that over 90% of genes contain at least one and usually several alternative splice variants, in which the exons are combined in different ways to produce 2 or more gene products from the same locus.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genome published by the HGP does not represent the sequence of every individual's genome. It is the combined mosaic of a small number of anonymous donors, all of European origin. The HGP genome is a scaffold for future work in identifying differences among individuals. Subsequent projects sequenced the genomes of multiple distinct ethnic groups, though as of today there is still only one \\"reference genome.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nKey findings of the draft (2001) and complete (2004) genome sequences include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Human Genome Project was started in 1990 with the goal of sequencing and identifying all three billion chemical units in the human genetic instruction set, finding the genetic roots of disease and then developing treatments. It is considered a megaproject because the human genome has approximately 3.3 billion base pairs. With the sequence in hand, the next step was to identify the genetic variants that increase the risk for common diseases like cancer and diabetes.[16][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was far too expensive at that time to think of sequencing patients whole genomes. So the National Institutes of Health embraced the idea for a \\"shortcut\\", which was to look just at sites on the genome where many people have a variant DNA unit. The theory behind the shortcut was that, since the major diseases are common, so too would be the genetic variants that caused them. Natural selection keeps the human genome free of variants that damage health before children are grown, the theory held, but fails against variants that strike later in life, allowing them to become quite common (In 2002 the National Institutes of Health started a $138 million project called the HapMap to catalog the common variants in European, East Asian and African genomes).[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genome was broken into smaller pieces; approximately 150,000 base pairs in length.[36] These pieces were then ligated into a type of vector known as \\"bacterial artificial chromosomes\\", or BACs, which are derived from bacterial chromosomes which have been genetically engineered. The vectors containing the genes can be inserted into bacteria where they are copied by the bacterial DNA replication machinery. Each of these pieces was then sequenced separately as a small \\"shotgun\\" project and then assembled. The larger, 150,000 base pairs go together to create chromosomes. This is known as the \\"hierarchical shotgun\\" approach, because the genome is first broken into relatively large chunks, which are then mapped to chromosomes before being selected for sequencing.[38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunding came from the US government through the National Institutes of Health in the United States, and a UK charity organization, the Wellcome Trust, as well as numerous other groups from around the world. The funding supported a number of large sequencing centers including those at Whitehead Institute, the Wellcome Sanger Institute (then called The Sanger Centre) based at the Wellcome Genome Campus, Washington University in St. Louis, and Baylor College of Medicine.[17][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) served as an important channel for the involvement of developing countries in the Human Genome Project.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, a similar, privately funded quest was launched by the American researcher Craig Venter, and his firm Celera Genomics. Venter was a scientist at the NIH during the early 1990s when the project was initiated. The $300,000,000 Celera effort was intended to proceed at a faster pace and at a fraction of the cost of the roughly $3 billion publicly funded project. The Celera approach was able to proceed at a much more rapid rate, and at a lower cost than the public project because it relied upon data made available by the publicly funded project.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nCelera used a technique called whole genome shotgun sequencing, employing pairwise end sequencing,[43] which had been used to sequence bacterial genomes of up to six million base pairs in length, but not for anything nearly as large as the three billion base pair human genome.\\r\\n\\r\\nCelera initially announced that it would seek patent protection on \\"only 200ÿ300\\" genes, but later amended this to seeking \\"intellectual property protection\\" on \\"fully-characterized important structures\\" amounting to 100ÿ300 targets. The firm eventually filed preliminary (\\"place-holder\\") patent applications on 6,500 whole or partial genes.\\r\\nCelera also promised to publish their findings in accordance with the terms of the 1996 \\"Bermuda Statement\\", by releasing new data annually (the HGP released its new data daily), although, unlike the publicly funded project, they would not permit free redistribution or scientific use of the data. The publicly funded competitors were compelled to release the first draft of the human genome before Celera for this reason. On July 7, 2000, the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group released a first working draft on the web. The scientific community downloaded about 500 GB of information from the UCSC genome server in the first 24 hours of free and unrestricted access.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2000, President Clinton announced that the genome sequence could not be patented, and should be made freely available to all researchers. The statement sent Celera's stock plummeting and dragged down the biotechnology-heavy Nasdaq. The biotechnology sector lost about $50 billion in market capitalization in two days.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the working draft was announced in June 2000, it was not until February 2001 that Celera and the HGP scientists published details of their drafts. Special issues of Nature (which published the publicly funded project's scientific paper)[45] and Science (which published Celera's paper[46]) described the methods used to produce the draft sequence and offered analysis of the sequence.  These drafts covered about 83% of the genome (90% of the euchromatic regions with 150,000 gaps and the order and orientation of many segments not yet established).  In February 2001, at the time of the joint publications, press releases announced that the project had been completed by both groups.  Improved drafts were announced in 2003 and 2005, filling in to approximately 92% of the sequence currently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the IHGSC international public-sector HGP, researchers collected blood (female) or sperm (male) samples from a large number of donors. Only a few of many collected samples were processed as DNA resources.  Thus the donor identities were protected so neither donors nor scientists could know whose DNA was sequenced. DNA clones from many different libraries were used in the overall project, with most of those libraries being created by Pieter J. de Jong's.  Much of the sequence (>70%) of the reference genome produced by the public HGP came from a single anonymous male donor from Buffalo, New York (code name RP11).[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nHGP scientists used white blood cells from the blood of two male and two female donors (randomly selected from 20 of each) ÿ each donor yielding a separate DNA library.  One of these libraries (RP11) was used considerably more than others, due to quality considerations.  One minor technical issue is that male samples contain just over half as much DNA from the sex chromosomes (one X chromosome and one Y chromosome) compared to female samples (which contain two X chromosomes). The other 22 chromosomes (the autosomes) are the same for both sexes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the main sequencing phase of the HGP has been completed, studies of DNA variation continued in the International HapMap Project, whose goal was to identify patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) groups (called haplotypes, or haps). The DNA samples for the HapMap came from a total of 270 individuals: Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria; Japanese people in Tokyo; Han Chinese in Beijing; and the French Centre dEtude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) resource, which consisted of residents of the United States having ancestry from Western and Northern Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Celera Genomics private-sector project, DNA from five different individuals were used for sequencing.  The lead scientist of Celera Genomics at that time, Craig Venter, later acknowledged (in a public letter to the journal Science) that his DNA was one of 21 samples in the pool, five of which were selected for use.[49][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, a team led by Jonathan Rothberg published James Watson's entire genome, unveiling the six-billion-nucleotide genome of a single individual for the first time.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work on interpretation and analysis of genome data is still in its initial stages. It is anticipated that detailed knowledge of the human genome will provide new avenues for advances in medicine and biotechnology. Clear practical results of the project emerged even before the work was finished. For example, a number of companies, such as Myriad Genetics, started offering easy ways to administer genetic tests that can show predisposition to a variety of illnesses, including breast cancer, hemostasis disorders, cystic fibrosis, liver diseases and many others. Also, the etiologies for cancers, Alzheimer's disease and other areas of clinical interest are considered likely to benefit from genome information and possibly may lead in the long term to significant advances in their management.[37][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also many tangible benefits for biologists. For example, a researcher investigating a certain form of cancer may have narrowed down their search to a particular gene. By visiting the human genome database on the World Wide Web, this researcher can examine what other scientists have written about this gene, including (potentially) the three-dimensional structure of its product, its function(s), its evolutionary relationships to other human genes, or to genes in mice or yeast or fruit flies, possible detrimental mutations, interactions with other genes, body tissues in which this gene is activated, and diseases associated with this gene or other datatypes. Further, deeper understanding of the disease processes at the level of molecular biology may determine new therapeutic procedures. Given the established importance of DNA in molecular biology and its central role in determining the fundamental operation of cellular processes, it is likely that expanded knowledge in this area will facilitate medical advances in numerous areas of clinical interest that may not have been possible without them.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe analysis of similarities between DNA sequences from different organisms is also opening new avenues in the study of evolution. In many cases, evolutionary questions can now be framed in terms of molecular biology; indeed, many major evolutionary milestones (the emergence of the ribosome and organelles, the development of embryos with body plans, the vertebrate immune system) can be related to the molecular level. Many questions about the similarities and differences between humans and our closest relatives (the primates, and indeed the other mammals) are expected to be illuminated by the data in this project.[37][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project inspired and paved the way for genomic work in other fields, such as agriculture. For example, by studying the genetic composition of Tritium aestivum, the worlds most commonly used bread wheat, great insight has been gained into the ways that domestication has impacted the evolution of the plant.[55] Which loci are most susceptible to manipulation, and how does this play out in evolutionary terms? Genetic sequencing has allowed these questions to be addressed for the first time, as specific loci can be compared in wild and domesticated strains of the plant. This will allow for advances in genetic modification in the future which could yield healthier, more disease-resistant wheat crops.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the onset of the Human Genome Project several ethical, legal, and social concerns were raised in regards to how increased knowledge of the human genome could be used to discriminate against people.  One of the main concerns of most individuals was the fear that both employers and health insurance companies would refuse to hire individuals or refuse to provide insurance to people because of a health concern indicated by someone's genes.[56]  In 1996 the United States passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) which protects against the unauthorized and non-consensual release of individually identifiable health information to any entity not actively engaged in the provision of healthcare services to a patient.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with identifying all of the approximately 20,000ÿ25,000 genes in the human genome, the Human Genome Project also sought to address the ethical, legal, and social issues that were created by the onset of the project. For that the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) program was founded in 1990. Five percent of the annual budget was allocated to address the ELSI arising from the project.[17][58] This budget started at approximately $1.57 million in the year 1990, but increased to approximately $18 million in the year 2014.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst the project may offer significant benefits to medicine and scientific research, some authors have emphasized the need to address the potential social consequences of mapping the human genome. \\"Molecularising disease and their possible cure will have a profound impact on what patients expect from medical help and the new generation of doctors' perception of illness.\\"[60]","input":"What was the aim of the human genome project?"},{"output":"Thomas McAllister","context":"","input":"Who did red john turn out to be?"},{"output":"manufacturers","context":"ANSI/TIA-568 is a set of telecommunications standards from the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA). The standards address commercial building cabling for telecommunications products and services.\\r\\nAs of 2017, the standard is at revision D, replacing the 2009 revision C, 2001 revision B, the 1995 revision A, and the initial issue of 1991, which are now obsolete.[1][2]\\r\\nPerhaps the best known features of ANSI/TIA-568 are the pin/pair assignments for eight-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling. These assignments are named T568A and T568B.\\r\\nAn IEC standard ISO/IEC 11801 provides similar standards for network cables.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANSI/TIA-568 was developed through the efforts of more than 60 contributing organizations including manufacturers, end-users, and consultants. Work on the standard began with the EIA, to define standards for telecommunications cabling systems. EIA agreed to develop a set of standards, and formed the TR-42 committee,[3] with nine subcommittees to perform the work. The work continues to be maintained by TR-42 within the TIA, EIA is not longer in existence and hence EIA has been removed from the name.\\r\\nThe first revision of the standard, TIA/EIA-568-A.1-1991 was released in 1991. The standard was updated to revision B in 1995. The demands placed upon commercial wiring systems increased dramatically over this period due to the adoption of personal computers and data communication networks and advances in those technologies. The development of high-performance twisted pair cabling and the popularization of fiber optic cables also drove significant change in the standards. These changes were first released in a revision C in 2009 which has subsequently been replaced by the D series.[4]\\r\\nANSI/TIA-568 defines structured cabling system standards for commercial buildings, and between buildings in campus environments. The bulk of the standards define cabling types, distances, connectors, cable system architectures, cable termination standards and performance characteristics, cable installation requirements and methods of testing installed cable. The main standard, ANSI/TIA-568.0-D defines general requirements, while ANSI/TIA-568-C.2 focuses on components of balanced twisted-pair cable systems. ANSI/TIA-568.3-D addresses components of fiber optic cable systems, and ANSI/TIA-568-C.4, addressed coaxial cabling components.[5]\\r\\nThe intent of these standards is to provide recommended practices for the design and installation of cabling systems that will support a wide variety of existing and future services. Developers hope the standards will provide a lifespan for commercial cabling systems in excess of ten years. This effort has been largely successful, as evidenced by the definition of category 5 cabling in 1991, a cabling standard that (mostly) satisfied cabling requirements for 1000BASE-T, released in 1999. Thus, the standardization process can reasonably be said to have provided at least a nine-year lifespan for premises cabling, and arguably a longer one.\\r\\nAll these documents accompany related standards that define commercial pathways and spaces (TIA-569-C-1, February 2013), residential cabling (ANSI/TIA-570-C, August 2012), administration standards (ANSI/TIA-606-B, June 2012), grounding and bonding (TIA-607-B-2, August 2013), and outside plant cabling (TIA-758-B, April 2012).\\r\\nThe standard defines categories of unshielded twisted pair cable systems, with different levels of performance in signal bandwidth, insertion loss, and cross-talk. Generally increasing category numbers correspond with a cable system suitable for higher rates of data transmission. Category 3 cable was suitable for telephone circuits and data rates up to 16 million bits per second. Category 5 cable, with more restrictions on attenuation and cross talk, has a bandwidth of 100?MHz.[6] The 1995 edition of the standard defined categories 3, 4, and 5. Categories 1 and 2 were excluded from the standard since these categories were only used for voice circuits, not for data.[7] The current revision includes Category 5e (100 MHz), 6 (250 MHz), 6A (500 MHz) and 8 (2,000 MHz).\\r\\nANSI/TIA-568-D defines a hierarchical cable system architecture, in which a main cross-connect (MCC) is connected via a star topology across backbone cabling to intermediate cross-connects (ICC) and horizontal cross-connects (HCC). Telecommunications design traditions utilized a similar topology. Many people refer to cross-connects by their telecommunications names: \\"distribution frames\\" (with the various hierarchies called MDFs, IDFs and wiring closets). Backbone cabling is also used to interconnect entrance facilities (such as telco demarcation points) to the main cross-connect. Maximum allowable backbone fibre distances vary between 300m and 3000m, depending upon the cable type and use.\\r\\nHorizontal cross-connects provide a point for the consolidation of all horizontal cabling, which extends in a star topology to individual work areas such as cubicles and offices. Under TIA/EIA-568-B, maximum allowable horizontal cable distance is 90m of installed cabling, whether fibre or twisted-pair, with 100m of maximum total length including patch cords. No patch cord should be longer than 5m. Optional consolidation points are allowable in horizontal cables, often appropriate for open-plan office layouts where consolidation points or media converters may connect cables to several desks or via partitions.\\r\\nAt the work area, equipment is connected by patch cords to horizontal cabling terminated at jackpoints.\\r\\nTIA/EIA-568 also defines characteristics and cabling requirements for entrance facilities, equipment rooms and telecommunications rooms.\\r\\nPerhaps the widest known and most discussed feature of ANSI/TIA-568 is the definition of the pin-to-pair assignments, or pinout, between the pins in a connector (a plug or a socket) and the wires in a cable.\\r\\nThe standard specifies how to connect eight-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted-pair cabling, such as Category 3 and Category 6 unshielded twisted-pair (UTP), to 8P8C eight-pin modular connectors (often incorrectly called RJ45 connectors).\\r\\nThe standard defines two alternative pinouts: T568A and T568B. The pinout definitions occupy merely 1 of the standard's 468 pages. Much attention is paid to them because cables do not function if the pinouts at their two ends aren't correctly matched.\\r\\nANSI/TIA-568 recommends the T568A pinout for horizontal cables. This pinout's advantage is that it is compatible with the 1-pair and 2-pair Universal Service Order Codes (USOC) pinouts. The U.S. Government requires it in federal contracts.\\r\\nThe standard also allows the T568B pinout, as an alternative \\"if necessary to accommodate certain 8-pin cabling systems\\". This pinout matches the older AT&T 258A (Systimax) pinout. In the 1990s, when the original TIA/EIA-568 was published, 258A had the most widely installed UTP cabling infrastructure. Many organizations still use T568B out of inertia.\\r\\nThe colors of the wire pairs in the cable, in order, are: blue (for pair 1), orange, green, and brown (for pair 4). Each pair consists of one conductor of solid color and a second conductor which is white with a stripe of the other color.\\r\\nThe difference between the two pinouts is that the orange and green wire pairs are exchanged.\\r\\nSee modular connector for numbering of the pins.[8]\\r\\nNote that the only difference between T568A and T568B is that pairs 2 and 3 (orange and green) are swapped. Both configurations wire the pins \\"straight through\\", i.e., pins 1 through 8 on one end are connected to pins 1 through 8 on the other end.[9] Also, the same sets of pins connect to the opposite ends that are paired in both configurations: pins 1 and 2 form a pair, as do 3 and 6, 4 and 5, and 7 and 8. One can use cables wired according to either configuration in the same installation without significant problem. The primary thing one has to be careful of, is not to accidentally wire the ends of the same cable according to different configurations (unless one intends to create an ethernet crossover cable) or, worse, swapping two lines from different pairs. This creates crosstalk, which is normally rectified by correctly twisting a pair together.[10] These problems will be most apparent in the more stringent specifications such as Category 6.\\r\\nIn Digital Signal 1 (T1) service, the pairs 1 and 3 (T568A) are used, and the USOC-8 jack is wired as per spec RJ-48C. The Telco termination jack is often wired to spec RJ-48X, which provides for a Transmit-to-Receive loopback when the plug is withdrawn.\\r\\nVendor cables are often wired with tip and ring reversedi.e. pins 1 and 2 reversed, or pins 4 and 5 reversed. This has no effect on the signal quality of the T1 signal, which is fully differential, and uses the Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI) signaling scheme.\\r\\nBecause pair 1 connects to the center pins (4 and 5) of the 8P8C connector in both T568A and T568B, both standards are compatible with the first line of RJ11, RJ14, RJ25, and RJ61 connectors that all have the first pair in the center pins of these connectors.\\r\\nIf the second line of an RJ14, RJ25 or RJ61 plug is used, it connects to pair 2 (orange/white) of jacks wired to T568A but to pair 3 (green/white) in jacks wired to T568B. This makes T568B potentially confusing in telephone applications.\\r\\nBecause of different pin pairings, the RJ25 and RJ61 plugs cannot pick up lines 3 or 4 from either T568A or T568B without splitting pairs. This would most likely result in unacceptable levels of hum, crosstalk and noise.\\r\\nThe original idea in wiring modular connectors, as seen in the registered jacks, was that the first pair would go in the center positions, the next pair on the next outermost ones, and so on. Also, signal shielding would be optimized by alternating the \\"live\\" and \\"earthy\\" pins of each pair. The terminations diverge slightly from this concept because on the 8 position connector, the resulting pinout would separate the outermost pair too far to meet the electrical echo requirements of high-speed LAN protocols.","input":"What types of organizations were involved in developing the tia/eia-568-b standard?"},{"output":"King's College","context":"Columbia University in New York City, United States, was founded in 1754 as King's College by royal charter of King George II of England. It is the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States. The period leading up to the school's founding was marked in controversy, with various groups competing to determine its location and religious affiliation. Advocates of New York City met with success on the first point, while the Church of England prevailed on the latter. However, all constituencies agreed to commit themselves to principles of religious liberty in establishing the policies of the College.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the City of New York had come under the control of the English in 1674, no serious discussions as to the founding of a university began until the early eighteenth-century. This delay is often attributed to the multitude of languages and religions practiced in the province, which made the founding of a seat of learning difficult. Colleges during the colonial period were regarded as a religious, no less a scientific and literary institution. The large gap between the founding of New York province and the opening of its first college stands in contrast to institutions such as Harvard University, which was created only six years after the founding of Boston, Massachusetts, a colony with a more homogenous Puritan population.[2] Discussions regarding the founding of a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, when Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college.[3] The lands on which Morris had initially designed the college to be built, known as \\"King's Farm, were vested to Trinity Church by Lord Cornburry, and nothing came of the proposition to form a college in the provence until almost fifty years later.[4] The founding of Harvard in 1636 and Yale in 1701 had set no competitive juices flowing among New Yorks merchants. But the announcement in the summer of 1745 that New Jersey, which had only seven years before secured a government separate from New Yorks and was still considered by New Yorkers to be within its cultural catch basin, was about to found the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, demanded an immediate response.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1746 an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise a sum of S2,250 by public lottery for the foundation of a new college, despite the fact that the University had neither a founding denomination nor a location for its first campus. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were Church of England members, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.[6] In March of the following year, the vestrymen of Trinity Church offered the commission the six-northernmost acres of its property for the foundation of the college, which settled the problem of the college's first campus; however, considerable outcry from William Livingston and other members of the commission who believed that the college should be nonsectarian caused further delay in the college's founding. Despite Livingston's objections, the commission voted to accept the lands from Trinity Church on the condition that the college's affiliation be Church of England.[7] The commission chose as the college's first president Dr. Samuel Johnson, a preeminent scholar who had received his doctorate from The University of Oxford, and had been sought in similar capacity to preside over the College of Philadelphia, now The University of Pennsylvania.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nClasses were initially held in July 1754, the delay stemming from the inability of the college to secure adequate faculty. Dr. Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students.  Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church, located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan.[9] The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of King George II, making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.[1] On June 3 of the following year, the Governors of the College adopted a design prepared by Dr. Johnson for the seal of King's College, which continues to be that of Columbia College with the alteration in name.[10] \\r\\nIn 1760, King's College moved to its own building at Park Place, near the present City Hall, and in 1767 it established the first American medical school to grant the M.D. degree.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nControversy surrounded the founding of the new college in New York, as it was a thoroughly Church of England institution dominated by the influence of Crown officials in its governing body, such as the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Fears of the establishment of a Church of England episcopacy and of Crown influence in America through King's College were underpinned by its vast wealth, far surpassing all other colonial colleges of the period.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1763, Dr. Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the political controversies which preceded The American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the College was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, Alexander Hamilton. On one occasion, a mob came to the College, bent on doing violence to the president, but Hamilton held their attention with a speech, giving Cooper enough time to escape. The next year the Revolutionary War broke out and the College was turned into a military hospital and barracks.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Revolution and the subsequent war were catastrophic for the operation of King's College. It suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the Continental Army in the spring of that year.  The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.[14][15] Although the college had been considered a bastion of Tory sentiment,[16] it nevertheless produced many key leaders of the Revolutionary generation  individuals later instrumental in the college's revival. Among the earliest students and trustees of King's College were five \\"founding fathers\\" of the United States: John Jay, who negotiated the Treaty of Paris between the United States and the Kingdom of Great Britain, ending the Revolutionary War, and who later became the first Chief Justice of the United States; Alexander Hamilton, military aide to General George Washington, author of most of the Federalist Papers, and the first Secretary of the Treasury; Gouverneur Morris, the author of the final draft of the United States Constitution; Robert R. Livingston, a member of the Committee of Five, that drafted the Declaration of Independence; and Egbert Benson who represented New York in the Continental Congress and the Annapolis Convention, and who was a ratifier of the United States Constitution.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing's college had been in a state of abeyance for eight years by the time the war ended, with many of the members of the college's Board of Governors either absent or killed during the revolution. The college turned to the State of New York in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the schools charter the state might demand.[17] The Legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May?1, 1784, it passed \\"an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College.\\"[18] The Act created a Board of Regents to oversee the resuscitation of King's, giving them the power to hire a college president and appoint professors, but prohibiting the College from administering any \\"religious test-oath\\" to its faculty. Finally, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the Legislature stipulated that \\"the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of Columbia College.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 5, 1784, the Regents held their first meeting, instructing Treasurer Brockholst Livingston and Secretary Robert Harpur (who was Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at King's) to recover the books, records and any other assets that had been dispersed during the war, and appointing a committee to supervise the repairs of the college building. In addition, the Regents moved quickly to rebuild Columbia's faculty, appointing William Cochran instructor of Greek and Latin.[18] In the summer of 1784, after the legislature passed the act restoring the college, Major General James Clinton, a hero of the revolutionary war, brought his son DeWitt Clinton to New York on his way to enroll him as a student at the College of New Jersey. When James Duane, the Mayor of New York and a member of the Regents, heard that the younger Clinton was leaving the state for his education, he pleaded with Cochran to offer him admission to the reconstituted Columbia. Cochran agreed  partly because DeWitt's uncle, George Clinton, the Governor of New York, had recently been elected Chancellor of the College by the Regents  and DeWitt Clinton became one of nine students admitted to Columbia in the year 1784.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the period under the Regents, many efforts were made to put the University on respectable footing, resolving to organize the college into the four faculties of Arts, Divinity, Medicine, and Law. A number of different professorships were created within each faculty, while the college remained under the supervision of the Regents. The staff of the entire university - which included numerous aforementioned professors, a president, a secretary, and a librarian ÿ operated under the yearly budget of S1,200.[19] During this period no president was able to be appointed due to the college's inadequate funds, which rendered it unable to offer a salary as would induce a suitable person to accept the office.  Instead, the duties of the president's office were held by the schools various professors, which led to discord between the school's faculty members. The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college, still in use today, granting power to a private board of twenty-four Trustees.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, the son of Dr. Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected President of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the University, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.[21] For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. Both President George Washington and Vice President John Adams attended the College's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school that had been instrumental in bringing about the independence of the fledging United States of America.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the period of Johnson's presidency, the College's campus began to expand, and in 1792 a new library extension was built to accommodate the College's growing library with the help of a grant from the Legislature of New York State. In December 1793, the Professorship of Law was filled by the election of James Kent, who gave the first instruction of law at any American University and was a forerunner to the University's Law School.[23] On July 16, 1800, the seventy-four-year-old Dr. Johnson resigned his presidency of the College.[24] In 1801, the Board of Trustees appointed Charles Henry Wharton as Dr. Johnson's successor. Wharton was to assume the office of president at the August commencement ceremonies, but he did not appear for them, and resigned in the fall.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the College's liberal acceptance of various religious and ethnic groups, during the period from 1785ÿ1849 the institutional life of the college was a continuous struggle for existence, owing to inadequate means and lack of financial support.[23][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe curriculum of the college during the beginning of the 19th century was mostly focused on study of the classics. As a result, the major prerequisite for admission into the College was familiarity with Greek and Latin and a basic understanding of mathematics. In 1810, following the advice of a committee put together by members of the school, the College greatly tightened its admission standards; nonetheless, admission of qualified students increased, with 135 students matriculating in 1810.[27] In the preceding decade, the average size of the graduating class had been seventeen.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the school had no athletic program, student life during this period was mainly focused around literary groups such as the Philolexian Society, which was founded in 1802. In 1811, the College's new president William Harris presided over what became known as the \\"\\"Riotous Commencement\\" in which students violently protested the faculty's decision not to confer a degree upon John Stevenson, who had inserted objectionable words into his commencement speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main building which housed the College was decayed and unsightly in appearance; however, the funds of the College were augmented somewhat by the growing importance of its investments in real estate, although the true value of some of these acquisitions would not come to light until over a century later. For example, in 1814 the New York Legislature responded to the College's appeal for financial assistance by giving the school the Elgin Botanic Garden, a twenty-acre tract of land that had been privately developed as the nation's first botanical garden by physician David Hosack, but which Hosack had closed and resold to the state at a loss.[29] The site, which had been 3? miles outside of the city limits in 1801, was leased by Columbia to John D. Rockefeller Jr. in the 1920s for the construction of Rockefeller Center.[29][30] It was still owned by Columbia until 1985, when it was sold for $400 million.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1813, the College agreed to combine its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, a new school created by the Regents of New York, forming Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. During the 1820s, the College renovated its campus and continued to seek grants from the state while it slowly expanded the scope of its academic catalog, adding Italian courses in 1825.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe College's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the remaining forty years, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the College functioned. Adding to the woes of the College during this period, in 1831 the school began to face direct competition in the form of the University of the City of New York, which was later to become New York University. This new university had a more utilitarian curriculum, which stood in contrast to Columbia's focus on ancient literature. As a demonstration of NYU's popularity, by the second year of its operation it had 158 students, whereas Columbia College, eighty years after its founding, only had 120. Trustees of Columbia attempted to block the founding of NYU, issuing pamphlets to dissuade the Legislature from opening another university while Columbia continued to struggle financially.[33] By July, 1854 the Christian Examiner of Boston, in an article entitled \\"The Recent Difficulties at Columbia College\\", noted that the school was \\"good in classics\\" yet \\"weak in sciences\\", and had \\"very few distinguished graduates\\".[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Charles King became Columbia's president in November 1849, the College was in large amounts of debt, having exceeded their annual expenditure by about $2200 for the past fifteen years. On his formal inauguration, King spoke on the duties and responsibilities of the university staff, and espoused the virtues of copying the English university system.[35] By this time, the College's investments in New York real estate, particularly the  Botanical Garden, became a primary source of steady income for the school, mainly owing to the city's rapidly increasing population.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1857, the College moved from Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th?Street and Madison Avenue, where it remained for the next fifty years. The transition to the new campus coincided with a new outlook for the college; during the commencement of that year, College President Charles King proclaimed Columbia \\"a university\\". During the last half of the nineteenth century, under the leadership of President F.A.P. Barnard, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a true modern university. Columbia Law School was founded in 1858, and in 1864 the School of Mines, the country's first such institution and the precursor to today's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, was established. Barnard College for women, established by the eponymous Columbia president, was established in 1889; the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons came under the aegis of the University in 1891, followed by Teachers College, Columbia University in 1893. The Graduate Faculties in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science awarded its first PhD in 1875.[34][37] This period also witnessed the inauguration of Columbia's participation in intercollegiate sports, with the creation of the baseball team in 1867, the organization of the football team in 1870, and the creation of a crew team by 1873. The first intercollegiate Columbia football game was a 6ÿ3 loss to Rutgers. The Columbia Daily Spectator began publication during this period as well, in 1877.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1896, the trustees officially authorized the use of yet another new name, Columbia University, and today the institution is officially known as \\"Columbia University in the City of New York.\\" Additionally, the engineering school was renamed the \\"School of Mines, Engineering and Chemistry.\\" At the same time, university president Seth Low moved the campus again, from 49th?Street to its present location, a more spacious (and, at the time, more rural) campus in the developing neighborhood of Morningside Heights. The site was formerly occupied by the Bloomingdale Lunatic Asylum. One of the asylum's buildings, the warden's cottage (later known as East Hall and Buell Hall), still stands today.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building often depicted as emblematic of Columbia is the centerpiece of the Morningside Heights campus, Low Memorial Library. Constructed in 1895, the building is still referred to as \\"Low Library\\" although it has not functioned as a library since 1934. It currently houses the offices of the President, Provost, the Visitor's Center, and the Trustees' Room and Columbia Security. Patterned loosely on the Classical Pantheon, it is surmounted by the largest all-granite dome in the United States.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the leadership of Low's successor, Nicholas Murray Butler, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the \\"multiversity\\" model that later universities would adopt. On the Morningside Heights campus, Columbia centralized on a single campus the College, the School of Law, the Graduate Faculties, the School of Mines (predecessor of the Engineering School), and the College of Physicians & Surgeons. Butler went on to serve as president of Columbia for over four decades and became a giant in American public life (as one-time vice presidential candidate and a Nobel Laureate). His introduction of \\"downtown\\" business practices in university administration led to innovations in internal reforms such as the centralization of academic affairs, the direct appointment of registrars, deans, provosts, and secretaries, as well as the formation of a professionalized university bureaucracy, unprecedented among American universities at the time.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1893 the Columbia University Press was founded to \\"promote the study of economic, historical, literary, scientific and other subjects; and to promote and encourage the publication of literary works embodying original research in such subjects.\\" Among its publications are The Columbia Encyclopedia, first published in 1935, and The Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer of the World, first published in 1952. In 1902, New York newspaper magnate Joseph Pulitzer donated a substantial sum to the University for the founding of a school to teach journalism. The result was the 1912 opening of the Graduate School of Journalismthe only journalism school in the Ivy League. Columbia does not, however, offer an undergraduate degree in journalism. In New York City, there are only two universities that offer such degrees:St. John's University (New York) and New York University. The school is the administrator of the Pulitzer Prize and the duPont-Columbia Award in broadcast journalism.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1904 Columbia organized adult education classes into a formal program called Extension Teaching (later renamed University Extension). Courses in Extension Teaching eventually give rise to the Columbia Writing Program, the Columbia Business School, and the School of Dentistry.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College.[44] The college was closed in 1938 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently absorbed into University Extension.[45] In 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the School of General Studies in response to the return of GIs after World War II.[46] In 1995, the School of General Studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more) and was fully integrated into Columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum.[47] Within the same year, the Division of Special Programslater the School of Continuing Education, and now the School of Professional Studieswas established to reprise the former role of University Extension.[48] While the School of Professional Studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages, it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the late 1930s, a Columbia student could study with the likes of Jacques Barzun, Paul Lazarsfeld, Mark Van Doren, Lionel Trilling, and I. I. Rabi. The University's graduates during this time were equally accomplishedfor example, two alumni of Columbia's Law School, Charles Evans Hughes and Harlan Fiske Stone (who also held the position of Law School dean), served successively as Chief Justices of the United States. Dwight Eisenhower served as Columbia's president from 1948 until he became the President of the United States in 1953.[50][51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch into the atom by faculty members John R. Dunning, I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia's Physics Department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project.[53] Following the end of World War II, the School of International Affairs was founded in 1946, beginning by offering the Master of International Affairs. To satisfy an increasing desire for skilled public service professionals at home and abroad, the School added the Master of Public Administration degree in 1977. In 1981, the School was renamed the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). The School introduced an MPA in Environmental Science and Policy in 2001 and, in 2004, SIPA inaugurated its first doctoral program  the interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Sustainable Development.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, Columbia, Morningside Heights campus, was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1960s Columbia experienced large-scale student activism centering over the Vietnam War and the demand for greater student rights. Many students, led by the Students for a Democratic Society and its President Mark Rudd protested the University's ties with the defense establishment and its controversial plans to build a gym in Morningside Park. The fervor on campus reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied various buildings on campus. The incident forced the resignation of Columbia's then President, Grayson Kirk and the establishment of the University Senate.[56][57]\\r\\n\\r\\nColumbia College first admitted women in the fall of 1983, after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College, an all female institution affiliated with the University, to merge the two schools. Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia, and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas authorized by both Columbia University and Barnard College.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the late 20th century, the University underwent significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university. For much of the 19th century, the University consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[59] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, the Columbia Engineering School was renamed the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, in honor of Chinese businessman Z. Y. Fu, who gave Columbia $26?million. The school is popularly referred to as \\"SEAS\\" or simply \\"the engineering school.\\"[61]","input":"What was the original name of columbia university?"},{"output":"27 BC","context":"","input":"When did the romans dominate the iberian peninsula?"},{"output":"1,800 acre (730 ha)","context":"City of San Diego\\r\\nMailing address:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe San Diego Zoo Safari Park, originally named the San Diego Wild Animal Park until 2010, is an 1,800 acre (730 ha) zoo in the San Pasqual Valley area of San Diego, California, near Escondido.

Although the park is primarily within the San Diego city limits,[6] it has an Escondido address.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe San Diego Zoological Society became interested in developing the Wild Animal Park in 1964. The idea of the park began as a supplementary breeding facility for the San Diego Zoo, which would allow ample space for large animals and ungulates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development proposed would differ significantly from that of a typical zoo in that animals would be exhibited in a natural environment rather than in cages. In 1964, the park was assessed financially and then moved onto the next phase; this resulted in three alternative developments. There was an idea for a conservation farm, a game preserve, and a natural environment zoo. The natural environment zoo development was chosen over the conservation farm and game preserve even though it was the most expensive option. The estimated initial cost was $1,755,430.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main purposes of this zoo were to be species conservation, breeding of animals for the San Diego Zoo as well as other zoos and providing areas where zoo animals could be conditioned. When it came to naming the park, five titles were considered: San Diego Animal Land, San Diego Safari Land, San Diego Wild Animal Safari, San Diego Wildlife Park and San Diego Wild Animal Park.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scheduled opening day of the park was set for April 1, 1972; however, the gates did not open until Wednesday May 10, 1972.[7] \\r\\nThe general layout of the park, designed by Charles Faust, included a large lagoon with a jungle plaza, an African fishing village, an aviary at the entrance of the park and approximately 50,000 plants were to be included in the landscaping.[7] Although the park was scheduled to open in three years from the time of the groundbreaking, the total development of the park was estimated to take ten years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first two animals to arrive at the park were the nilgai, an antelope from the plains of North India, and the black-and-white striped Grant's zebra, native to East Africa.[7]\\r\\nOther animals to arrive at the park include the gemsbok, a type of oryx from Namibia, the sable antelope, a horse antelope from Central & South Africa, the greater kudu, a striped, sprial horned antelope from East & South Africa, the white rhinoceros who was in danger of extinction & 10 cheetahs, the fastest land animal, who were brought to the park for breeding purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 2003, the San Diego Zoological Society and Lowry Park Zoo orchestrated the capture of 11 wild African elephants from the Hlane Royal National Park in Swaziland. The zoos said the animals were scheduled to be killed due to overpopulation.[8] However, In Defense of Animals disputes this, claiming that new fencing costing many times less than the capture and transport would have ended the need to remove any elephants from Swaziland, and that the Save Wild Elephants Coalition reported that there were three other sanctuaries in Africa that had offered to take the elephants.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFive of these elephants are now at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park,[8] and cumulatively they have produced thirteen babies as of 2013.[10][11]  In March 2012 five elephants were moved to the Reid Park Zoo in Tucson, Arizona, to form a new herd. A bull elephant, two cows, and two baby bulls were moved and in return two cow elephants that had been together for years. Connie, an Asian elephant, and Shaba, an African elephant, were sent to the San Diego Zoo.[12][13]  Connie died from cancer in July 2012 just five months after the move. Shaba was slowly introduced into the herd in February 2013.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe California wildfires that officially started on October 21, 2007, burned 600 acres (2.4?km2) of native habitat preserved in the park and caused it to temporarily close. The park also moved many of their endangered animals out of danger. The fire did not reach any of the main enclosures, and no animals were killed directly by the fire, although deaths of a clapper rail and kiang were attributed to indirect effects of the blaze.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 30, 2010 the San Diego Zoo board of trustees voted to change the name of the park from the Wild Animal Park to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to clarify what it offers, since some visitors were unclear as to the difference between the zoo proper and the \\"animal park\\". The name \\"safari\\" is supposed to emphasize \\"the park's spacious enclosures of free-ranging animals\\" (as opposed to \\"the closer quarters of the zoo\\"), encouraging visits to both locations.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park's largest exhibits, covering over 300 acres (120?ha),[16] are the open-range enclosures. Visitors view various plains habitats from Africa and Asia.\\r\\nAsian Savanna covers 60 acres (24?ha) and displays Indian rhinoceros, Bactrian camels, banteng, gaur, argali, mouflon, dholes and several species of Asian deer and antelope such as blackbuck, barasingha, sika deer, axis deer, Pre David's deer, nilgai, white-lipped deer, sambar, and wapiti.[16]\\r\\nAfrican Plains represents many regions and habitats. East Africa displays cape buffalo, southern white rhinoceros, Rothschild's giraffe, reticulated giraffe, beisa, fringe-eared oryx, waterbuck, Nile lechwe, impala, Grant's gazelle, Thomson's gazelle, and a lagoon with East African crowned cranes[16] The North Africa exhibit represents the Sahel and Sahara that houses  scimitar-horned oryx, barbary stag, red-fronted gazelle, Barbary sheep and Ankole-Watusi cattle.[16]  The Southern Africa field exhibits Grvy's zebras. The South Africa field exhibit holds Masai giraffes, common eland, sable antelope, gemsbok, springbok, blue wildebeest, & ostrich.[17] The Central Africa region features a wooded waterhole with an island for pink-backed pelicans, saddle-billed storks, and Rppell's vultures. On the shores of the lake are bongo antelope, red river hog, greater kudu, Ugandan kob, grey rhebok, roan antelope, and other forest animals.[17] A number of smaller enclosures visible only from the tram are home to Somali wild ass, Nubian ibex, kiangs, Arabian oryx, bharal, gorals, Japanese serows, markhor, Soemmerring's gazelles, black rhinoceroses, Slender-horned gazelles, and Przewalski's horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecies of note in the open enclosures include two subspecies of giraffe, rhinos (the park has the world's most successful breeding program for southern white rhinos[citation needed] and was the last New World zoo to have northern white rhinoceros), gaur, vultures, markhor, and many species of antelope, gazelle, and deer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sumatran tigers have three different exhibits, and there is a glass viewing window for visitors.[18][19] After raising $19.6 million for the new exhibit ground was broken on December 12, 2012. The new exhibit is named the Tull Family Tiger Trail after movie producer Thomas Tull and his wife.[20] Tiger Trail opened May 24, 2014. \\r\\nThe park's Nairobi Village houses numerous exhibits for smaller animals. Among these are meerkats, an African aviary, ring-tailed lemurs, Chilean flamingos, pud~, dik-dik antelope, Yellow-backed duiker, red river hogs, black crowned crane, and white-fronted bee-eaters.[21] A large lagoon is home to numerous species of waterfowl, both foreign & native, as well as shoebill storks.[21] Lorikeet Landing and Hidden Jungle display feedable lories and lorikeets, and African birds, respectively. There is a nursery where visitors can watch baby animals being hand-reared as well as a nearby petting corral.[21] Finally, a gorilla habitat houses a troop of western lowland gorillas.[21] A Rodrigues flying fox bat exhibit also located there.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated in Nairobi Village, this climate-controlled indoor exhibit opened in 1993[22] and displays tropical African birds and insects.[23] The entrance to the building is a simulated earthen crevasse with displays for stick insects, spiders, scorpions, insects, millipedes, lizards, & snakes.[22] The underground segment opens up to a room representing the rainforest understory, which leads to a second room representing the canopy. On display are long-tailed paradise whydah, purple grenadier, red-crested turaco, African pygmy goose, beautiful sunbird and other birds.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nHidden Jungle is the setting of the annual Butterfly Jungle event.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOpened in October 2004, Lion camp houses the park's thirteen African lions in a 1-acre (0.40?ha) exhibit.[24] One side of the enclosure is dominated by an artificial rock kopje which has a 40-foot-long (12?m) glass viewing window and heated rocks.[24] The path continues along an acacia-studded ravine and leads to a replica observation tent. This has a smaller viewing window as well as a Land Rover for the lions to rest on.\\r\\nCondor Ridge displays endangered North American desert wildlife.[25] The featured species are California condors[25] (the Wild Animal Park was the key force in the recovery effort for these birds and this is one of the only places in the world where the public can see them in captivity) and desert bighorn sheep.[25] Other species displayed include aplomado falcons, \\r\\nloggerhead shrikes, thick-billed parrots, bald eagles, prairie dogs, black footed ferrets, magpies, ocelots, porcupines, Harris's hawks, and desert tortoises.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormerly known as Heart of Africa, these are two of the park's major exhibits. Visitors go down a trail which replicates habitats in Africa. The exhibit begins in African Woods with scrub animals - bontebok, \\r\\nvultures such as the Egyptian vulture & the hooded vulture, and giant eland. It then progresses to the forest (okapi, duikers, red river hogs, gerenuk, steenbok, blue cranes, demoiselle cranes, wattled cranes, and Abdim's storks). The path then leads to African Outpost, which features plains animals - warthogs, bat eared foxes, ground hornbills, kori bustards, secretary birds, white storks, yellow-billed storks, cheetahs & nyalas - against a backdrop of the open-range East Africa exhibit. A central lagoon has lesser and greater flamingos, waterfowl, sitatunga, an island with black-and-white colobus monkeys, and an interpretive research camp on a separate island.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park formerly operated a monorail line, the Wgasa Bush Line, which ran through the Wild Animal Park. The name of the monorail was chosen by chief designer Chuck Faust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Monorail line has been retired, partially due to high maintenance costs, and in March 2007 the Journey into Africa attraction, now renamed Africa Tram, opened. The Africa Tram tour brings visitors to the field exhibits to see wildlife from different parts of Africa. In addition, another route is planned to bring visitors through the Asian field exhibits and into eight new ones that will house a variety of African animals from rock hyrax to Hartmann's mountain zebras. The tour utilizes a wheeled tram that runs on biofuel instead of a monorail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as the tram, the park has also added a tethered balloon ride that allows visitors to see the plains exhibits from 400 feet (120?m) in the air.[26] The balloon ride is not included in the entrance fee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park also has extensive botanical gardens, many of which are their own attractions separate from the animal exhibits. \\r\\n\\r\\nWalkabout Australia is the park's only Australia exhibit.[27] It is 3.6 acres and guests can go inside an exhibit which features western grey kangaroos, red necked wallabies, Australian brushturkeys, radjah ducks, freckled ducks and magpie geese. Walkabout Australia also has two southern cassowary exhibits, a Matschie's tree-kangaroo exhibit and an animal ambassador area where guests can meet the safari park's Australian animal ambassadors. Walkabout Australia also has a restaurant and a devils marbles area. Walkabout Australia is included with zoo admission and a new exhibit called Platypus Pond which will be home to two platypuses. The exhibit will be part of the Walkabout Australia and is expected to open sometime in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Safari Park was a major factor in the recovery of the California condor. Beginning in 1980, it worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Los Angeles Zoo to start a captive breeding program.[28] The last 22 condors were taken into captivity in 1987[28] To breed the condors quickly, the Safari Park would remove the eggs from the nests to induce the females to lay a second egg.[28][29] The removed egg hatches in an incubator and is raised with a condor handpuppet to prevent human imprinting, while the second egg is raised by its parents.[28][29] Captive-bred condors were reintroduced into the wild beginning in 1992, and today their population is 369, with 191 in the wild as of March 2011.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 14, 2014, Angalifu, a 44-year-old male northern white rhinoceros, died at the park. This left only five northern white rhinos left in the world, including one female at the Safari Park.[30]\\r\\nOn November 22, 2015, the park's last Northern White Rhino, Nola was euthanized due to bacterial infection and her health rapidly declining\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Safari Park has received several awards for its breeding programs and conservation efforts.","input":"How big is the san diego zoo safari park?"},{"output":"260,897","context":"","input":"What was the population of the city of venice?"},{"output":"Avengers #55 (1968)","context":"Ultron (/??ltr?n/) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is most recognized as a nemesis of the Avengers, and has a quasi-familial relationship with his creator Hank Pym. He was the first Marvel Comics character to wield the fictional metal alloy adamantium.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nUltron has been voiced by Tom Kane and by Jim Meskimen in several media adaptations. The character is played by James Spader in the 2015 film Avengers: Age of Ultron.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character initially appeared as an unnamed character in a cameo in The Avengers #54 (1968), with a first full appearance in Avengers #55 (1968). Ultron was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema. Thomas, who has acknowledged he finds naming characters difficult, said he liked the -tron suffix and went from there.[3] Thomas said the idea of the character and his appearance were heavily based on Makino, an obscure robotic villain who appeared in an issue of the Captain Video comic book.[1] He liked the robot's malicious looking smile, showing this to Buscema.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Ultron first appears in Avengers #54 (1968), the character is disguised for the majority of the issue as the \\"Crimson Cowl\\", with his face only revealed on the last page of the issue and no name given to the character. The character leads the Masters of Evil against the Avengers, having hypnotized Edwin Jarvis into working for him. In the following issue Avengers #55 (August 1968), the character is identified as Ultron-5, The Living Automaton.[4] In Avengers #57ÿ58 (OctoberÿNovember 1968), a flashback sequence revealed that Ultron created the \\"synthezoid\\" Vision as a weapon to destroy the Avengers. The Visionhaving Wonder Man's brain patternsdestroys Ultron with the Avengers' aid.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther flashbacks reveal that Ultron is Hank Pym's creation, and is based on Pym's brain patterns. The robot gradually developed its own intelligence and rebelled, and almost immediately develops an Oedipus complex, whereby it feels irrational hatred for Hank, and demonstrates an interest in the Wasp (Janet van Dyne). Rebuilding itself, learning how to turn itself on, and upgrading five times, Ultron then hypnotizes and brainwashes his \\"father\\" into forgetting that the robot had ever existed.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character's next appearance is in Avengers #66ÿ68 (JulyÿSeptember 1969), where the character, now referring to itself as Ultron-6, uses the fictional alloy adamantium to upgrade his body to an almost indestructible state and takes the new name Ultimate Ultron. His plans to destroy humanity are again thwarted by the Avengers.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nA crossover story between Avengers #127 (Sept. 1974) and Fantastic Four #150 (Sept. 1974) features Ultron (as Ultron-7), recreated by Maximus with the body of the android Omega, attacking the wedding of the Inhuman Crystal and the Avenger Quicksilver, and battling the Avengers, Inhumans and Fantastic Four before being destroyed once again.[8] The character next appears in Avengers #161ÿ162 (JulyÿAug. 1977) as Ultron-8 where he is responsible for Jocasta's creation as a robotic bride.[9] Shortly afterwards, in Avengers #170ÿ171 (AprilÿMay 1978), the Avengers, with Ms. Marvel's aid, battle and defeat Ultron-8.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis next appearances are in Avengers #201ÿ202 (Nov.ÿDec 1980) as Ultron-9 and in Marvel Two-In-One #92ÿ93 (Oct.ÿNov. 1982) as Ultron-10; both appearances feature brainwashed heroes re-creating and then defeating the robotic menace.[11][12] After being briefly recreated as Ultron-11 by the Beyonder and appearing on Battleworld during the Secret Wars,[13] and for a brief encounter with the Thing,[14] Ultron is destroyed again. The Thing, however, does bring Ultron's head back to Earth as a souvenir. Ultron-11's head is dropped and forgotten by the Thing when there is an attack by the alien Dire Wraiths.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nA new version, known as Ultron-12, enters into an alliance with the Grim Reaper and the villain's allies (Nekra; the Erik Josten Goliath; Man-Ape and the Black Talon) in a bid to destroy Wonder Man. Although the villains are defeated by the West Coast Avengers, Ultron-12 begins to form a relationship with his \\"father\\" Henry Pym.[16] Ultron-12 begins calling itself Ultron Mark 12, in an effort to sound more human.[17] Rebuilding itself, Ultron-11 comes into conflict with Hank and Ultron-12. With Wonder Man's assistance, they destroy Ultron-11. Ultron-12 then deactivates, but tells Pym it was glad it could help save him.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDoctor Doom rebuilds Ultron using a combination of all of Ultron's previous personalities with a particularly strong dose of Ultron-12, believing this mix will make Ultron subservient. Instead, all 12 iterations coexist as separate personalities, resulting in a form of madness which culminates with Ultron-12 mutilating himself in an attempt to remove some of his other personalities. Karnak, Daredevil and Gorgon destroy Ultron by severing his neck cables.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother version, known as Ultron-13, appears and is stopped by the West Coast Avengers.[20] After escaping captivity, this version attempts to obtain a new form of vibranium called Nuform, but is repelled by the combined efforts of Iron Man, the Black Panther and Spider-Man.[21] Ultron-13 next briefly appears as a captive of a highly advanced Doombot, but is freed when the Doombot is defeated by Deathlok.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nUltron-13 escapes from prison and upgrades into the Ultimate Ultron (technically Ultron-14), and captures the West Coast Avenger Mockingbird to use Mockingbird's brain patterns to create the new robotic mate Alkhema. Alkhema aids Ultron but both are eventually jettisoned into space through a ruse by the Vision.[23] The character reappears with Alkhema, and together they plan to create a \\"volcanic winter\\" by placing bombs underneath several volcanoes. The West Coast Avengers stop the pair once again, and Alkhema rebels and leaves Ultron.[24] Another version, known as Ultron-15, is found by the Vision, but is discovered to have been \\"infected\\" by human emotion and is seriously deteriorating, displaying symptoms that resemble alcoholism. This iteration and Jocasta decide to explore the world with the Vision for a time.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a brief cameo appearance as Ultron-17,[26] the character - with the aid of Ultron-16 - slaughters the population of the fictional state Slorenia, having perfected a process that allows it to control a vast army of Ultron drones (mainly made of titanium steel and about a tenth of the army only made of secondary adamantium), while attempting to acquire neural patterns from his 'family'- Pym, Janet, the Vision, Wonder Man, Scarlet Witch, and the Grim Reaper- to create a new 'family' of robots that would allow him to create a more diverse range of personalities. However, he is finally defeated by the Avengers, Goliath using vibranium against him, acknowledging his own guilt and self-loathing over the belief that Ultron's twisted persona reflects his own darker thoughts.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Avengers discovered that Ultron's creations (Vision, Jocasta and Alkhema) have a secret program included - they are subconsciously compelled to rebuild Ultron. In this case, it is Alkhema who unintentionally rebuilds Ultron when attempting to create a new species of bio-synthezoids. However, Ultron-18 is composed of steel not adamantium, and is destroyed when Alkhema's subterranean base exploded after Hawkeye shot Alkhema with a vibranium arrow at Alkhema's request. Ultron's head was recovered by Antigone, an artificial girl and one of the synthezoids.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIron Man encounters a version from an old version of Iron Man's armor and Ultron-18's head that leads the cult known as the Sons of Yinsen in an attempt to conquest via religion. The character is defeated by Iron Man and Jocasta.[30] Another version (possibly Ultron-13) creates the cyborg Victor Mancha as a sleeper agent against the Avengers. Mancha, however, rebels and joins the Runaways.[31] This version first poses as \\"Doctor Doom\\" before revealing itself, and is defeated in a battle against the Runaways and Excelsior.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Marvel launched a new title called The Mighty Avengers by Brian Michael Bendis and Frank Cho, Ultron interfaces with Iron Man's armor, which had been integrated with Tony Stark's biology. This allows Ultron's program to transform Iron Man into a new version who has the Wasp's appearance albeit with a metallic skin. This version takes control of Iron Man's technology. He kills Lindy Reynolds, causing the Sentry to battle Ultron, nearly tearing his head off. This version is eventually destroyed by New Avenger Ares using a computer virus (created by the Skrull agent Criti-Noll impersonating Hank Pym) to wipe Ultron's program from Iron Man's armor, changing Stark back to normal. Ultron's image later briefly appears on one of his maker's computers.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this was not the end of Ultron, for his disembodied consciousness was thrown into the depths of space. He spent a few months floating through the cosmos as radio waves and energy. Eventually his signal was picked up by an outlying group of Phalanx who were attempting to contact their parent race, the Technarchy. Fascinated by what he found, Ultron decided that the Phalanx lacked direction from a singular consciousness, and that he would be perfect for the role. Through sheer force of will, he merged himself with the Phalanx's programming. In turn, the Phalanx viewed Ultron as the sympathetic father they had yearned for. Under Ultrons guidance, the Phalanx began the Annihilation: Conquest by invading the Kree space. Later by taking control of Adam Warlock's body, Ultron hopes to achieve \\"true techno-organic perfection\\" but is eventually forced to abandon Adam's body by the Technarchy Warlock and is later destroyed in combat by Wraith and Quasar.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the limited series Avengers/Invaders, it is revealed that S.H.I.E.L.D. Life Model Decoys have been partly replaced with versions of Ultron. When the original Human Torch appears in the present, they covertly parasitize the Human Torch's unique android physiology and become more human. The combined super teams (but mainly the Human Torch himself), however, discover the plan and destroy the androids.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Mighty Avengers, Ultron is shown to infiltrate Jocasta and the Infinite Avengers Mansion. He names himself Ultron Pym and seeks to kill and replace his father before using his Infinite Mansion to conquer the universe.[36] Pym eventually offers Ultron a compromise, allowing Jocasta to become Ultron's bride, on the condition that Ultron banishes himself to ultraspace. Ultron agrees, but warns that he will be ruler of all someday.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Avengers, the team visits a possible future in which almost all of humanity is destroyed by Ultron. Kang the Conqueror attempts to enlist them to defeat the robotic foe, but another group of heroes and villains, plucked from all over time and space, ends up destroying this version.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, also in Avengers, a cabal of super-intelligent supervillains discover a Galadorian Spaceknight's inert body and attempt to reactivate its power source, hoping to exploit. Although the Avengers interrupt their attempts, the body activates, revealing that Ultron's consciousness was contained within and had escaped destruction after Annihilation: Conquest. The new version escapes and Iron Man gravely foresees that when he returns, it will bring the apocalypse for humanity.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Age of Ultron storyline, which takes place in an alternate universe, Ultron has returned and conquers the world while slowly remolding it into his image. His Ultron Sentinels are guarding the streets looking for any fugitives. Hawkeye runs into the Ultron Sentinels as he was rescuing the Superior Spider-Man yet manages to destroy the Ultron Sentinels present.[40] It is later revealed that Ultron is actually in the future and has been using Vision as a conduit to punish humanity.[41] While one strike team travels into the future to fight Ultron, Wolverine and the Invisible Woman go back in time to kill Pym before Ultron's creation in the first place.[42] This results in a world where Tony Stark controls an army of robotic drones and Morgan le Fay has conquered half of the world.[43] Traveling back in time once more, Wolverine succeeds in stopping himself from killing Pym, and Wolverine, Pym and Susan Storm come up with a different plan. This plan results in a different outcome of the prior confrontation between the Avengers and the Intelligencia - a 'back door' installed into Ultron at his original creation allows Hank and Iron Man to destroy the robot, instead, averting the events that led to the \\"Age of Ultron\\".[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is later revealed that years earlier, the Avengers had trapped an unidentified iteration of Ultron in deep space after sealing him inside a Vibranium Quinjet. In the present, the Quinjet crash lands on Titan, freeing Ultron. By hijacking the ISAAC computer, he transforms Titan into Planet Ultron, and launches a plan to infect the entire universe with a nanite virus that transforms organic creatures into Ultron Sentries. The ensuing confrontation with the Avengers leads to Ultron inadvertently merging with his maker, transforming the two into a human/machine hybrid. The resulting creation playing on Hank's self-loathing of his own human weakness causes an acceptance of this new state. He is defeated when Starfox's powers force Ultron to love himself, causing the part of Ultron that is now Hank to accept his old weakness and flaws while the villain has a mental breakdown and flees into space.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the \\"All-New, All-Different Marvel\\" branding, Ultron's fused form with \\"Hank Pym\\" resurfaced. While on his way back to Earth, Pym helped the crew of a spaceship that was being attacked by a hostile insectoid alien. After coming aboard the spaceship, Hank introduced himself as well as his \\"friend\\" Ultron to the crew.[46] He later returns to Earth, where the Wasp and Captain America discover that Ultron has taken complete control and is using Pym's face to fool his maker's old friends.[47] After Ultron incapacitates Deadpool, Cable, and the Human Torch, the Wasp initiates the Icarus Protocol and Iron Man is called in to help stop Ultron with the aid of the Hulkbuster Armor.[48] The Avengers end up defeating Ultron by plunging the hybrid into the sun, but both Hank and Ultron survive and continue to do battle with one another internally.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Secret Empire storyline, Ultron's fused form had set up a base in a unidentified forest. Upon being alerted by the approach of Sam Wilson's task force by a robot version of Edwin Jarvis, Ultron decides to give his \\"family\\" a warm welcome.[50] When Tony Stark A.I.'s team and Captain America's team confront each other, they are captured by Ultron who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table. Ultron argues that he is doing this because the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man despite past experience confirming that this should be a bad idea, but the Tony Stark A.I. counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Hank Pym's attack on Wasp. Outraged, Ultron nearly attacks the other heroes, but Scott Lang is able to talk him down by arguing that Pym remains his own inspiration. Ultron allows the Tony Stark A.I.'s team to leave with the fragment, arguing that he will leave Captain America's plans with Hydra alone as it appears to be the best chance for world peace.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Infinity Countdown, Ultron discover that the Infinity Stones were restored and began a quest to collect them all.[52] He goes to claim the Soul Gem while the aliens he infected with his virus are sent to Earth to take the Space Stone from Wolverine, and while they failed at their task, Ultron was able to steal the Soul Gem from Magus after ruthlessly killing him. Unbeknownst to Ultron, however, as he claimed the Soul Stone, the fragment that is of Hank's soul, entered the Soul World where he is greeted by the fragment of Gamora's soul, who revealed that he was going to be trapped there forever.[53] Ultron has also completely controlled the planet Saiph with Ultron hybrids and had captured the Silver Surfer. When Adam Warlock went to Saiph, he discovers the hybrids infusing the Soul Stone into the Surfers forehead while at the same time trying to transforming him into an Ultron hybrid.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visual appearance and powers of the character have varied, but common powers include superhuman levels of strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes; flight at subsonic speeds; and various offensive weapons such as concussive blasts of energy fired from its optical sensors or hands and an \\"encephalo-ray\\", which places victims into a deathlike coma. The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and mind-control victims, or implant subliminal hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Ultron also has the ability to convert electromagnetic radiation into electrical energy for use or storage. Ultron has a genius intellect, a capacity for creative intelligence and self-repair, superhuman cybernetic analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The character is an expert roboticist and strategist.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltron's outer armor is usually composed primarily of adamantium, which is almost completely impervious to damage (the first use of the term \\"adamantium\\" in Marvel Comics was made in reference to Ultron in Avengers #66, published in July 1969). Most Ultron units are powered by a small internal nuclear furnace and incorporate a \\"program transmitter\\" which can beam part or all of Ultron's memory/personality system into other computer systems or duplicate robotic bodies. Ultron can also control other machines remotely. Ultron has occasionally reformed itself with a humanoid appearance above the waist and the appearance of a complex machine, including tractor beam apparatus for flight, below the waist. A later Ultron model developed hive-mind technology, allowing it to animate and control hundreds of other Ultron bodies simultaneously,[55] although only the 'prime' Ultron was composed of adamantium while others were made of steel or secondary adamantium due to the lack of resources to give all the Ultrons adamantium bodies.[56] Ultron also used an internal molecular rearranger that renders the adamantium components of its workings more malleable and so has the ability to restructure its physical form. What circuitry Ultron has is carefully shielded to protect from damage, although the Scarlet Witch is capable of causing malfunctions with her hex power,[57] Johnny Storm, using his nova burst, managed to damage Ultron's internal circuits while its outer armor remained intact,[58] and Wonder Man was once able to destroy an Ultron by throwing it so hard its internal systems were damaged.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1995 limited series The Last Avengers Story features a possible future in which Ultron-59 manipulates fellow Avengers foe Kang the Conqueror into attacking the Avengers. Ultron is destroyed by the Vision, sacrificing his own artificial life.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fantastic Four storyline \\"Death of The Invisible Woman\\" features an advanced humanoid called Alex Ultron, a member of the futuristic The Last Defenders.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Marvel Adventures alternate universe, Ultron is a highly-intelligent \\"neural network\\" that controls a section of the United States defense forces.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mark Millar and Steve McNiven's 2008-2009 \\"Old Man Logan\\" story arc that appeared in Wolverine, Ultron Eight is the husband of Spider-Man's youngest daughter (Ashley Barton).[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first arc of the fourth Avengers series, Kang wages a war with Ultron in the not-too-distant future which causes the disruption of all time. The cause of the disruption is apparently Kang's recruiting of army after army from the timelines to battle Ultron - all to no avail: Ultron is supreme in this particular future.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title Avengers Next, set in the alternate universe known as MC2, features an upgraded version of Ultron named Ultron Extreme.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Earth-110 reality, Ultron assisted Doctor Doom, Hulk, Magneto, Namor, and the Red Skull in taking over Manhattan.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of the character is initially depicted as the Ultron Sentries, a group of robots created by Hank Pym alongside the partner robot Vision II. Although both robots were rejected by Nick Fury, the Ultron Sentries were used helping the Ultimates fight against the Liberators.[66] However, one unit develops an independent mind and emotions as a result of a chance encounter with the Scarlet Witch.[67] This unit appears as Yellowjacket and is in part responsible for Scarlet Witch's murder. Motivated by jealousy after having fallen in love, Yellowjacket's person of romance had feelings only for Quicksilver. Despite being the creator of android duplicates of Ultimates, Yellowjacket/Ultron is ultimately destroyed by its maker.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2013 crossover Age of Ultron storyline,[69] involves a post-apocalyptic future in which Ultron has taken over the world and exterminated most of the world's superheroes.[70] After Wolverine and the Invisible Woman try to avert this timeline by killing Hank Pym before Ultron's creation,[71] the resulting worse future prompts Wolverine to go back again and stop his past self from killing Pym, instead suggesting that Pym implant a command code in Ultron that will allow Pym to shut the robot down when he reaches a certain level of development.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2014 Original Sin storyline, the Time Gem transports the Avengers to a future where Ultron has conquered the world and created his own team of robotic Avengers to police the remaining human population.[73] This timeline is later revisited when someone posing as Doctor Doom uses his time machine to assemble a team of Avengers from across history to help liberate the planet from Ultron's rule,[74] culminating in the temporally-displaced Avengers defeating Ultron and convincing Doomÿin reality a Doombot that worked with the Avengers A.I. teamÿto bring peace to the world by seeking his own path rather than blindly following Doom's example.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2015 Secret Wars crossover event, the southern part of Battleworld is a wasteland uncontrolled by a baron. The wastelands are controlled by three ruling factions: Annihilus and his insect swarm, Marvel Zombies, and Ultron, who calls his realm \\"Perfection\\". When not battling among themselves the factions assault a great wall made out of Ben Grimm called SHEILD, manned by those banished from Battleworld, called Hel-Rangers. Eventually the three factions unite the powers and overrun the wall.[76][77][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nUltron was ranked number 23 by IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Villains list,[95] was listed number 189 in Wizard's Top 200 Greatest Villains Ever list,[96] and was ranked as the 189th Greatest Comic Book Character Ever in Wizard's list of the 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time.[97]","input":"When did ultron first appear in the comics?"},{"output":"31 August 1907","context":"The Triple Entente (from French entente [?t?t] \\"friendship, understanding, agreement\\") refers to the understanding linking the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente on 31 August 1907. The understanding between the three powers, supplemented by agreements with Japan and Portugal, was a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.\\r\\nHowever, Italy did not side with Germany and Austria during World War I and joined the Entente instead in the Treaty of London (1915).\\r\\nHistorians continue to debate the importance of the alliance system as one of the causes of World War I. At the start of World War I in 1914, all three Triple Entente members entered it as Allies against the Central Powers: Germany and Austria-Hungary.[1]\\r\\nHowever, the Triple Entente, unlike the Triple Alliance or the Franco-Russian Alliance, was not an alliance of mutual defense. Thus, Britain felt free to make its own foreign policy decisions in the 1914 July Crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOtto von Bismarck planned to isolate France diplomatically; he feared that France's revanchist aspirations might make it attempt to regain its losses suffered in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War.[2] The alliance also served to fight against progressive sentiments, which the conservative rulers found unsettling, such as the First International.[3]\\r\\nHowever, the League faced great difficulty with the growing tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary, mainly over the Balkans, where the rise of nationalism and the continued decline of the Ottoman Empire made many former Ottoman provinces struggle for independence.[4]\\r\\nThe situation in the Balkans, especially in the wake of the Serbo-Bulgarian War and the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, which made Russia feel cheated of its gains made in the Russo-Turkish War, prevented the League from being renewed in 1887.[5]\\r\\nIn an attempt to stop Russia from allying with France, Bismarck signed the secret Reinsurance Treaty with Russia in 1887. The treaty assured that both parties would remain neutral if war broke out.[6]\\r\\nThe alliance between Russia and France and Bismarcks exclusion of Russia from the German financial market in 1887 prevented the treaty from being renewed in 1890. That ended the alliance between Germany and Russia.[7]\\r\\nAfter the Reinsurance Treaty was not renewed in 1890,[8] Russian leaders grew alarmed at the country's diplomatic isolation and joined the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1894.[7]\\r\\nIn 1904, Britain and France signed a series of agreements, the Entente cordiale, mostly in solving colonial disputes.\\r\\nThat heralded the end of British splendid isolation and was partly a response to growing German antagonism, as expressed in the expansion of the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) to become a battle fleet that could threaten the supremacy of the British Royal Navy.\\r\\nThe Entente, unlike the Triple Alliance and the Franco-Russian Alliance, was not an alliance of mutual defence and so Britain was free to make its own foreign policy decisions in 1914. As British Foreign Office Official Eyre Crowe minuted, \\"The fundamental fact of course is that the Entente is not an alliance. For purposes of ultimate emergencies it may be found to have no substance at all. For the Entente is nothing more than a frame of mind, a view of general policy which is shared by the governments of two countries, but which may be, or become, so vague as to lose all content\\".[9]\\r\\nIn 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 to end their rivalry in Central Asia, nicknamed The Great Game.\\r\\nIn the last decade of the nineteenth century, Britain continued its policy of \\"splendid isolation\\", with its primary focus on defending its massive overseas empire. However, by the early 1900s, the German threat had increased dramatically, and in Britain thought it was in need of allies. For most of the 19th century, Britain had regarded France and Russia as its two most dangerous rivals, but with the growing threat of Germany, policy began to change for several reasons:\\r\\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War of 1870ÿ1871, Prussia defeated the Second French Empire, resulting in the establishment of the Third Republic. In the Treaty of Frankfurt, Prussia forced France to cede Alsace-Lorraine to the new German Empire. Ever since, relations had been poor.\\r\\nFrance, worried about the escalating military development of Germany, began building up its own war industries and army to deter to German aggression. Also, France developed a strong bond with Russia by ratifying the Franco-Russian Alliance, which was designed to create a strong counter to the Triple Alliance. Frances main concerns were to protect against an attack from Germany and to regain Alsace-Lorraine.\\r\\nRussia had by far the largest manpower reserves of all the six European powers, but it was also the most backward economically. Russia shared Frances worries about Germany. After the Germans started to reorganise the Ottoman army, Russia feared that they would come to control the Dardanelles, a vital trade artery that carried two fifths of Russia's exports.[10]\\r\\nThere was also Russia's long history of rivalry with Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary had recently annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, greatly angering Russia, which had considered itself the leader of the Slavic world (Pan-Slavism). Russia viewed the invasion as another step towards annexing Serbia and Montenegro.\\r\\nRussia had also recently lost the humiliating Russo-Japanese War, a cause of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the apparent transformation into a constitutional monarchy. To counter its enemies militarily and politically, Russia sought to revive the Franco-Russian Alliance.\\r\\nAlthough it was perceived as useless during the war with Japan, the alliance was valuable in the European theatre. Russia also signed the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 with Britain to counteract the threat of the Triple Alliance.\\r\\nThe alignment of the autocratic Russian Empire with Europe's two largest democracies was controversial on both sides. Many Russian conservatives mistrusted the secular France and recalled British past diplomatic maneuvers to block Russian influence in the Near East. In turn, prominent French and British journalists, academics and parliamentarians found the reactionary tsarist regime distasteful. Mistrust persisted even during wartime, with British and French politicians expressing relief when Tsar Nicholas II abdicated and was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government after the February Revolution in 1917. An offer of political asylum for the Romanovs was even withdrawn by the British king for fear popular reaction.[11] Also, France never brought up the subject of asylum with the deposed tsar.","input":"When was the triple alliance and triple entente formed?"},{"output":"five pounds","context":"The British crown, the successor to the English crown and the Scottish dollar, came into being with the Union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland in 1707. As with the English coin, its value was five shillings.\\r\\nAlways a heavy silver coin weighing around one ounce, during the 19th and 20th centuries the crown declined from being a real means of exchange to being a coin rarely spent and minted for commemorative purposes only. In that format it has continued to be minted, even following decimalisation of the British currency in 1971. However, as the result of inflation the value of the coin was revised upwards in 1990 to five pounds.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coin's origins lay in the English silver crown, one of many silver coins that appeared in various countries from the 16th century onwards, the most famous example perhaps being the famous Spanish pieces of eight, all of which were of a similar size and weight (approx 38mm diameter and containing approx 25?grams of fine silver) and thus interchangeable in international trade.[2] The kingdom of England also minted gold Crowns in the 16th and 17th centuries.\\r\\nThe dies for all gold and silver coins of Queen Anne and King George I were engraved by John Croker, a migrant originally from Dresden in the Duchy of Saxony.[3]\\r\\nThe British crown was always a large coin, and from the 19th century it did not circulate well. However, crowns were usually struck in a new monarch's coronation year, true of each monarch since King George IV up until the present monarch in 1953, with the single exception of King George V.\\r\\nThe Queen Victoria \\"Gothic\\" crown of 1847 (with a mintage of just 8,000) and produced to celebrate the Gothic revival) is considered by many to be the most beautiful British coin ever minted[citation needed].\\r\\nThe King George V \\"wreath\\" crowns struck from 1927 through 1936 (excluding 1935 when the more common \\"rocking horse\\" crown was minted to commemorate the King's Silver Jubilee) depict a wreath on the reverse of the coin and were struck in very low numbers. Generally struck late in the year and intended to be purchased as Christmas gifts, they did not circulate well, with the rarest of all dates, 1934 (mintage just 932), now fetching several thousand pounds each. The 1927 \\"wreath\\" crowns were struck as proofs only (15,030 minted).\\r\\nWith its large size, many of the later coins were primarily commemoratives. The 1951 issue was for the Festival of Britain, and was only struck in proof condition. The 1953 crown was issued to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, while the 1960 issue (which carried the same reverse design as the previous crown in 1953) commemorated the British Exhibition in New York. The 1965 issue carried the image of Winston Churchill on the reverse, the first time a non-monarch or commoner was ever placed on a British coin, and marked his death. According to the Standard Catalogue of coins, 19,640,000 of this coin were minted, a very high number at the time, making them of little value today except as a mark of respect for the national war leader. Production of the Churchill Crown began on 11 October 1965, and stopped in the summer of 1966.\\r\\nThe crown was worth five shillings (a shilling being 12 pre-decimal pence) until decimalisation in February 1971, and was also the basis of other denominations such as the half crown and double crown.\\r\\nThe last five shilling piece was minted in 1965.\\r\\nThe crown coin was nicknamed the dollar, but is not to be confused with the British trade dollar that circulated in the Orient.\\r\\nIn 2014, a new world record price was achieved for a milled silver crown. The coin was issued as a pattern by engraver Thomas Simon in 1663 and nicknamed the \\"Reddite Crown\\". This was presented to Charles II as the new crown piece but was ultimately rejected in favour of the Roettiers Brothers' design. Auctioneers Spink & Son of London sold the coin on 27 March 2014 for S396,000 including commission.[4]\\r\\nAfter decimalisation on 15 February 1971, a new coin known as a 25p (25 pence) piece was introduced. Whilst being legal tender,[5] and having the same decimal value as a crown, the 25p pieces were issued to commemorate events, such as: the 1972 piece was for the Silver Wedding anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; the 1977 issue was to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee of ascension to the throne; the 1980 issue was for the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother; and, in 1981, the coin was issued to celebrate the marriage of Charles, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer. All of these issues were struck in large mintages, in plastic cases, and in cupro-nickel, an alloy of 75% copper and 25% nickel. However, in addition to this, limited numbers of collectors' coins of these modern issues were struck to proof quality separately by the Royal Mint in sterling (92.5%) silver and presented with certificates of authenticity in boxes. The mintages for the silver proof 25p coins issued are as follows:\\r\\nFurther issues continue to be minted to the present day, initially with a value of twenty-five pence, and then, from 1990, with a value of five pounds.\\r\\nThe legal tender value of the crown remained as five shillings from 1544 to 1965. However, for most of this period there was no denominational designation or \\"face value\\" mark of value displayed on the coin. From 1927 to 1939, the word \\"CROWN\\" appears, and from 1951 to 1960 this was changed to \\"FIVE SHILLINGS\\". After decimalisation in 1971, the face value kept its five shillings equivalent at 25 new pence, later simply 25 pence, although the face value is not shown on any of these issues.\\r\\nFrom 1990, the crown was re-tariffed at five pounds (S5),[1] probably in view of its relatively large size compared with its face value, and taking into consideration its production costs, and the Royal Mint's profits on sales of commemorative coins. While this change was understandable, it has brought with it a slight confusion, and the popular misbelief that all crowns have a five-pound face value, including the pre-1990 ones.\\r\\nAlthough all \\"normal\\" issues since 1951 have been composed of cupro-nickel, special proof versions have been produced for sale to collectors, and as gift items, in silver, gold, and occasionally platinum.\\r\\nThe fact that gold S5 crowns are now produced means that there are two different strains of five pound gold coins, namely crowns and what are now termed \\"quintuple sovereigns\\" for want of a more concise term.[6][7]\\r\\nNumismatically, the term \\"crown-sized\\" is used generically to describe large silver or cupro-nickel coins of about 40?mm in diameter. Most Commonwealth countries still issue crown-sized coins for sale to collectors.\\r\\nNew Zealand's original fifty-cent pieces, and Australia's previously round but now dodecagonal fifty-cent piece, although valued at five shillings in predecimal accounting, are all smaller than the standard silver crown pieces issued by those countries (and the UK). They were in fact similarly sized to the predecimal half crown (worth two shillings and sixpence).\\r\\nFor silver crowns, the grade of silver adhered to the long-standing standard (established in the 12th century by Henry II)?ÿ the Sterling Silver standard of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper. This was a harder-wearing alloy, yet it was still a rather high grade of silver. It went some way towards discouraging the practice of \\"clipping\\", though this practice was further discouraged and largely eliminated with the introduction of the milled edge seen on coins today.\\r\\nIn a debasement process which took effect in 1920, the silver content of all British coins was reduced from 92.5% to 50%, with a portion of the remainder consisting of manganese, which caused the coins to tarnish to a very dark colour after they had been in circulation for a significant period. Silver was eliminated altogether in 1947, with the move to a composition of cupro-nickel?ÿ except for proof issues, which returned to the pre-1920 92.5% silver composition.\\r\\nSince standardisation of the UK's silver coinage in 1816 (UK Coinage Reform 1816), a crown has, as a general rule, had a diameter of 38.61?mm (1.52\\"), and weighed 28.276g (1?oz).[8]\\r\\nThe 1953 Coronation Crown, obverse\\r\\nThe 1953 Coronation Crown, reverse\\r\\n1896 'old head' Queen Victoria Crown\\r\\nThe 1934 George V 'Wreath' Crown","input":"How much is a crown in english money?"},{"output":"Freetown","context":"","input":"What is the capital of sierra leone africa?"},{"output":"Nabi Tajima","context":"This is a list of the 100 verified oldest people.

The league consists of two divisions, the WSL 1 and the WSL 2. It is run by the Football Association and began in April 2011. An initial eight teams competed in one division, which replaced the FA Women's Premier League as the highest level of women's football in England. The current WSL 1 champions are Chelsea, who won the one-off FA WSL Spring Series.[1]\\r\\nThe FA WSL 2, introduced in 2014, added a second division and a further 10 teams to the league. There is promotion and relegation between the two divisions, and promotion for 2016 and 2017 from the FA Women's Premier League (level 3). WSL has operated as a summer league running from March until October, from its creation until the end of the 2016 season. From autumn 2017, the league will operate as a winter league from September to May, with a one-off shortened bridging season from February to May 2017.[2] The WSL champions and runners-up qualify for the UEFA Women's Champions League the following season.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FA WSL was due to start in 2010 but was deferred for a year due to the global economic downturn.[3] Sixteen clubs applied for a place in the inaugural season of the league: Arsenal, Barnet, Birmingham City, Bristol Academy, Chelsea, Colchester United, Doncaster Rovers Belles, Everton, Leeds Carnegie, Leicester City, Lincoln Ladies, Liverpool, Millwall Lionesses, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Sunderland.[4] Leeds Carnegie later withdrew their application.[5] Women's Premier League clubs Blackburn Rovers and Watford declined to apply.[6] FA Chief Executive Ian Watmore described the creation of the league as a \\"top priority\\" in February 2010.[7]\\r\\nFor the 2014 season the league was extended. A second division was created, with 9 new teams added and one team being relegated from the WSL 1. WSL 1 remained as 8 teams, with the WSL 2 having 10 teams.[8][9][10][11] The new WSL 1 licence was awarded to Manchester City. Doncaster Rovers Belles were relegated to the WSL 2, with nine new licences awarded to: London Bees; Durham; Aston Villa; Millwall Lionesses; Yeovil Town; Reading; Sunderland; Watford; and Oxford United.[12] Doncaster Belles appealed against their demotion, but were unsuccessful.[13]\\r\\nIn December 2014, the FA WSL announced a two-year plan to expand WSL 1 from an eight to 10-team league. Two teams will be promoted from WSL 2, while one team will be relegated to WSL 2.[14][15] Also, for the first time, a team from the FA Women's Premier League can earn promotion to WSL 2, effectively connecting the WSL to the rest of the English women's football pyramid. In 2015, Sheffield FC Ladies became the first club to take this promotion place by beating Portsmouth FC Ladies 1-0 in the FA WPL Championship Play Off Final.[16]\\r\\nThis will leave WSL 1 with nine teams and WSL 2 with 10 teams for the 2016 season, and with the process repeated the following year, both WSL 1 and WSL 2 will have 10 teams each for the 2017 season.[14] In addition to being able to prove their financial solvency, clubs applying for entry to the WSL must show they will attract an average of 350 spectators in 2016, increasing to at least 400 in 2017.[17]\\r\\nThe FA announced in July 2016 that the league would move from a summer league format to a winter one in line with the traditional football calendar in England, with matches played from September to May the following year. A shortened bridging season took place, branded as The FA WSL Spring Series, with teams playing each other once from February to May 2017.[2]\\r\\nThe WSL consists of nineteen member clubs and the season is currently played over the summer months.[18] Initially the league was described as professional, with the top four players on each team being paid an annual salary in excess of S20,000.[19] However, in November 2010 it was confirmed that the WSL will be semi-professional, with only a \\"handful\\" of top players full-time.[20] Clubs' annual wage bills will be approximately one-tenth of those in the American WPS.[20] The FA envisage that the league will become fully professional in future, should it prove successful.[21]\\r\\nDuring the inaugural campaign, a mid-season break commenced on 12 May 2011, to allow for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. The season then resumed in early July, finishing in August 2011.[22]\\r\\nAfter the league fixtures, the teams compete for a knock-out cup competition, the FA WSL Continental Cup.[23] For the 2014 season, the teams are placed into three regional groups of 6. The group winners and best-performing runners-up all advance to a knockout semi-finals.[24]\\r\\nIn July 2015, FA's head of women's leagues and competitions, Katy Brazier, announced the long-term plan to have 24 teams play in the WSL.[17]\\r\\nFollowing a review, the FA announced in September 2017 that a restructuring of the league and its licensing criteria will follow from the 2017ÿ18 season. This will result in a fully professional top division of between 8 and 14 teams, and a second division of up to 12 semi-professional teams.[25]\\r\\nThe FA had intended to confirm a title sponsor by summer 2010, but failed to do so.[18] In November 2010, however, the FA's project manager said that the WSL was \\"building up a family of commercial partners.\\"[20] Days before the competition began, Yorkshire Building Society and Continental Tyres were named as two of a proposed four \\"Lead Partners\\".[26] Only Continental remained a lead partner for 2012.[27] In 2013, it was announced that Continental had extended their partnership as the exclusive partner of the FA's new commercial programme from 2014 to 2018 and includes the England women's national football team, FA Women's Cup and the FA WSL Continental Cup in addition to the WSL.[28][29]\\r\\nIn September 2017, it was announced that live games of the 2017ÿ18 season will be broadcast on television by BT Sport (a league sponsor) and online by the BBC and the league's Facebook page. Live commentary is broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live.[30]\\r\\nOn 8 December 2009, the FA and ESPN agreed an exclusive four year broadcast rights deal for television coverage of the WSL.[31] Six live matches were shown in 2011 in addition to a weekly highlights package, with 10 games expected to be shown in 2012.[22] ESPN televised the opening game of the WSL between Chelsea and Arsenal at Imperial Fields, Morden on 13 April 2011, a game Arsenal won 1ÿ0 with a first half goal by Gilly Flaherty.

Such an emergency was declared in India in 1962 (China war), 1971 (Pakistan war), and 1975 (declared by Indira Gandhi). The President can declare such an emergency only on the basis of a written request by the Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister. Such a proclamation must be laid before both houses of Parliament, and the state of emergency expires after one month unless approved within that time by both houses sitting and voting separately. However, if the Lok Sabha (the lower house) is not in session when the state of emergency is declared, and the Rajya Sabha approves of the state of emergency, the deadline for the Lok Sabha is extended until thirty days after that house convenes. According to Article 352(6),[1] approval by each house requires a special majority: those in favour of the motion must be two thirds of those present and voting, and amount to a majority of the entire membership of that house. A Parliamentary resolution extends the state of emergency for up to six months, and it can be extended indefinitely by further resolutions in six-monthly increments.\\r\\nDuring a national emergency, many Fundamental Rights of Indian citizens can be suspended. The six freedoms under Right to Freedom are automatically suspended. By contrast, the Right to Life and Personal Liberty cannot be suspended according to the original Constitution. In January 1977, during the emergency declared controversially by Indira Gandhi, the government decided to suspend even the Right to Life and Personal Liberty by dispensing with Habeas corpus. Justice Hans Raj Khanna defended the Right to Life and asked: \\"Life is also mentioned in Article 21 and would Government argument extend to it also?\\". The Attorney General observed: \\"Even if life was taken away illegally, courts are helpless\\".[2]\\r\\nA national emergency modifies the federal system of government to a unitary one by granting Parliament the power to make laws on the 66 subjects of the State List (which contains subjects on which the state governments can make laws). Also, all state money bills are referred to the Parliament for its approval.\\r\\nDuring an emergency, the term of the Lok Sabha can be successively extended by intervals of up to one year, but not beyond six months after the state of emergency has been revoked.\\r\\nA state emergency is declared on failure of constitutional machinery in a state. Every state in India except two states, Chhattisgarh and Telangana has been under a state of emergency at some point of time or the other. The state of emergency is commonly known as 'President's Rule'.[citation needed]\\r\\nIf the President is satisfied, based on the report of the Governor of the concerned state or from other sources, that the governance in a state cannot be carried out according to the provisions in the Constitution, he may declare an emergency in the state. Such an emergency must be approved by the Parliament within a period of two months.\\r\\nIt is imposed for an initial period of six months and can last for a maximum period of three years with repeated parliamentary approval every six months. The 42nd amendment act of 1976 extended the initial time duration of state emergency from 6 months to 1 year. Subsequently, 44th CAA 1978 restored the 1-year period back to 6 months. Originally, the maximum period of operation of state emergency was 3 years. This 3-year period was divided into 1 year of ordinary period and 2 years of extra ordinary period for which certain conditions are to be fulfilled. Therefore, from now on after every 1 year Parliament needs to approve the same. If the emergency has to be extended for more than three years, it can only be done by a constitutional amendment, as has happened in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.\\r\\nDuring such an emergency, the President can take over the entire work of the executive, and the Governor administers the state in the name of the President. the Legislative Assembly can be dissolved or may remain in suspended animation. The Parliament makes laws on the 66 subjects of the state list (see National emergency for explanation). All money bills have to be referred to the Parliament for approval. In this occasion ministers of state legislature do not perform actions in state.\\r\\nIf the President is satisfied that there is an economic situation in which the financial stability or credit of India is threatened, he or she can declare financial emergency. Such an emergency must be approved by the Parliament within two months. It has never been declared. Such a situation had arisen but was avoided by putting the gold assets of India as collateral for foreign credit.\\r\\nIn case of a financial emergency, the President can reduce the salaries of all government officials, including judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. All money bills passed by the State legislatures are submitted to the President for his approval. He can direct the state to observe certain principles (economy measures) relating to financial matters; but fundamental rights cannot be suspended.","input":"How many times did the president of india declare national emergency?"},{"output":"1973ÿ74","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Volkswagen Type 181 is a two-wheel drive, four-door, convertible, manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen from 1968 to 1983. Originally developed for the West German Army, the Type 181 was also sold to the public, as the Kurierwagen in West Germany, the Trekker (RHD Type 182) in the United Kingdom, the Thing in the United States (1973ÿ74), the Safari in Mexico and South America, and Pescaccia in Italy.  Civilian sales ended after model year 1980.\\r\\n\\r\\nManufactured in Wolfsburg, West Germany (1968ÿ74), Hannover, West Germany (1974ÿ83), Puebla, Mexico (1970ÿ80), and Jakarta, Indonesia (1973ÿ80), the Type 181 shared its mechanicals with Volkswagen's Type 1 (Beetle) and the pre-1968 Volkswagen Microbus, its floor pan with the Type 1 Karmann Ghia, and its concept with the company's Kbelwagen, which had been used by the German military during World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, several European governments began cooperating on development of a vehicle known as the Europa Jeep, a lightweight, amphibious four-wheel drive vehicle that could be mass-produced for use by various national military and government groups. \\r\\nDevelopment of the vehicle proved time-consuming, however, and the West German government was in need of a limited number of light, inexpensive, durable transport vehicles that could fulfill their basic needs while the Europa Jeep was being developed and put into production.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Volkswagen had been approached during the 1950s about building such a vehicle, and had subsequently passed on the proposition, the then-current management of the company saw the project as having some amount of potential as a consumer vehicle; Mexican customers were asking for something that could handle rural roads better than the Type 1, which was a large seller in Mexico at the time, and the popularity of VW-based dune buggies within the U.S. made executives think that a durable, fun, off-road-capable vehicle would become attractive to many buyers. \\r\\nVW could keep cost to a minimum and thus maximize profitability by using existing parts. \\r\\n\\r\\nLike the World War II era Type 82 Kbelwagen, the Type 181 used mechanical parts and a rear-engine platform, manual transmission and a flat-4 engine derived from that of the Type 1. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe floorpans came from the Type 1 Karmann Ghia, which had a wider floorpan than the Beetle. \\r\\nRear swing axle suspension with reduction gearing from the discontinued split-screen Volkswagen Transporter was used until 1973, when it was replaced with double-jointed axles used by Porsche and IRS semi-trailing arm setup as used on the 1303 and US-spec Beetles.\\r\\n\\r\\nCivilian sales began in mainland Europe and Mexico during 1971; in the U.S. in 1972; and briefly in Britain in 1975, where it failed to sell well and was dropped fairly quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe model was dropped from the American lineup for 1975 as it failed to meet new, stricter US safety standards. The Type 181 was reclassified as a passenger vehicle, and thus subject to stricter safety standards. The Windshield Intrusion Rule of the 1975 DOT standard called for a greater distance between the front seat occupants and the front window glass.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Europa Jeep was the result of a NATO plan to have a vehicle whereby each European NATO makers all combined to build a light-duty patrol vehicle. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Volkswagen 181 was only supposed to fill in, until the time that the Europa Jeep was ready. From 1968 until 1979, over 50,000 Type 181s were delivered to the NATO forces. \\r\\nBy 1979 the Europa Jeep project had fallen apart completely and was abandoned, and the West German government began supplementing their consumption of 181s with the new front-engined Type 183 Iltis.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the West German government's switch to the Type 183, European and Mexican sales of the civilian 181 continued through 1980, and several organizations, including NATO, continued to purchase military-spec Type 181 units through 1983, finding their reliability and low purchase and maintenance costs attractive.\\r\\n\\r\\nMilitary 181s attain a higher ride height and lower effective gearing by using reduction boxes, a form of portal axles.  181s without reduction boxes feature a transmission similar to the Beetle but with a slower gearing by use of different ring and pinion gears and have stronger, more flexible CV axles. Most mechanical parts are interchangeable with those of other VW models. Optional dual oil bath air cleaners increased filtering ability in dusty environments, and low noise ignition systems were fitted to military cars to be used for radio communication.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engine is a 4-cylinder rear mounted petrol engine.\\r\\n\\r\\n TV show Rizzoli & Isles, Season 5, Episode 14 \\"Foot Loose\\"","input":"What years did they make the volkswagen thing?"},{"output":"never been known with any precision","context":"The Rockefeller family (/?r?k?f?l?r/) is an American industrial, political, and banking family that owns one of the world's largest fortunes. The fortune was initially made in the US petroleum industry during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by John D. Rockefeller and his brother William Rockefeller, primarily through Standard Oil.[1] The family is also known for its long association with, and control of, Chase Manhattan Bank.[2] The Rockefellers are considered to be[who?] one of the most powerful families, if not the most powerful family,[3] in the history of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the founding members of the Rockefeller family was businessman William Rockefeller Sr. born in Granger, New York, to a Protestant family. He had six children with his first wife Eliza Davison, the most prominent of which were oil tycoons John Davison Rockefeller and William Rockefeller, co-founders of Standard Oil. Oil baron John D. Rockefeller was a devout Northern Baptist, and he supported many church-based institutions.[4][5][6]\\r\\nThe family was heavily involved in numerous real estate construction projects in the U.S. during the 20th century.[7] Chief among them:\\r\\nBeginning with John D. Rockefeller Sr., the family has been a major force in land conservation.[14] Over the generations, it has created more than 20 national parks and open spaces, including the Cloisters, Acadia National Park, Forest Hill Park, the Nature Conservancy, the Rockefeller Forest in California's Humboldt Redwoods State Park (the largest stand of old-growth redwoods), and Grand Teton National Park, among many others. John Jr., and his son Laurance (and his son Laurance Jr. aka Larry) were particularly prominent in this area.\\r\\nThe family was honored for its conservation efforts in November 2005, by the National Audubon Society, one of America's largest and oldest conservation organizations, at which over 30 family members attended. At the event, the society's president, John Flicker, notably stated: \\"Cumulatively, no other family in America has made the contribution to conservation that the Rockefeller family has made\\".[14]\\r\\nIn 2016 fifth-generation descendants of John Sr. criticized ExxonMobil, one of the successors to his company Standard Oil, for their record on climate change. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Family Fund both backed reports suggesting that ExxonMobil knew more about the threat of global warming than it had disclosed. David Kaiser, grandson of David Rockefeller Sr. and president of the Rockefeller Family Fund, said that the \\"...company seems to be morally bankrupt.\\" Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, daughter of former Senator Jay Rockefeller, said, \\"Because the source of the family wealth is fossil fuels, we feel an enormous moral responsibility for our children, for everyone -- to move forward.\\"[15]\\r\\nProminent banker and philanthropist David Rockefeller Sr. was the family patriarch until his death in 2017. In 1960, when his brother Nelson Rockefeller was governor of New York, David Sr. successfully pressed for a repeal of a New York state law that restricted Chase Manhattan Bank from operating outside the city. David Jr. was twice offered the post of Treasury secretary by President Richard M. Nixon, but declined on both occasions. In 1979, he used his high-level contacts to bring Mohammad Reza Shah of Iran, who had been overthrown in the Iranian Revolution and was in poor health, for medical treatment in the United States. In 1998, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton for his work on International Executive Service Corps.[16]\\r\\nThe Rockefeller Archive Center, an independent foundation that was until 2008 a division of Rockefeller University,[17] is a three-level underground archive below the Martha Baird Rockefeller Hillcrest house on the family estate at Pocantico (see Kykuit). Along forty-foot-long walls of shelves on rails, maintained by ten full-time archivists, is the entire repository of personal and official papers and correspondence of the complete family and its members, along with historical papers of its numerous foundations, as well as other non-family philanthropic institutions. These include: the Commonwealth Fund, Charles E. Culpeper Foundation, Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust, and the John and Mary R. Markle Foundation.\\r\\nIn total, it holds over 70 million pages of documents and contains the collections of forty-two scientific, cultural, educational and philanthropic organizations.\\r\\nOnly the expurgated records of deceased family members are publicly available to scholars and researchers; all records pertaining to living members are closed to historians. However, as Nelson Rockefeller's researcher, Cary Reich, discovered, in the case of Nelson's voluminous 3,247 cubic feet (91.9?m3) of papers, only about one-third of these files had been processed and released to researchers up to 1996. He reports that it will be many years before all the papers will be open to the public, despite Nelson's having died in 1979.[18]\\r\\nThe Center maintains that this repository of records, covering 140-plus years of the records of the family, in addition to non-Rockefeller philanthropic collections, gives unique insights into United States and world issues and social developments in both the 19th and 20th centuries.\\r\\nRecords in the collection are available up until only the early 1960s, generally 1961. Major subjects in the collection include:\\r\\nThe combined wealth of the family ÿ their total assets and investments plus the individual wealth of its members ÿ has never been known with any precision. The records of the family archives relating to both the family and individual members' net worth are closed to researchers.[20]\\r\\nFrom the outset, and even today, the family's wealth has been under the complete control of the male members of the dynasty, through the family office. Despite strong-willed wives who had influence over their husbands' decisionssuch as the pivotal female figure Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, wife of Juniorin all cases they received allowances only and were never given even partial responsibility for the family fortune.[21]\\r\\nMuch of the wealth has been locked up in the notable family trust of 1934 (which holds the bulk of the fortune and matures on the death of the fourth generation), and the trust of 1952, both administered by Chase Bank, the corporate successor to Chase Manhattan Bank. These trusts have consisted of shares in the successor companies to Standard Oil and other diversified investments, as well as the family's considerable real estate holdings. They are administered by a trust committee that oversees the fortune.\\r\\nManagement of this fortune today also rests with professional money managers who oversee the principal holding company, Rockefeller Financial Services, which controls all the family's investments, now that Rockefeller Center is no longer owned by the family. The present chairman is David Rockefeller Jr.\\r\\nIn 1992, it had five main arms:\\r\\nIn September 2014, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund announced it will divest its investments in fossil fuel companies.[23] In March 2015, the chair of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund stated two conclusions, one that; \\"its immoral to continue down the fossil fuel path\\", and secondly that it is \\"financially imprudent to stay invested in companies whose profits depend on defying ... the international effort to restrain climate change.\\"[24]\\r\\nOver the generations the family members have resided in some notable historic homes. A total of 81 Rockefeller homes are on the National Register of Historic Places.[25] Not including all homes owned by the five brothers, some of the more prominent of these are:\\r\\nA trademark of the dynasty over its 140-plus years has been the remarkable unity it has maintained, despite major divisions that developed in the late 1970s, and unlike other wealthy families such as the Du Ponts and the Mellons. A primary reason has been the lifelong efforts of \\"Junior\\" to not only cleanse the name from the opprobrium stemming from the ruthless practices of Standard Oil, but his tireless efforts to forge family unity even as he allowed his five sons to operate independently. This was partly achieved by regular brothers and family meetings, but it was also because of the high value placed on family unity by first Nelson and John III, and later especially with David.[26]\\r\\nRegarding achievements, in 1972, on the 100th anniversary of the founding of Andrew Carnegie's philanthropy, the Carnegie Corporation, which has had a long association with the family and its institutions, released a public statement on the influence of the family on not just philanthropy but encompassing a much wider field. Summing up a predominant view amongst the international philanthropic world, albeit one poorly grasped by the public, one sentence of this statement read: \\"The contributions of the Rockefeller family are staggering in their extraordinary range and in the scope of their contribution to humankind.\\"[27]\\r\\nJohn D. Rockefeller gave away US$540 million over his lifetime (in dollar terms of that time), and became the greatest lay benefactor of medicine in history.[28] His son, \\"Junior,\\" also gave away over $537 million over his lifetime, bringing the total philanthropy of just two generations of the family to over $1 billion from 1860 to 1960.[29] Added to this, the New York Times declared in a report in November 2006 that David Rockefeller's total charitable benefactions amount to about $900 million over his lifetime.[30]\\r\\nThe combined personal and social connections of the various family members are vast, both in America and throughout the world, including the most powerful politicians, royalty, public figures, and chief businessmen. Notable figures through Standard Oil alone have included Henry Flagler and Henry H. Rogers. Contemporary figures include Henry Kissinger, Richard Parsons (Chairman and CEO of Time Warner), C. Fred Bergsten, Peter G. Peterson (Senior Chairman of the Blackstone Group), and Paul Volcker.\\r\\nIn 1991 the family was presented with the Honor Award from the National Building Museum for four generations worth of preserving and creating some of the U.S.'s most important buildings and places. David accepted the award on the family's behalf.[31] The ceremony coincided with an exhibition on the family's contributions to the built environment, including John Sr.'s preservation efforts for the Hudson River Palisades, the restoration of Williamsburg, Virginia, construction of Rockefeller Center, and Governor Nelson's efforts to construct low- and middle-income housing in New York state.[32]\\r\\nThe Rockefeller name is imprinted in numerous places throughout the United States, most notably in New York City, but also in Cleveland, where the family originates:\\r\\nJohn Jr., through his son Nelson, purchased and then donated the land upon which sits the United Nations headquarters, in New York, in 1946. Earlier, in the 1920s, he had also donated a substantial amount towards the restoration and rehabilitation of major buildings in France after World War I, such as the Rheims Cathedral, the Fontainebleau Palace and the Palace of Versailles, for which he was later (1936) awarded France's highest decoration, the Grand Croix of the Legion d'Honneur (subsequently also awarded decades later to his son, David Rockefeller).\\r\\nHe also funded the notable excavations at Luxor in Egypt, as well as establishing a Classical Studies School in Athens. In addition, he provided the funding for the construction of the Palestine Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem - the Rockefeller Museum.[34]\\r\\nThe members of the Rockefeller family are noted for their philanthropy; a Rockefeller Archive Center study in 2004 documents an incomplete list of 72 major institutions that the family has created and/or endowed up to the present day. Historically, the major focus of their benefactions have been in the educational, health and conservation areas.\\r\\nFamily leaders in both philanthropy and business have included John D. Sr., John D. Jr. (\\"Junior\\"), John D. III, Laurance, and David. Several family members have held high public office, including Vice President of the United States (Nelson Rockefeller), United States Senator (Jay Rockefeller), state governor (Nelson, Jay, and Winthrop Rockefeller), and lieutenant governor (Winthrop Paul Rockefeller). Another noted family member was Michael Rockefeller, son of Nelson Rockefeller, an anthropologist who came to media attention after he was presumed killed in New Guinea in 1961.\\r\\nThe corporate, financial, and personal affairs of the family - numbering around 150 blood relatives of John D. Rockefeller - are run from the family office, Room 5600, known officially as \\"Rockefeller Family and Associates\\". It comprises three floors of the GE Building in Rockefeller Center; all private family legal matters are handled by the family-associated New York law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. Room 5600 is also the base of the current family historian, Peter J. Johnson, who assisted with David Rockefeller's Memoirs, published in 2002.\\r\\nTo distinguish the generations and facilitate communication, the fourth generation is generically known as \\"The Cousins\\" (24 in all, with 21 still living) and the younger family members are known as the \\"Fifth/Sixth\\" generation. Many if not all of these family members are involved in institutionalised philanthropic pursuits. Family links are solidified through the practice of ritualised family meetings - which started with the regular \\"brothers' meetings\\" held in Room 5600 or in their respective private residences, beginning in 1945. Family get-togethers are held today at the \\"Playhouse\\", in the Westchester County family estate of Pocantico, in June (the \\"cousins weekend\\") and December of each year (see Kykuit).\\r\\nThe total number of blood relative descendants as of 2006 was about 150.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn article in the New York Times in 1937 stated that William Rockefeller had, at that time, 28 great-grandchildren.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWinthrop Paul Rockefeller","input":"How much money do the rockefellers still have?"},{"output":"68,400","context":"The National Football League is the largest live spectator sporting league in the world (excluding auto racing) in terms of average attendance.

The invasion was a direct, if delayed, response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece (492ÿ490 BC) at the Battle of Marathon, which ended Darius I's attempts to subjugate Greece. After Darius's death, his son Xerxes spent several years planning for the second invasion, mustering an enormous army and navy. The Athenians and Spartans led the Greek resistance. About a tenth of the Greek city-states joined the 'Allied' effort; most remained neutral or submitted to Xerxes.\\r\\nThe invasion began in spring 480 BC, when the Persian army crossed the Hellespont and marched through Thrace and Macedon to Thessaly. The Persian advance was blocked at the pass of Thermopylae by a small Allied force under King Leonidas I of Sparta; simultaneously, the Persian fleet was blocked by an Allied fleet at the straits of Artemisium. At the famous Battle of Thermopylae, the Allied army held back the Persian army for seven days, before they were outflanked by a mountain path and the Allied rearguard was trapped and annihilated. The Allied fleet had also withstood two days of Persian attacks at the Battle of Artemisium, but when news reached them of the disaster at Thermopylae, they withdrew to Salamis.\\r\\nAfter Thermopylae, all of Boeotia and Attica fell to the Persian army, which captured and burnt Athens. However, a larger Allied army fortified the narrow Isthmus of Corinth, protecting the Peloponnesus from Persian conquest. Both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter the course of the war. The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the Persian navy into the narrow Straits of Salamis, where the huge number of Persian ships became disorganised, and were soundly beaten by the Allied fleet. The Allied victory at Salamis prevented a quick conclusion to the invasion, and fearing becoming trapped in Europe, Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general Mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army.\\r\\nThe following spring, the Allies assembled the largest ever hoplite army, and marched north from the isthmus to confront Mardonius. At the ensuing Battle of Plataea, the Greek infantry again proved its superiority, inflicting a severe defeat on the Persians and killing Mardonius in the process. On the same day, across the Aegean Sea an Allied navy destroyed the remnants of the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale. With this double defeat, the invasion was ended, and Persian power in the Aegean severely dented. The Greeks would now move to the offensive, eventually expelling the Persians from Europe, the Aegean islands and Ionia before the war finally came to an end in 479 BC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main source for the Great Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian Herodotus. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',[3] was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (GreekHistoria; English(The) Histories) around 440ÿ430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).[4] Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.[4] As Holland has it: \\"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\\"[4]\\r\\nSome subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with Thucydides.[5][6] Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.[6] Plutarch criticised Herodotus in his essay \\"On The Malignity of Herodotus\\", describing Herodotus as \\"Philobarbaros\\" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.[7] A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.[8] However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds that have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.[9] The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.[9] Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.[10]\\r\\nThe Greek historian Diodorus Siculus from Sicily, writing in the 1st century BC in his Bibliotheca Historica, also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian Ephorus. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.[11] The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, Ctesias, and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright Aeschylus. Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column, also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.[12]\\r\\nThe Greek city-states of Athens and Eretria had supported the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499ÿ494 BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young, and prone to revolts among its subject peoples.[13][14] Moreover, Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.[13] The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire).[15][16] Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.[16] A preliminary expedition under Mardonius, in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to Greece ended with the re-conquest of Thrace and forced Macedon to become a fully subordinate kingdom part of Persia.[17][18] It had previously been a vassal as early as the late 6th century BC, but remained having autonomy and not fully subordinate yet.[18]\\r\\nIn 491 BC, Darius sent emissaries to all the Greek city-states, asking for a gift of 'earth and water' in token of their submission to him.[19] Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well.[19] This meant that Sparta was also now effectively at war with Persia.[19]\\r\\nDarius thus put together an ambitious task force under Datis and Artaphernes in 490 BC, which attacked Naxos, before receiving the submission of the other Cycladic Islands. The task force then moved on Eretria, which it besieged and destroyed.[20] Finally, it moved to attack Athens, landing at the bay of Marathon, where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army. At the ensuing Battle of Marathon, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.[21]\\r\\nDarius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.[14] Darius then died while preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I.[22] Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.[23]\\r\\nSince this was to be a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription.[23] It was decided that Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges were to be set up to allow his army to cross the Hellespont to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC).[24] These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state.[24] However, the campaign was delayed one year because of another revolt in Egypt and Babylonia.[25]\\r\\nIn 481 BC, after roughly four years of preparation, Xerxes began to muster the troops for the invasion of Europe. Herodotus gives the names of 46 nations from which troops were drafted.[26] The Persian army was gathered in Asia Minor in the summer and autumn of 481 BC. The armies from the Eastern satrapies was gathered in Kritala, Cappadocia and were led by Xerxes to Sardis where they passed the winter.[27] Early in spring it moved to Abydos where it was joined with the armies of the western satrapies.[28] Then the army that Xerxes had mustered marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.[29]\\r\\nThe numbers of troops that Xerxes mustered for the second invasion of Greece have been the subject of endless dispute, because the numbers given in ancient sources are very large indeed. Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.5 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel.[30] The poet Simonides, who was a contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias, based on Persian records, gave 800,000 as the total number of the army (without the support personnel) that was assembled by Xerxes.[31] While it has been suggested that Herodotus or his sources had access to official Persian Empire records of the forces involved in the expedition, modern scholars tend to reject these figures based on knowledge of the Persian military systems, their logistical capabilities, the Greek countryside, and supplies available along the army's route.[1]\\r\\nModern scholars thus generally attribute the numbers given in the ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors, or disinformation by the Persians in the run up to the war.[2] The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300,000ÿ500,000.[1][2] Nevertheless, whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea,[1] and also that much of the army died of starvation and disease, never returning to Asia.[32]\\r\\nHerodotus tells us that the army and navy, while moving through Thrace, was halted at Doriskos for an inspection by Xerxes, and he recounts the numbers of troops found to be present:[33]\\r\\nHerodotus doubles this number to account for support personnel and thus he reports that the whole army numbered 5,283,220 men.[30] Other ancient sources give similarly large numbers. The poet Simonides, who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias gave 800,000 as the total number of the army that assembled in Doriskos.[31]\\r\\nAn early and very influential modern historian, George Grote, set the tone by expressing incredulity at the numbers given by Herodotus: \\"To admit this overwhelming total, or anything near to it, is obviously impossible.\\"[67] Grote's main objection is the supply problem, though he does not analyse the problem in detail. He did not reject Herodotus's account altogether, citing the latter's reporting of the Persians' careful methods of accounting and their stockpiling of supply caches for three years, but drew attention to the contradictions in the ancient sources.[67] A later influential historian, J. B. Bury, calls Herodotus's numbers \\"wholly fabulous\\" and judges that the Persian land forces may have been 180,000.[68] A major limiting factor for the size of the Persian army, first suggested by Sir Frederick Maurice (a British transport officer) is the supply of water.[69] Maurice suggested in the region of 200,000 men and 70,000 animals could have been supported by the rivers in that region of Greece. He further suggested that Herodotus may have confused the Persian terms for chiliarchy (1,000) and myriarchy (10,000), leading to an exaggeration by a factor of ten.[69] Other early modern scholars estimated that the land forces participating in the invasion at 100,000 soldiers or less, based on the logistical systems available to the Ancients.[70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77]\\r\\nMunro and Macan note Herodotus giving the names of six major commanders and 29 myriarchs (leaders of a baivabaram, the basic unit of the Persian infantry, which numbered about 10,000-strong[78][79]); this would give a land force of roughly 300,000 men.[80][81] Other proponents of larger numbers suggest figures from 250,000 to 700,000.[82][83]\\r\\nThe size of the Persian fleet is also disputed, though perhaps less so.[84] According to Herodotus the Persian fleet numbered 1,207 triremes and 3,000 transport and supply ships, including 50-oared galleys (Penteconters) (Ұ?).[37] Herodotus gives a detailed breakdown of the Persian triremes:\\r\\nHerodotus also records that this was the number at the Battle of Salamis, despite the losses earlier in storms off Sepia and Euboea, and at the battle of Artemisium. He claims that the losses were replenished with reinforcements, though he only records 120 triremes from the Greeks of Thrace and an unspecified number of ships from the Greek islands. Aeschylus, who fought at Salamis, also claims that he faced 1,207 warships there, of which 1,000 were triremes and 207 fast ships.[85] Diodorus [86] and Lysias[87] independently claim there were 1,200 at Doriskos. The number of 1,207 (for the outset only) is also given by Ephorus,[88] while his teacher Isocrates claims there were 1,300 at Doriskos and 1,200 at Salamis.[89][90] Ctesias gives another number, 1,000 ships,[31] while Plato, speaking in general terms refers to 1,000 ships and more.[91]\\r\\nThese numbers are (by ancient standards) consistent, and this could be interpreted that a number around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars some have accepted this number, although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis.[92][93][94] Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliadand generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.[94][95][96]\\r\\nThe Athenians had been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the politician Themistocles, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians.[97] The Athenians did not have the man-power to fight on land and sea; therefore combatting the Persians would require an alliance of several Greek city states. In 481 BC Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta.[98] Support thus began to coalesce around these two states.\\r\\nA congress of states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed.[99] This confederation had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. Herodotus does not formulate an abstract name for the union but simply calls them \\"? ??\\" (the Greeks) and \\"the Greeks who had sworn alliance\\" (Godley translation) or \\"the Greeks who had banded themselves together\\" (Rawlinson translation).[100] Hereafter, they will be referred to as the 'Allies'. Sparta and Athens had a leading role in the congress but interests of all the states played a part in determining defensive strategy.[101] Little is known about the internal workings of the congress or the discussions during its meetings. Only 70 of the approximately 700 Greek cities sent representatives. Nevertheless, this was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.[102]\\r\\nThe majority of other city-states remained more-or-less neutral, awaiting the outcome of the confrontation.[103] Thebes was a major absentee, and was suspected of being willing to aid the Persians once the invasion force arrived.[103][104] Not all Thebans agreed with this policy, and 400 \\"loyalist\\" hoplites joined the Allied force at Thermopylae (at least according to one possible interpretation).[104] The most notable city actively siding with the Persians (\\"Medised\\") was Argos, in the otherwise Spartan-dominated Peloponnese.[105][106] However, the Argives had been severely weakened in 494 BC, when a Spartan-force led by Cleomenes I had annihilated the Argive army in Battle of Sepeia and then massacred the fugitives.[106]\\r\\nThe allies had no 'standing army', nor was there any requirement to form one; since they were fighting on home territory, they could muster armies as and when required. Different-sized allied forces thus appeared throughout the campaign. These numbers are discussed fully in the article for each battle.\\r\\nHaving crossed into Europe in April 480 BC, the Persian army began its march to Greece. Five major food depots had been set up along the path: at White Headland on the Thracian side of the Hellespont, at Tyrodiza in Perinthian territory, at Doriskos at the Evros river estuary where the Asian army was linked up with the Balkan allies, at Eion on the Strymon river, and at Therme, modern-day Thessaloniki. There, food had been sent from Asia for several years in preparation for the campaign. Animals had been bought and fattened, while the local populations had, for several months, been ordered to grind the grains into flour.[107] The Persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme, a journey of about 600?km (360 mi). It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet. Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.[108]\\r\\nThe Allied 'congress' met again in the spring of 480 BC. A Thessalian delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes's advance.[109] A force of 10,000 Allies led by the Spartan polemarch Euenetus and Themistocles was thus despatched to the pass. However, once there, they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed by at least two other passes, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming; the Allies therefore retreated.[110] Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.[110] The abandonment of Tempe meant that all of Thessaly submitted to the Persians, as did many cities to the north of the pass of Thermopylae when it seemed help was not forthcoming.[111]\\r\\nA second strategy was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress.[112] However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.[113]\\r\\nWhen the Allies received the news that Xerxes was clearing paths around Mount Olympus, and thus intending to march towards Thermopylae, it was both the period of truce that accompanied the Olympic games, and the Spartan festival of Carneia, during both of which warfare was considered sacrilegious.[114] Nevertheless, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they despatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men (in this case, the elite young soldiers in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had sons).[114] Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Peloponnesian cities allied to Sparta, and other forces that were picked up en route to Thermopylae.[114] The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.[115]\\r\\nWhen the Persians arrived at Thermopylae in mid-August, they initially waited for three days for the Allies to disperse. When Xerxes was eventually persuaded that the Allies intended to contest the pass, he sent his troops to attack.[116] However, the Greek position was ideally suited to hoplite warfare, the Persian contingents being forced to attack the phalanx head on.[117] The Allies thus withstood two full days of battle and everything Xerxes could throw at them. However, at the end of the second day, they were betrayed by a local resident named Ephialtes who revealed to Xerxes a mountain path that led behind the Allied lines. Xerxes then sent his elite guards, the Immortals on a night march to outflank the Allied. When he was made aware of this maneuver (while the Immortals were still en route), Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Allied army, remaining to guard the rear with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebians and perhaps a few hundred others. On the third day of the battle, the remaining Allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians and slaughter as many as they could.[118] Ultimately, however, the Allied rearguard was annihilated, and the pass of Thermopylae opened to the Persians.[119]\\r\\nSimultaneous with the battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians.[120] Directly before Artemisium, the Persian fleet had been caught in a gale off the coast of Magnesia, losing many ships, but could still probably muster over 800 ships at the start of the battle.[121] On the first day (also the first of the Battle of Thermopylae), the Persians detached 200 seaworthy ships, which were sent to sail around the eastern coast of Euboea. These ships were to round Euboea and block the line of retreat for the Allied fleet.[121] Meanwhile, the Allies and the remaining Persians engaged in the late afternoon, the Allies having the better of the engagement and capturing 30 vessels.[121] That evening, another storm occurred, wrecking the majority of the Persian detachment which had been sent around Euboea.[122]\\r\\nOn the second day of the battle, news reached the Allies that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened; they therefore resolved to maintain their position. They staged a hit-and-run attack on some Cilician ships, capturing and destroying them.[123] On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked the Allies lines in full force. In a day of savage fighting, the Allies held on to their position, but suffered severe losses[124] (half the Athenian fleet was damaged[125]); nevertheless, the Allies inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet.[124] That evening, the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allies at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.[126]\\r\\nVictory at Thermopylae meant that all Boeotia fell to Xerxes; the two cities that had resisted him, Thespiae and Plataea, were captured and razed. Attica was also left open to invasion, and the remaining population of Athens was thus evacuated, with the aid of the Allied fleet, to Salamis.[127] The Peloponnesian Allies began to prepare a defensive line across the Isthmus of Corinth, building a wall, and demolishing the road from Megara, thereby abandoning Athens to the Persians.[128] Athens thus fell; the small number of Athenians who had barricaded themselves on the Acropolis were eventually defeated, and Xerxes then ordered Athens to be torched.[129]\\r\\nThe Persians had now captured most of Greece, but Xerxes had perhaps not expected such defiance from the Greeks; his priority was now to complete the war as quickly as possible;[130] the huge invasion force could not be supplied indefinitely, and probably Xerxes did not wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long.[131] Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position had little chance of success;[132] with the Allies now dug in across the isthmus, there was therefore little chance of the Persians conquering the rest of Greece by land. However, if the isthmus's defensive line could be outflanked, the Allies could be defeated.[133][134] Such an outflanking of the isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the neutralisation of the Allied navy.[131][134] In summary, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season.[131] Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by destroying the Persian fleet, the Greeks could avoid conquest. In the final reckoning, both sides were prepared to stake everything on a naval battle, in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war.[135]\\r\\nThus it was that the Allied fleet remained off the coast of Salamis into September, despite the imminent arrival of the Persians. Even after Athens fell to the advancing Persian army, the Allied fleet still remained off the coast of Salamis, trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle.[135][136] Partly as a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the navies finally engaged in the cramped Straits of Salamis.[132] There, the large Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to manoeuvre and became disorganised.[137] Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet attacked, and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships, and thus ensuring the Peloponnesus would not be outflanked.[138]\\r\\nAccording to Herodotus, after this loss Xerxes attempted to build a causeway across the straits to attack Salamis (although Strabo and Ctesias place this attempt before the battle). In any case this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Greeks might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges.[139] According to Herodotus, Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while advising Xerxes to retreat to Asia with the bulk of the army.[140] All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly.[130] The Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.[130]\\r\\nHerodotus tells us that a Persian general, Artabazus, having escorted Xerxes to the Hellespont with 60,000 men, began the return journey to Mardonius in Thessaly.[141] However, as he neared Pallene,\\r\\n\\"he thought it right that he should enslave the people of Potidaea, whom he found in revolt.\\"\\r\\nDespite attempts to capture the Greek city by treachery,[142] the Persians were forced to keep up the siege for three months.[143] Then, attempting to use an unusually low tide to attack the town from sea, the Persian army was caught by the returning tide, many drowning and the survivors being attacked by the Potideans in boats.[143] Artabazus was thus forced to lift the siege, and return to Mardonius with the remnants of his men.[143]\\r\\nWhile besieging Potidea, Artabazus also decided to besiege Olynthus, which was also in revolt.[144] The town was held by the Bottiaean tribe, who had been driven out of Macedon.[144] Having taken the town, he massacred the defenders, and handed over the town to the Chalcidian people.[144]\\r\\nOver the winter, there seems to have been some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not protected by the isthmus, but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year.[145] When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring.[146] The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle.[146] Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.[145]\\r\\nMardonius moved to break the stalemate, by offering peace, self-government and territorial expansion to the Athenians (with the aim of thereby removing their fleet from the Allied forces), using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediary.[146] The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the offer, but rejected it.[146] Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it.[146] Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, along with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the Persian terms if not.[147] The Spartans, who were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus, delayed making a decision for 10 days.[148] However, when the Athenian emissaries then delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans, they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already marching to meet the Persians.[149]\\r\\nWhen Mardonius heard that the Allied army was on the march, he retreated into Boeotia, near Plataea, trying to draw the Allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry.[150] The Allied army however, under the command of the Spartan regent Pausanias, stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect themselves against such tactics.[151] Mardonius ordered a hit-and-run cavalry attack on the Greek lines,[152] but the attack was unsuccessful and the cavalry commander killed.[153] The outcome prompted the Allies to move to a position nearer the Persian camp, still on high ground.[154] As a result, the Allied lines of communication were exposed. The Persian cavalry began to intercept food deliveries and finally managed to destroy the only spring of water available to the Allies.[151] The Allied position now undermined, Pausanias ordered a night-time retreat towards their original positions.[151] This went awry, leaving the Athenians, and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills, with the other contingents scattered further away, near Plataea itself.[151] Seeing that he might never have a better opportunity to attack, Mardonius ordered his whole army forward.[155][156] However, as at Thermopylae, the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites,[157] and the Spartans broke through to Mardonius's bodyguard and killed him.[158] The Persian force thus dissolved in rout; 40,000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly,[159] but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Allies, thus finalising their victory.[156][160]\\r\\nOn the afternoon of the Battle of Plataea, Herodotus tells us that rumour of the Allied victory reached the Allied navy, at that time off the coast of Mount Mycale in Ionia.[161] Their morale boosted, the Allied marines fought and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mycale that same day, destroying the remnants of the Persian fleet.[162] As soon as the Peloponnesians had marched north of the isthmus, the Athenian fleet under Xanthippus had joined up with the rest of the Allied fleet.[162] The fleet, now able to match the Persians, had first sailed to Samos, where the Persian fleet was based.[163] The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting, and instead drew their ships up on the beach under Mycale. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes, and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships.[163] However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines.[162] Seeing the small size of the Allied force, the Persians emerged from the camp, but the hoplites again proved superior, and destroyed much of the Persian force.[162] The ships were abandoned to the Allies, who burnt them, crippling Xerxes' sea power, and marking the ascendancy of the Allied fleet.[162]\\r\\nWith the twin victories of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, the threat of future invasion was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again, over time it became apparent that the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished.[164]\\r\\nIn many ways Mycale represents the start of a new phase of the conflict, the Greek counterattack.[165] After the victory at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done.[166] The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians.[166] The Persians in the region, and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, which the Athenians then laid siege to; after a protracted siege, it fell to the Athenians.[167] Herodotus ended his Historia after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia.[167] Peace with Persia came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare.[167]\\r\\nThe Greek style of warfare had been honed over the preceding centuries.[168][169] It revolved around the hoplite, members of the middle-classes (the zeugites) who could afford the armour necessary to fight in this manner.[170] The hoplite was, by the standards of the time, heavily armoured, with a breastplate (originally bronze, but probably by this stage a more flexible leather version), greaves, a full helmet, and a large round shield (the aspis).[169] Hoplites were armed with a long spear (the doru), which was evidently significantly longer than Persian spears, and a sword (the xiphos).[169] Hoplites fought in the phalanx formation; the exact details are not completely clear, but it was a close-knit formation, presenting a uniform front of overlapping shields, and spears, to the enemy.[168] Properly assembled, the phalanx was a formidable offensive and defensive weapon;[171][172] on occasions when it is recorded to have happened, it took a huge number of light infantry to defeat a relatively small phalanx.[171] The phalanx was vulnerable to being outflanked by cavalry, if caught on the wrong terrain, however.[173] The hoplite's heavy armour and long spears made them excellent troops in hand-to-hand combat[169] and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks by light troops and skirmishers. Even if the shield did not stop a missile, there was a reasonable chance the armour would.[169]\\r\\nThe Persian infantry used in the invasion were a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, there was at least a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting.[174] The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin.[174][175] The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scaled armour.[174] Some of the contingents may have been armed somewhat differently;[174] for instance, the Saka were renowned axemen.[176] The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, Medians, Cissians and the Saka.[174] The foremost of the infantry were the royal guards, the Immortals, although they were still armed in the aforementioned style.[174][177] Cavalry was provided by the Persians, Bactrians, Medes, Cissians and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry.[174][178] The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword.[174]\\r\\nThe Persians had encountered hoplites in battle before at Ephesus, where their cavalry had easily routed the (probably exhausted) Greeks.[179] However, at the battle of Marathon, the Athenian hoplites had shown their superiority over the Persian infantry, albeit in the absence of any cavalry.[180] It is therefore slightly surprising that the Persians did not bring any hoplites from the Greek regions, especially Ionia, under their control in Asia.[174] Equally, Herodotus tells us that the Egyptian marines serving in the navy were well armed, and performed well against the Greek marines; yet no Egyptian contingent served in the army.[169] The Persians may not have completely trusted the Ionians and Egyptians, since both had recently revolted against Persian rule. However, if this is the case, then it must be questioned why there were Greek and Egyptian contingents in the navy. The Allies evidently tried to play on the Persian fears about the reliability of the Ionians in Persian service;[181][182] but, as far as we can tell, both the Ionians and Egyptians performed particularly well for the Persian navy.[174] It may therefore simply be that neither the Ionians nor Egyptians were included in the army because they were serving in the fleet  none of the coastal regions of the Persian empire appear to have sent contingents with the army.[174]\\r\\nIn the two major land battles of the invasion, the Allies clearly adjusted their tactics to nullify the Persian advantage in numbers and cavalry, by occupying the pass at Thermopylae, and by staying on high ground at Plataea.[183] At Thermopylae, until the path outflanking the Allied position was revealed, the Persians signally failed to adjust their tactics to the situation, although the position was well chosen to limit the Persian options.[177][184] At Plataea, the harassing of the Allied positions by cavalry was a successful tactic, forcing the precipitous (and nearly disastrous) retreat; however, Mardonius then brought about a general melee between the infantry, which resulted in the Persian defeat.[185] The events at Mycale reveal a similar story; Persian infantry committing themselves to a melee with hoplites, with disastrous results.[162] It has been suggested that there is little evidence of complex tactics in the Greco-Persian wars.[186] However, as simple as the Greek tactics were, they played to their strengths; the Persians however, may have seriously underestimated the strength of the hoplite, and their failure to adapt to facing the Allied infantry contributed to the eventual Persian defeat.[174][186][186]\\r\\nAt the beginning of the invasion, it is clear that the Persians held most advantages.[187] Regardless of its actual size, it is clear that the Persians had brought an overwhelming number of troops and ships to Greece.[1][188] The Persians had a unified command system, and everyone was answerable to the king.[189] They had a hugely efficient bureaucracy, which allowed them to undertake remarkable feats of planning.[24][190][191] The Persian generals had significant experience of warfare over the 80 years in which the Persian empire had been established.[192] Furthermore, the Persians excelled in the use of intelligence and diplomacy in warfare, as shown by their (nearly successful) attempts to divide-and-conquer the Greeks.[193][194][195] The Greeks, by comparison, were fragmented, with only 30 or so city-states actively opposing the Persian invasion; even those were prone to quarrel with each other.[196] They had little experience of large-scale warfare, being largely restricted to small-scale local warfare,[197] and their commanders were chosen primarily on the basis of the political and social standing, rather than because of any experience or expertise.[198] As Lazenby therefore asks: \\"So why did the Persians fail?\\"[187]\\r\\nThe Persian strategy for 480 BC was probably to simply progress through Greece in overwhelming force.[185] The cities in any territory that the army passed through would be forced to submit or risk destruction; and indeed this happened with the Thessalian, Locrian and Phocian cities who initially resisted the Persians but then were forced to submit as the Persians advanced.[199][200] Conversely, the Allied strategy was probably to try and stop the Persian advance as far north as possible, and thus prevent the submission of as many potential Allies as possible.[187] Beyond this, the Allies seem to have realised that given the Persians' overwhelming numbers, they had little chance in open battle, and thus they opted to try to defend geographical bottle-necks, where the Persian numbers would count for less.[187] The whole Allied campaign for 480 BC can be seen in this context. Initially they attempted to defend the Tempe pass to prevent the loss of Thessaly.[187] After they realised that they could not defend this position, they chose the next-most northerly position, the Thermopylae/Artemisium axis.[187] The Allied performance at Thermopylae was initially effective; however, the failure to properly guard the path that outflanked Thermopylae undermined their strategy, and led to defeat.[187] At Artemisium the fleet also scored some successes, but withdrew due to the losses they had sustained, and since the defeat of Thermopylae made the position irrelevant.[201] Thus far, the Persian strategy had succeeded, while the Allied strategy, though not a disaster, had failed.\\r\\nThe defence of the Isthmus of Corinth by the Allies changed the nature of the war. The Persians did not attempt to attack the isthmus by land, realising they probably could not breach it.[202][203] This essentially reduced the conflict to a naval one.[187] Themistocles now proposed what was in hindsight the strategic masterstroke in the Allied campaign; to lure the Persian fleet to battle in the straits of Salamis.[187][204] However, as successful as this was, there was no need for the Persians to fight at Salamis to win the war; it has been suggested that the Persians were either overconfident, or overeager to finish the campaign.[187][205] Thus, the Allied victory at Salamis must at least partially be ascribed to a Persian strategic blunder.[187] After Salamis, the Persian strategy changed. Mardonius sought to exploit dissensions between the Allies in order to fracture the alliance.[185] In particular, he sought to win over the Athenians, which would leave the Allied fleet unable to oppose Persian landings on the Peloponnesus.[145] Although Herodotus tells us that Mardonius was keen to fight a decisive battle, his actions in the run-up to Plataea are not particularly consistent with this.[187] He seems to have been willing to accept battle on his terms, but he waited either for the Allies to attack, or for the alliance to collapse ignominiously.[187] The Allied strategy for 479 BC was something of a mess; the Peloponnesians only agreed to march north in order to save the alliance, and it appears that the Allied leadership had little idea how to force a battle that they could win.[187] It was the botched attempt to retreat from Plataea that finally delivered the Allies battle on their terms.[185] Mardonius may have been overeager for victory; there was no need to attack the Allies, and by doing so he played to the main Allied tactical strength, combat in the melee.[185] The Allied victory at Plataea can also therefore be seen as partially the result of a Persian mistake.[185]\\r\\nThus, the Persian failure may be seen partly as a result of two strategic mistakes that handed the Allies tactical advantages, and resulted in decisive defeats for the Persians.[185] The Allied success is often seen as the result of \\"free men fighting for their freedom\\".[206] This may have played a part, and certainly the Greeks seem to have interpreted their victory in those terms.[207] One crucial factor in the Allied success was that, having formed an alliance, however fractious, they remained true to it, despite the odds.[185] There appear to have been many occasions when the alliance seemed in doubt, but ultimately it withstood; and while this alone did not defeat the Persians, it meant that even after the occupation of most of Greece, the Allies were not themselves defeated.[187] This is exemplified by the remarkable fact that the citizens of Athens, Thespiae and Plataea chose to carry on fighting from exile rather than submit to the Persians.[208] Ultimately, the Allies succeeded because they avoided catastrophic defeats,[187] stuck to their alliance,[185] took advantage of Persian mistakes,[185] and because in the hoplite they possessed an advantage (perhaps their only real advantage at the start of the conflict), which, at Plataea, allowed them to destroy the Persian invasion force.[169]\\r\\nThe second Persian invasion of Greece was an event of major significance in European history. A large number of historians hold that, had Greece been conquered, the Ancient Greek culture that lies at the basis of Western civilization would have never developed (and by extension Western civilization itself).[209][210][211] While this may be an exaggeration, it is clear that even at the time the Greeks understood that something very significant had happened.[212]\\r\\nMilitarily, there was not much in the way of tactical or strategic innovation during the Persian invasion, one commentator suggesting it was something of \\"a soldier's war\\" (i.e., it was the soldiers rather than generals that won the war).[213] Thermopylae is often used as a good example of the use of terrain as a force multiplier,[214] while Themistocles's ruse before Salamis is a good example of the use of deception in warfare. The major lesson of the invasion, reaffirming the events at the Battle of Marathon, was the superiority of the hoplite in close-quarters fighting over the more-lightly armed Persian infantry.[164][169] Taking on this lesson, the Persian empire would later, after the Peloponnesian War, start recruiting and relying on Greek mercenaries.[215]","input":"Which emperor started the second persian invasion of greece?"},{"output":"Robert E.

The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in Fantastic Four #52 (cover-dated July 1966) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the heart shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced technology to combat his enemies.\\r\\nBlack Panther is the first superhero of African descent in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early African American superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the Falcon (1969), Luke Cage (1972) and Blade (1973), or DC Comics' John Stewart in the role of Green Lantern (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by Kasper Cole, a multiracial New York City police officer. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda is also given to T'Challa's sister Shuri for a time when he is left recovering from critical injuries.\\r\\nBlack Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. The character is portrayed in live action by Chadwick Boseman in the 2016 film Captain America: Civil War, and the 2018 film Black Panther, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In 2011, Black Panther was ranked 51st overall on IGN's \\"Top 100 Comic Books Heroes\\" list.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the Black Panther Party, though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO), nor the segregated World War II Black Panthers Tank Battalion.[2][3] Stan Lee, co-creator of the comic, denied that the comic was named after any of the political uses of the term \\"black panther\\", including the LCFO, citing \\"a strange coincidence\\".[4] He is the first black superhero in American mainstream comic books; very few black heroes were created before him, and none with actual superpowers. These included the characters in the single-issue, low-distribution All-Negro Comics #1 (1947); Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the omnibus title Jungle Tales, from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics; and the Dell Comics Western character Lobo, the first black person to star in his own comic book. Previous non-caricatured black supporting characters in comics include U.S. Army infantry private Gabriel Jones of Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.\\r\\nIn a guest appearance in Fantastic Four #119 (Feb. 1972), the Black Panther briefly tried using the name Black Leopard to avoid connotations with the Party, but the new name did not last.[5] The character's name was changed back to Black Panther in Avengers #105, with T'Challa explaining that renaming himself made as much sense as altering the Scarlet Witch's name, and he is not a stereotype.[6]\\r\\nCo-creator Stan Lee recounted that the name was inspired by a pulp adventure hero who has a black panther as a helper.[7] Jack Kirby's original concept art for Black Panther used the concept name Coal Tiger.[8]\\r\\nFollowing his debut in Fantastic Four #52ÿ53 (JulyÿAug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in Fantastic Four Annual #5 (1967) and with Captain America in Tales of Suspense #97ÿ100 (Jan.ÿ April 1968), the Black Panther journeyed from the fictional African nation of Wakanda to New York City to join the titular American superhero team in The Avengers #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years. During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of Daredevil, and fought Doctor Doom in Astonishing Tales #6ÿ7 (June & Aug. 1971), in that supervillain's short-lived starring feature.\\r\\nHe received his first starring feature with Jungle Action #5 (July 1973), a reprint of the Panther-centric story in The Avengers #62 (March 1969). A new series began running the following issue, written by Don McGregor, with art by pencilers Rich Buckler, Gil Kane, and Billy Graham, and which gave inkers Klaus Janson and Bob McLeod some of their first professional exposure. The critically acclaimed[9] series ran in Jungle Action #6ÿ24 (Sept. 1973 ÿ Nov. 1976).[10]\\r\\nOne now-common format McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.[11] The first, \\"Panther's Rage\\", ran through the first 13 issues. Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc \\"Marvel's first graphic novel\\":\\r\\n[T]here were real character arcs in Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four [comics] over time. But ... \\"Panther's Rage\\" is the first comic that was created from start to finish as a complete novel. Running in two years' issues of Jungle Action (#s 6 through 18), \\"Panther's Rage\\" is a 200-page novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of Wakanda, a nation ravaged by a revolution against its king, T'Challa, the Black Panther.[11]\\r\\nThe second and final arc, \\"Panther vs. the Klan\\", ran as mostly 17-page stories in Jungle Action #19ÿ24 (Jan.ÿNov. 1976), except for issue #23, a reprint of Daredevil #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Black Panther guest-starred.[10] The subject matter of the Ku Klux Klan was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time, creating difficulties for the creative team.[12]\\r\\nAfrican-American writer-editor Dwayne McDuffie said of the Jungle Action \\"Black Panther\\" feature:\\r\\nThis overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it ... sit down and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene, a functional, necessary part of the whole. Okay, now go back and read any individual issue. You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures; clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don [McGregor] and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue.[9]\\r\\nThough popular with college students, the overall sales of Jungle Action were low,[13] and Marvel relaunched the Black Panther in a self-titled series, bringing in the character's co-creator Jack Kirbynewly returned to Marvel after having decamped to rival DC Comics for a timeas writer, penciler, and editor. However, Kirby wanted to work on new characters and was unhappy at being assigned a series starring a character he had already worked with extensively.[14] He left the series after only 12 issues and was replaced by Ed Hannigan (writer), Jerry Bingham (penciler), and Roger Stern (editor). Black Panther ran 15 issues (Jan. 1977 ÿ May 1979).[15] Due to the series's cancellation, the contents of what would have been Black Panther #16ÿ18 were published in Marvel Premiere #51ÿ53.\\r\\nA four-issue miniseries, Black Panther vol. 2,[16] (JulyÿOct. 1988) was written by Peter B. Gillis and penciled by Denys Cowan.[17] McGregor revisited his Panther saga with Gene Colan in \\"Panther's Quest\\", published as 25 eight-page installments within the bi-weekly anthology series Marvel Comics Presents (issues #13ÿ37, Feb.ÿDec. 1989).[18] He later teamed with artist Dwayne Turner in the square-bound miniseries Black Panther: Panther's Prey (Sept. 1990 ÿ March 1991).[19] McGregor conceived a fifth arc in his Black Panther saga, titled \\"Panther's Vows\\", but it failed to get off the ground.[13]\\r\\nWriter Christopher Priest's and penciller Mark Texeira's 1998 series The Black Panther vol. 3 used Erik Killmonger, Venomm, and other characters introduced in \\"Panther's Rage\\", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross; the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter; and the Panther's protg, Queen Divine Justice. The Priest-Texeira series was under the Marvel Knights imprint in its first year. Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series. \\"I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to,\\" adding that in his opinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation.[20]\\r\\nThe last 13 issues (#50ÿ62) saw the main character replaced by a multiracial New York City police officer named Kasper Cole, with T'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the White Tiger, was placed in the series The Crew, running concurrently with the final few Black Panther issues. The Crew was canceled with issue #7.\\r\\nIn 2005, Marvel began publishing Black Panther vol. 4,[21] which ran 41 issues (April 2005 ÿ Nov. 2008).[22] It was initially written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (through issue #38) and penciled by John Romita, Jr. (through #6). Hudlin said he wanted to add \\"street cred\\" to the title, although he noted that the book was not necessarily or primarily geared toward an African-American readership.[23] As influences for his characterization of the character, Hudlin has cited comic character Batman, film director Spike Lee, and music artist Sean Combs.[23] Other influences include historical figures such as 14th-century Mali Empire sultan Mansa Musa and 20th-century Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey, as well as Biblical figures such as Ham and Canaan.[24]\\r\\nBlack Panther vol. 5[25] launched in February 2009, with Hudlin, again scripting, introducing a successor Black Panther, T'Challa's sister Shuri.[26][27][28] Hudlin co-wrote issue #7 with Jonathan Maberry, who then became the new writer,[29] joined by artist Will Conrad.[30] The Panther was also a featured player, with members of the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, in the Doctor Doom-based, six-issue miniseries Doomwar (AprilÿSept. 2010).[31]\\r\\nT'Challa then accepted an invitation from Matt Murdock, the superhero Daredevil, to become the new protector of New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. He became the lead character in Daredevil beginning with issue #513 (Feb. 2011), when that series was retitled Black Panther: The Man Without Fear.[32] Under writer David Liss and artist Francesco Francavilla, he took on the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and becomes the owner of a small diner in order to be close to the people.[33]\\r\\nA new Black Panther series written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze was launched in 2016 and continues to be published with Coates as the head writer.[34][35][36]\\r\\nIn 2017, the afrofuturist writer Nnedi Okorafor wrote the series Black Panther: Long Live the King.[37]\\r\\nThe Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the advanced African nation of Wakanda. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one must still earn it.\\r\\nIn the distant past, a meteorite made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral vibranium crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler, King T'Chaka, like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife N'Yami died while in labor with T'Challa, and his second wife Ramonda was taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of South Africa, so for most of his childhood T'Challa was raised by his father alone.[38] T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer Ulysses Klaw in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound. With his people still in danger, a young T'Challa used Klaw's sound weapon on Klaw and his men, shattering Klaw's right hand and forcing him to flee.[39]\\r\\nT'Challa was next in line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther, but until he was ready to become the leader of the nation, his uncle S'yan (T'Chaka's younger brother) successfully passed the trials to become the Black Panther. While on his Wakandan walkabout rite of passage, T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen Ororo Munroe, who would grow up to become the X-Men member Storm.[40] The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.\\r\\nT'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zerazethe Wakandan secret policeand its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf.[41] He sold off small portions of vibranium to scientific institutions around the world, amassing a fortune which he used to arm himself with advanced technology.[39] Later, to keep peace, he picked dora milaje (\\"adored ones\\") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad for a time before returning to his kingship.\\r\\nIn his first published appearance, the now-adult T'Challa invites the American superhero team the Fantastic Four to Wakanda, then attacks and attempts to neutralize them individually in order to test himself to see if he is ready to battle Klaw, who had replaced his shattered right hand with a sonic weapon.[42][43] For their part, the Four manage to rally and stymie T'Challa in a team counter-attack, enabling the impressed King to stand down and explain himself to the team's satisfaction. After the ruler makes proper amends to the Four, they befriend and help T'Challa, and he in turn aids them against the supervillain the Psycho-Man.[44] T'Challa later joins the Avengers,[45] beginning a long association with that superhero team. He first battles the Man-Ape while with the group,[46] and then meets the American singer Monica Lynne,[47] with whom he becomes romantically involved. He helps the Avengers defeat the second Sons of the Serpent, and then reveals his true identity on American television.[48] He encounters Daredevil, and reveals to him that he had deduced Daredevil's true identity.[49]\\r\\nAfter receiving numerous urgent official letters requesting him to return to his increasingly troubled homeland,[50] the Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war, bringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper Erik Killmonger and his minions,[51] the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the Ku Klux Klan.[52] He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting artifacts known as King Solomon's Frogs.[53] These produce an alternate version of T'Challa from a future 10 years hence, a merry, telepathic Panther with a terminal brain aneurysm, whom T'Challa places in cryogenic stasis.\\r\\nLater, while searching for and finding his stepmother Ramonda, the Panther contends with South African authorities during Apartheid.[54] T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,[55] though the couple never marry.\\r\\nYears later, the Panther accepts a Washington, D.C. envoy, Everett K. Ross, and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats. In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first threat he and Ross encounter is \\"Xcon\\", an alliance of rogue intelligence agents backing a coup led by the Reverend Achebe.[56] Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy. This forces T'Challa to nationalize foreign companies.[57] Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting the role of Black Panther,[58] but falls into a coma upon eating the heart-shaped herbpoisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline, which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects.[59] T'Challa preserves his rival's life rather than allowing him to die.\\r\\nLater, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council[60] and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.\\r\\nT'Challa recounts the story of his ascension as the Black Panther in the fourth volume of his eponymous comic book series. He defeated his uncle during the Black Panther celebration,[61] and during his walkabout when he met and fell in love with a street urchin named Ororo in Cairo, Egypt.[62] Unbeknownst to him the US government is planning a coup in order to get access to the vibranium. They allow Klaw to recruit a team of villains in order to support his totalitarian neighbor, Niganda. Klaw recruits Rhino, Black Knight, Batroc the Leaper, and Radioactive Man to lead the invasion. The US government then deploys an army of Deathloks to \\"support\\" T'Challa and justify an invasion, but T'Challa kills Klaw and Storm wipes out the Deathlok army in a hurricane.[63]\\r\\nT'Challa then helps his old flame Ororo Munroe reunite with her surviving family members in Africa and the U.S.[64] He shortly afterward proposes,[volume?&?issue?needed] and the two are married in a large Wakandan ceremony attended by many superheroes.[65] One of the couple's first tasks is to embark on a diplomatic tour, in which they visit the Inhumans, Doctor Doom, the President of the United States, and Namor, with only the last one ending well.[66] After the death of Bill Foster, the Black Panther and Storm side with Captain America's anti-registration forces.[67] During the end battle between both sides, the Wakandan embassy in Manhattan is heavily damaged, though no Wakandans are hurt.[68] After the confrontation, the Panther and Storm briefly fill in for vacationing Fantastic Four members Reed and Sue Richards before returning to Wakanda.[69]\\r\\nUpon returning to Wakanda alone, leaving Storm in New York to aid the X-Men, Black Panther faces Erik Killmonger, defeating him with assistance from Monica Rambeau (a.k.a. Pulsar).[70] Afterward, Wakanda fends off the alien shapeshifters the Skrulls, who had infiltrated as part of their \\"Secret Invasion\\" plan to conquer Earth.[71] Prince Namor attempts to recruit T'Challa for the Cabal, a secret council of supervillains. Attacked by the forces of fellow Cabal member Doctor Doom, T'Challa is left comatose.[72] His sister Shuri is trained as the next Panther, with the mantle passing onto her officially after T'Challa awakens from his coma and attempts to recover from his injuries.[73]\\r\\nIn the aftermath, T'Challa loses all of his enhanced attributes given to him by being the panther totem. As a result, he works with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to accumulate a replacement.[74] He has since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body, making himself highly resistant to most magic and mystic assaults. This has all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom,[75] which culminated in T'Challa rendering all of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element.[76]\\r\\nAfter the events of \\"Shadowland\\", Matt Murdock (the superhero Daredevil) asks T'Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell's Kitchen, which gives T'Challa a chance to discover himself. With the help of Foggy Nelson, T'Challa assumes the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Congo and manager of a diner called Devil's Kitchen, so that he can blend in and learn about the denizens as an ordinary man. He gets on well with two of the Kitchen's staff: Sofija, a migrant from Serbia who was formerly involved in violent Serbian nationalism, and the busboy, Brian. He also gets to know some of the neighbors from his apartment block: Mr. Nantakarn and his son Alec, as well as Iris, a social worker assigned to handle cases of child abuse.[77]\\r\\nT'Challa finds himself up against an ambitious new crime lord, Vlad Dinu, who styles himself \\"The Impaler\\". He also seeks an understanding with the police through Detective Alex Kurtz. During an attempt by Vlad to terminate the Panther, Brian from the Devil's Kitchen is seriously injured by an energy blast from Vlad, and is reported dead. The conflict between Vlad and the Panther becomes more personal, especially after Vlad discovers the Panther over his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound.[77]\\r\\nT'Challa learns that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of childrenGabe was abused secretly by Angela. Brian was kidnapped by his doctor, Dr. Holman, at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who received a dose of Vlad's power. After being subjected to torturous experiments, Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by Gabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the recipient with Vlad's powers. The Panther obtains evidence of Vlad Dinu's crimes as well as clues to Iris as the serial shooter, and turns the evidence over to Kurtz. Vlad kills his own son Nicolae before being subdued by the Panther. Gabe is arrested for attempting to take Iris' life. Before being taken away, Gabe reveals to the Panther Brian's fate. Though aware of the Panther's identity as Mr. Okonkwo, both Iris and Sofija promise to keep silent.[77]\\r\\nShortly after Daredevil returns to Hell's Kitchen, T'Challa returns to Wakanda, serving as a second to his sister, Shuri. In preparation for an upcoming attack on Wakanda as part of the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline, the Panther God returns T'Challa's abilities.[78] Empowered by the Phoenix, Namor destroys Wakanda with a massive tidal wave.[79] Returning to help, Storm is stunned when the Panther informs her that their marriage has been annulled.[80]\\r\\nAfter witnessing an alternate Earth over Wakanda being destroyed by the Black Swan, T'Challa reforms the Illuminatiwith Beast replacing the now-deceased Charles Xavierto confront the threat of the Incursions, parallel universes colliding with each other to the destruction of both. Although able to avert one Incursion with the Infinity Gauntlet, the subsequent destruction of the Infinity Gems forces the group to decide to resort to more questionable measures to protect Earth from future Incursions, wiping Captain America's mind so that he will not remember these events, allowing them to do \\"what needs to be done\\".[81] Although equipped with planet-destroying weapons to protect Earth, the Illuminati mostly become disgusted with the wholesale slaughter, until Namor breaks off from the group to form a new Cabal of villains to do what the heroes will not. Despite Namor's Cabal achieving legitimacy as Earth's protectors, Namor grew weary of the wholesale slaughter they carried out in the name of preserving their universe. Although he collaborated with the Illuminati in a plan to destroy the Cabal by trapping them on the next Earth to be destroyed, Black Panther and Black Bolt left him behind to die with the Cabal, disgusted at his earlier actions,[82] although Namor and the Cabal escape to the Ultimate universe when the other Earth has a simultaneous Incursion.[83]\\r\\nWhen the final Incursion occurs during the Secret Wars storyline, resulting in all realities collapsing into one Earth, Black Panther is one of the few heroes to survive the Incursion in a specially-designed \\"life pod\\"other survivors including Mister Fantastic, Star-Lord, Spider-Man, the new Thor, Captain Marvel and a Phoenix-enhanced Cyclopsalthough they are only released into the new world after an eight-year stasis. Retrieved by Doctor Strange, they learn that Strange has assumed a role of \\"sheriff\\" to Doctor Doom, who has appointed himself the god of the new \\"Battleworld\\" created from the multiple realities.[84] Although Doom effortlessly kills Cyclops, Strange protects the other heroes by dispersing them across Battleworld,[85] with T'Challa and Namor eventually discovering a new version of the Infinity Gauntlet that Strange collected, ensuring that the Gems he found would work in the location where Doom built his main fortress.[86] Recruiting the residents of the deadlands as an army, T'Challa marches on Doom at the same time as multiple other areas rebel against him through the encouragement of the heroes,[87] but admits when Doom confronts him that he was only intended as a distraction while Reed targets Doom's power source. As Reed takes Doom's power and sets out to rebuild the multiverse, T'Challa uses the Time Gem to take himself back to Wakanda before the Incursions, proclaiming to his people that they will lead the way to the stars and explore new ideas.[88]\\r\\nAs part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Black Panther is a member of the Ultimates.[89]\\r\\nDuring the Civil War II storyline, Black Panther represents Wakanda on the Alpha Flight Space Program's Board of Governors.[90] He sides with Captain Marvel on needing help from an Inhuman who can predict the possible future named Ulysses Kain.[volume?&?issue?needed] Black Panther and Shuri take part in the fight against the Leviathon Tide.[91]\\r\\nDuring Hydra's reign over the world led by Arnim Zola, Baron Zemo and Steve Rogers, Panther is captured for opposing this regime, and brought into a containing room. Once Panther and Zemo are alone, Winter Soldier rescues Panther. Panther entrusts the unconscious Zemo to Winter Soldier, while trailing Rogers and Zola into the secret lab. Panther finds out that Zola infused a brainwashed Captain America with a Cosmic Cube using a stolen Stark tech modified by Zola himself, and warns his allies to retreat from a Cosmic Cube-powered Steve Rogers, but is too late.[92] Even though one of the heroes knows they cannot defeat a Cosmic Cube-powered Supreme Hydra Rogers, Winter Soldier, Captain America (Sam Wilson) and Ant-Man (Scott Lang) trick Rogers by surrendering the last fragment of the cube to him. Winter Soldier and Ant-Man steal the cube from Rogers before he uses its full potential, and bring back Kobik and the real Steve Rogers.[93][94] After the defeat of Supreme Hydra Steve Rogers, Black Panther establishes his quest to go across the universe with his people, and found an Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda on Planet Bast, located in the Benhazin Star System.[95]\\r\\nThe title \\"Black Panther\\" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to eat a special heart-shaped herb which, in addition to his mystical, shamanistic connection with the Wakandan Panther God Bast, grants him superhumanly acute senses, enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability, healing, and reflexes.[96][97]\\r\\nHe has since lost this connection and forged a new one with another unknown Panther deity, granting him augmented physical attributes as well as a resistance to magic.[75] His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones. Following his war with Doom, T'Challa loses his enhanced abilities only to once again establish a connection with the Panther God.[78] In addition to the resurgence of his now superhuman abilities, he is anointed \\"King of the Dead\\", granting him the power and knowledge of all the past Black Panthers as well as the ability to control the Undead.[98] After Battleworld and the resurgence of the Multiverse T'challa eventually showcased new powers in regards to his King of the Dead status, for not only could he reanimate the dead but summon departed spirits into the physical world with tangible form as well. Using these spiritual energies also enables him to conjure a mythical mystical spear of glowing blue energy to his hand.[99]\\r\\nT'Challa worked with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to endow T'Challa with immunity to mystical attacks and detection in order to defeat Dr. Doom. When T'Challa's alchemical upgrade was tested by means of Wakanda's most powerful acolytes attacking T'Challa in unison, each mystical attack was absorbed and only served to strengthen T'Challa. During these preparations, T'Challa invented a potent mystical-scientific hybrid art called \\"shadow physics\\" and was able to use it to craft shadow weapons and to track vibranium on a quantum level.[75]\\r\\nAs king of Wakanda, the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, and the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth. His attire is the sacred vibranium costume of the Wakandan Panther Cult.\\r\\nHe is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, politician, inventor, and scientist. He has a PhD in physics from Oxford University. He is proficient in physics and advanced technology, and is also an inventor. T'Challa has been granted the strength and knowledge of every past Black Panther.[78]\\r\\nT'Challa is rigorously trained in acrobatics and hand-to-hand combat. He is skilled in various forms of unarmed combat, with a unique hybrid fighting style that incorporates acrobatics and aspects of animal mimicry.[100]\\r\\nThe chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan is one of the wealthiest people in the world, although financial estimates are difficult given Wakanda's isolation from the world's economy and the uncertain value of Wakanda's vast vibranium reserves and extremely advanced technologies.[101]\\r\\nIn Black Panther volume 3, writer Christopher Priest expanded the Panther's day-to-day arsenal to include equipment such as an \\"energy dagger\\", a vibranium-weave suit, and a portable supercomputer, the \\"Kimoyo card\\".[102] In Black Panther volume 4, writer Reginald Hudlin introduced such specialized equipment as \\"thrice-blessed armor\\" and \\"light armor\\" for specific tasks,[103] and for a short while outfitted him with the Ebony Blade of the Black Knight.[104]\\r\\nThe mantle of the Black Panther is passed down from generation to generation among the rulers of Wakanda[105] although it must still be deserved through a severe selection involving the best warriors of the nation.\\r\\nBashenga appeared for the first time in Black Panther Vol. 1 #7 (January 1978) by Jack Kirby (scripts and drawings). Wise warrior at the head of the Panther Tribe, according to legends, during the tumult where the vibranium meteorite fell on the soil of the village, then composed of various warring clans, he gathered all the aforementioned under his guide to defeating the inhabitants transformed by the impact into fierce \\"demonic spirits\\", a company which has unified the nation by founding Wakanda and becoming its first ruler[106] and the first to obtain the title of \\"Black Panther\\" as it tells of his \\"spiritual connection\\" with the Goddess Pantera Bast that led to the foundation of the Cult of the Panther.[105]\\r\\nChanda appeared for the first time in Fantastic Four Unlimited Vol. 1 #1 (March 1993) by Roy Thomas (scripts) and Herb Trimpe (drawings). Black Panther and ruler of Wakanda during the Second World War, Chanda is the husband of Nanali and father of T'Chaka and S'Yan; distinguished by an excessively good and compassionate nature, he welcomed the Nazi colonel Fritz Klaue after he crashed into his reign due to a plane crash. Over time, the two make a kind of friendship and Klaue develops a strong obsession with the culture of Wakanda coming to try to convince them to make their religion deist rather than spiritist, which causes a strong friction between him and Chanda culminating in the death of Nanali by the Nazi and in its subsequent expulsion from the country.[107]\\r\\nIn several subsequent stories, T'Chaka's father (and husband of Nanali) is called Azzuri the Wise and is presented in a completely different way from Chanda,[108][109] leaving the doubt if it is only a sort of nickname or another character.\\r\\nT'Chaka appeared for the first time in Fantastic Four Vol. 1 #53 (August 1966) by Stan Lee (scripts) and Jack Kirby (drawings). The eldest son of King Azzuri and Queen Nanali, T'Chaka inherits the throne and the title of the Black Panther on his father's death by being helped in his monarch duties by his younger brother and trusted adviser S'Yan.[110] After having married a woman named N'Yami, believing she can not have children, she adopts a child with her, Hunter, however, she later becomes pregnant and dies giving birth to her first child, T'Challa; from the relationship with a woman of another tribe T'Chaka then has a second son, Jakarra, and finally remarries with Ramonda, a woman who grows her children as her own and from whom she has her only daughter, Shuri,[110] but which subsequently disappears into nothingness, leading him to believe that he has abandoned it.[38] To protect the kingdom, T'Chaka instituted a policy of strong isolationism,[111] but in the course of his life he often collaborated with agents of the US government.[109][112] He is killed by Ulysses Klaw after having surprised him to illegally extract vibranium in his kingdom.[113]\\r\\nS'Yan The Fast, appeared for the first time in Black Panther Vol. 4 #2 (May, 2005) by Reginald Hudlin (scripts) and John Romita Jr. (drawings). The second son of King Azzuri and Queen Nanali, S'Yan is T'Chaka's younger and trusted advisor, after whose death, although he has no desire to reign, he agrees to ascend the throne until his nephew became an adult.[110] Ironically, S'Yan, who has never wanted to be king, becomes one of the most beloved monarchs in the history of Wakanda but, nevertheless, when T'Challa returns home and obtains the title of Black Panther, he becomes a he leaves with joy, returning to play the role of real advisor.[110] He died during the war with Latveria to defend Ramonda from the soldiers of Doctor Doom.\\r\\nWhen T'Challa ends up in a coma because of Doctor Doom,[114] Shuri becomes his substitute as Black Panther and queen of Wakanda which, after the rise of his half-brother to \\"king of the dead\\", creates for the first time in history two avatars of the Panther Goddess.\\r\\nBlack Panther was ranked the 79th greatest comic book character by Wizard magazine.[115] IGN ranked the character the 51st greatest comic book hero, stating that the Black Panther could be called Marvel's Batman,[116] and tenth in their list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\".[117] In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked the Black Panther as #33 on their list of the \\"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\\".[118]\\r\\nJournalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther, stating, that the writer \\"turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion. T'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it\\". Gross applauded the title's \\"endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels\\".[119]\\r\\nComics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. \\"Christopher Priest's fractured writing is getting on my nerves. Like the Spider-Man comics, I want to like Black Panther, but Priest's deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly. I know it's a style, but does he have to do it every issue?\\"[120]\\r\\nReporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched. \\"I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: 'This is like watching \\"Pulp Fiction\\" in rewind. My head is exploding.'\\"[121]\\r\\nPublishers Weekly gave a negative review to the first arc, \\"Who Is the Black Panther?\\", a modern retelling of the character's origin, saying, \\"Hudlin's take is caught between a rock and a hard place. His over-the-top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character, but it's too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader. The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing\\".[122]\\r\\nJournalist Shawn Jeffords, citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue, called the new series a \\"fairly unimpressive launch\\". Jeffords also said general-audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance. \\"He's never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough\\".[123]\\r\\nT'Challa is Coal Tiger, Sersi kills the Avengers and Coal Tiger is the only survivor.[124]\\r\\nIn the Age of Ultron story, Black Panther contacts the Fantastic Four and informs them that Ultron has invaded Earth with an army of Ultron Sentinels.[125] Black Panther was later seen with Red Hulk and Taskmaster in Chicago spying on some Ultron Sentinels. When Taskmaster takes out a Sentinel that was sneaking up on him, alerting the other Sentinels, Red Hulk holds off the Sentinels while Black Panther and Taskmaster flee. During the mayhem, Black Panther falls several stories and breaks his neck, killing him instantly.[126]\\r\\nBronze Tiger is the ruler of Wakanda and is named B'Nchalla; an amalgamation of the Bronze Tiger (DC) and the Black Panther (Marvel).\\r\\nIn Avengers Forever, Captain America and Goliath visit an alternate future timeline where Martian invaders have ravaged the Earth. An aged Black Panther leads this reality's version of the Avengers, who consist of Jocasta, Living Lightning, Killraven, Crimson Dynamo and Thundra.[127]\\r\\nIn an alternate reality where the Civil War between Iron Man and Captain America never ended, Black Panther was killed alongside Maria Hill after activating Prison 42's self-destruct mechanism.[128] He is succeeded by his son, Azari, who takes on the Black Panther name.[129] It is later revealed that the Black Panther who destroyed Prison 42 was actually Queen Veranke of the shape-shifting alien Skrull race, who had stolen T'Challa's identity in order to manipulate and prolong the Civil War to suit her own needs.[130]\\r\\nT'Challa is Chieftain Justice, a Captain Britain Corps member, in Excalibur #44 (1991).[131]\\r\\nIn the alternate universe of Earth X, T'Challa has been affected by the mutative event that drives the plot. Like most of humanity, he is mutated; in this case to become a humanoid black panther. He is entrusted with the Cosmic Cube by Captain America, who knows that T'Challa would be the only one to resist using it and to never give it back if asked. In fact, Captain America does ask for it back and T'Challa is forced to refuse.[132]\\r\\nAn alternate version of Black Panther, called simply \\"Panther\\", is drafted onto the interdimensional superhero team the Exiles.[133] The Panther is the son of T'Challa and Storm and named T'Chaka, after his grandfather. Originating from Earth-1119, he was ambushed by Klaw while examining some ruins. Caught in Klaw's blast, the Panther was plucked out of time and placed on the team.[133] Unlike the stoic 616-Black Panther, The Panther is a wisecracking flirt.[133] After his assumed death on Earth-1119, his sister took up the mantle of Black Panther.[134]\\r\\nThe Black Panther appears in issues #1 and #6ÿ7 of Marvel Comics/Fox Kids comic book series based on the TV show The Avengers: United They Stand.\\r\\nT'Challa appears in Marvel Mangaverse Volume 2 as a man with a pet panther. When summoning the spirits, T'Challa and his panther combine to become the Black Panther. He also became The Falcon. This Black Panther was romantically attracted to Tigra. T'Challa's sister, T'Chana, reveals herself to be this universe's Doctor Doom.[135]\\r\\nIn the Marvel 2099 continuity, a greatly weakened Wakanda is soon to be governed by its princess, Okusana. Fearing that she is not ready, she requests Doom's help in resurrecting Thandaza, her grandfather and a former Black Panther. Doom (who claims to have agreed to the proposal out of respect for T'Challa) and the Wakandan scientists revive Thandaza in a cyberbetic body made from vibranium, but the plan goes awry when Mkhalali, the current Panther Guard, opens fire on Thandaza, believing his resurrection to be an abomination. The attack throws off the calibrations and leaves Thandaza in a maddened state and constant pain, causing him to go on a bloody rampage. Doom is ultimately forced to kill Thandaza, who thanks him for ending his suffering.[136]\\r\\nBlack Panther was featured in the Marvel Knights 2099 one shots, which were not tied to the main 2099 continuity. A new Black Panther, K'Shamba, rose to fight and thwart the mounting invasions by the successor of Doom. While the victory over the new Doom appeared triumphant, the new Wakandan king was ultimately revealed to be a puppet of Doom.[137]\\r\\nBlack Panther is, for the most part, one of the few uninfected superheroes in the alternate-universe series Marvel Zombies, where he is kept as a food supply for the Zombie Giant-Man, who keeps the Panther imprisoned and cuts off various limbs so that he can maintain his intelligence via a ready access to fresh meat without infecting Panther with the zombie \\"virus\\".[138] Despite having lost half of his right arm and his left foot, the Panther escapeswith the severed head of zombified superheroine the Wasp in tow[139]and joins forces with the mutant group the Acolytes.[140] While with the Acolytes, T'Challa briefly talks with his Earth-616 counterpart, where he expresses surprise at his marriage to Storm but offers him all the information he can provide about the zombie plague.[141] Decades later, T'Challa has married one of the Acolytes, Lisa Hendricks, and they have a son, with Forge having provided T'Challa with artificial limbs to compensate for his injuries.[142] Facing retirement, the Panther is stabbed and critically wounded by an agent of an Acolyte splinter group, and the Wasp now a willing ally after having lost her zombie hunger zombifies the Panther in order to grant him continued existence. With the Wasp's help, he survives to the post-hunger stage himself and continues to lead his people, despite his status.[143] Further internal betrayal lead the Black Panther and many of his allies to be tossed through the dimensions.[144] He ends up involved with another Earth that is threatened by the zombie virus. His attempts to save this new planet fail and he is destroyed, leaving only one hand displayed as a trophy by his enemies.[145]\\r\\nIn the MC2 universe, Black Panther has a son named T'Chaka II, who joined the A-Next as the Coal Tiger.[146]\\r\\nIn the Mutant X reality, Black Panther had the appearance of a humanoid black panther. He is among the second wave of heroes who died fighting the Beyonder.[147]\\r\\nIn the alternate-reality Ultimate Marvel imprint, the Black Panther is T'Challa Udaku, a young man who is experimented on in the Weapon X program before being liberated by Nick Fury.[148]\\r\\nT'Challa, the younger son of King T'Chaka of Wakanda, is severely injured during the \\"Trial of the Panther\\" from which the protector of the nation is selected. His older brother M'Baku finds T'Challa bloodied, mute, and near death but derisively calls him a fool for attempting the trial. Later, M'Baku adds that he, not T'Challa, should have taken the trial. Angry that his father has decided to share Wakanda's technology in exchange for America's help in saving T'Challa's life, M'Baku leaves the kingdom.\\r\\nTo save T'Challa, T'Chaka turns him over to the Weapon X program. Over a year later, a healthy T'Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, has enhanced speed, strength, night vision, and healing ability. Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like Adamantium claws from his knuckles by balling his hands into fists. T'Chaka becomes outraged upon learning that S.H.I.E.L.D. (who had shut down Weapon X and freed T'Challa) now considers his son an asset of the U.S. and S.H.I.E.L.D. He subsequently sends M'Baku a letter, claiming that M'Baku, not T'Challa, is the titular \\"favorite son\\", and he implores M'Baku to return.\\r\\nFury has Captain America train and mentor the Panther, who reveals his damaged throat. Captain America, sympathizing for the Panther's plight, encourages Fury to place the Panther in the superhero team the Ultimates. This turns out to be a ruse in which Captain America impersonates the Panther, allowing T'Challa to escape and return home to Wakanda.[149]\\r\\nCaptain America later impersonates Black Panther during an Ultimates confrontation with the Juggernaut.[150]\\r\\nAfter Ultimatum, Black Panther joins the New Ultimates.[151]\\r\\nChadwick Boseman portrays T'Challa within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, first appearing in Captain America: Civil War (2016).[165][166] In the film, he is shown displaying enhanced speed, agility, strength, and durability, which he gains from ingesting the Heart Shaped Herb, as in the comics.[167] His suit has retractable claws and is made of a vibranium weave, which can deflect heavy machine gun fire. As of the 2018 film Black Panther, he wears a new variant of the suit that can absorb kinetic energy (represented as purple highlights) and release it as a purple shockwave after enough has been amassed. It can also fold into a silver necklace.\\r\\nIn 2016, Disney XD launched on its YouTube channel the motion comic \\"Black Panther in ...

The use of the term is sometimes criticized,[1][2][3] because it can be mistakenly interpreted to mean that the ASCII standard has been updated to include more than 128 characters or that the term unambiguously identifies a single encoding, both of which are not the case.\\r\\nThere are many extended ASCII encodings (more than 220 DOS and Windows codepages). EBCDIC (\\"the other\\" major 8-bit character code) likewise developed many extended variants (more than 186 EBCDIC codepages) over the decades.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nASCII was designed in the 1960s for teleprinters and telegraphy, and some computing. Early teleprinters were electromechanical, having no microprocessor and just enough electromechanical memory to function. They fully processed one character at a time, returning to an idle state immediately afterward. They were typewriter-derived impact printers, and could only print a fixed set of glyphs, which were cast into a metal type element or elements. Seven-bit ASCII improved over prior five- and six-bit codes: it added the lowercase letters of the English alphabet and more symbols, for a total of 95 printing characters; it encoded the letters in alphabetical order rather than keyboard position; and it used the extra bits to address all characters rather than use control characters to select banks of characters.\\r\\nASCII encodes only 95 carefully selected printable characters (94 glyphs and one space), which include the English alphabet (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and 31 punctuation marks and symbols: all of the symbols on a standard US typewriter plus a few; enough to communicate English-language text information. The number of printable characters was deliberately kept small, to keep teleprinters and line printers inexpensive. Some popular peripherals only implemented a 64-printing-character subset: Teletype Model 33 could not transmit \\"a\\" through \\"z\\" or five less-common symbols (\` { | } and ~). and when they received such characters they instead printed \\"A\\" through \\"Z\\" (forced all caps) and five other mostly-similar symbols (@ [ \\\\ ] and ^).\\r\\nThe ASCII character set is barely large enough for general use, and far too small for universal use. Many more letters and symbols are desirable, useful, or required to directly represent letters of alphabets other than English, more kinds of punctuation and spacing, more mathematical operators and symbols (G  { R    etc.), some unique symbols used by some programming languages, ideograms, logograms, box-drawing characters, etc.\\r\\nThe biggest problem for computer users around the world was other alphabets. ASCII's English alphabet almost accommodates European languages, if accented letters are replaced by non-accented letters or two-character approximations. Languages with dissimilar basic alphabets could use transliteration. Users were not comfortable with such compromises.\\r\\nModified variants of 7-bit ASCII appeared promptly, trading some lesser-used symbols for highly-desired symbols or letters, such as replacing \\"#\\" with \\"S\\" on UK Teletypes, \\"\\\\\\" with \\"\\" in Japan or \\"?\\" in Korea, etc. At least 29 variant sets resulted. 12 code points were modified by at least one modified set, leaving only 82 \\"invariant\\" codes.\\r\\nThere was always temptation to make a larger character set (preferably by extending a standard character set), but there was no easy path forward. There was no way to define a universal extension. There was no hardware to print or display an extended set. For years, applications were designed around the 64-character set and/or the 95-character set, so several characters acquired new uses. (For example, ASCII lacks \\"\\", so most programming languages use \\"/\\" (and sometimes \\"\\\\\\") to indicate division, and most still do not recognize \\"\\". C interprets the two-character sequences \\"<%\\" and \\"%>\\" as equivalent to \\"{\\" and \\"}\\" because \\"{\\" and \\"}\\" are not available on all keyboards.)\\r\\nThe English alphabet was generally useful on computers around the world, for programming, operation, and international communication, so extended character sets that added to the original ASCII set were a good idea.\\r\\nSeven-bit ASCII encodes only 128 characters (including control characters). When computers and peripherals standardized on eight-bit bytes, it became obvious that computers and software could handle text that uses 256-character sets at almost no additional cost in programming, and no additional cost for storage. (Assuming that the unused 8th bit of each byte was not reused in some way, such as error checking, Boolean fields, or packing 8 characters into 7 bytes.) An eight-bit character set (using one byte per character) encodes 256 characters, so it can include ASCII plus 128 more characters. (Variable multi-byte schemes based on ASCII can add many more additional characters. Unmodified code will provide valid results searching for sequences of ASCII and extended characters. But software must be more sophisticated, only accepting or creating valid multi-byte characters, and always treating multi-byte characters as one character whenever counting, copying, comparing, inserting, or deleting characters.)\\r\\nMany manufacturers devised 8-bit character sets consisting of ASCII plus up to 128 of the unused codes, with varying degrees of cooperation or coordination by national and international standards bodies.\\r\\n128 additional characters is not enough to cover all purposes, all languages, or even all European languages, so the emergence of many proprietary and national ASCII-derived 8-bit character sets was inevitable.\\r\\nDrawbacks of multiple 8-bit character sets are that conversion of text data from one character encoding to another (transcoding) is complex, and almost always has the possibility of changing non-ASCII characters in the text. Conversion requires a custom map from one character set to the other, or a description of both character sets from which the map can be generated. If any characters in the text are not defined in the destination character set, those characters cannot be converted. Even one unconvertible character can mean failure of conversion, or the converter can substitute a similar character (or characters) or a warning character (typically \\"?\\"), and may issue a warning when done. When characters are substituted, a human should inspect and possibly modify the output text, possibly examining the input text.\\r\\nVarious proprietary modifications and extensions of ASCII appeared on non-EBCDIC mainframe computers and minicomputers, especially in universities.\\r\\nHewlett-Packard started to add European characters to their extended 7-bit / 8-bit ASCII character set HP Roman Extension around 1978/1979 for use with their workstations, terminals and printers. This later evolved into the widely used regular 8-bit character sets HP Roman-8 and HP Roman-9 (as well as a number of variants).\\r\\nAtari and Commodore home computers added many graphic symbols to their non-standard ASCII (Respectively, ATASCII and PETSCII, based on the original ASCII standard of 1963).\\r\\nThe TRS-80 home computer additions included 64 semigraphics characters (0x80 through 0xAF) that implemented low-resolution block graphics. (Each block-graphic character displayed as a 2x3 grid of pixels, with each block pixel effectively controlled by one of the lower 6 bits.)\\r\\nIBM introduced eight-bit extended ASCII codes on the original IBM PC and later produced variations for different languages and cultures. IBM called such character sets code pages and assigned numbers to both those they themselves invented as well as many invented and used by other manufacturers. Accordingly, character sets are very often indicated by their IBM code page number. In ASCII-compatible code pages, the lower 128 characters maintained their standard US-ASCII values, and different pages (or sets of characters) could be made available in the upper 128 characters. DOS computers built for the North American market, for example, used code page 437, which included accented characters needed for French, German, and a few other European languages, as well as some graphical line-drawing characters. The larger character set made it possible to create documents in a combination of languages such as English and French (though French computers usually use code page 850), but not, for example, in English and Greek (which required code page 737).\\r\\nApple Computer introduced their own eight-bit extended ASCII codes in Mac OS, such as Mac OS Roman.\\r\\nDigital Equipment Corporation (DEC) developed the Multinational Character Set, which had fewer characters but more letter and diacritic combinations. It was supported by the VT220 and later DEC computer terminals. This later became the basis for other character sets such as the Lotus International Character Set (LICS), ECMA-94 and ISO 8859-1.\\r\\nEventually, ISO released this standard as ISO 8859 describing its own set of eight-bit ASCII extensions. The most popular is ISO 8859-1, also called ISO Latin?1, which contained characters sufficient for the most common Western European languages. Variations were standardized for other languages as well: ISO 8859-2 for Eastern European languages and ISO 8859-5 for Cyrillic languages, for example.\\r\\nOne notable way in which ISO character sets differ from code pages is that the character positions 128 to 159, corresponding to ASCII control characters with the high-order bit set, are specifically unused and undefined in the ISO standards, though they had often been used for printable characters in proprietary code pages, a breaking of ISO standards that was almost universal.\\r\\nMicrosoft later created code page 1252, a compatible superset of ISO 8859-1 with extra characters in the ISO unused range. Code page 1252 is the standard character encoding of western European language versions of Microsoft Windows, including English versions. ISO 8859-1 is the common 8-bit character encoding used by the X Window System, and most Internet standards used it before Unicode.\\r\\nThe meaning of each extended code point can be different in every encoding. In order to correctly interpret and display text data (sequences of characters) that includes extended codes, hardware and software that reads or receives the text must use the specific extended ASCII encoding that applies to it. Applying the wrong encoding causes irrational substitution of many or all extended characters in the text.\\r\\nSoftware can use a fixed encoding selection, or it can select from a palette of encodings by defaulting, checking the computer's nation and language settings, reading a declaration in the text, analyzing the text, asking the user, letting the user select or override, and/or defaulting to last selection. When text is transferred between computers that use different operating systems, software, and encodings, applying the wrong encoding can be commonplace.\\r\\nBecause the full English alphabet and the most-used characters in English are included in the seven-bit code points of ASCII, which are common to all encodings (even most proprietary encodings), English-language text is less damaged by interpreting it with the wrong encoding, but text in other languages can display as mojibake (complete nonsense). Because many Internet standards use ISO 8859-1, and because Microsoft Windows (using the code page 1252 superset of ISO 8859-1) is the dominant operating system for personal computers today, unannounced use of ISO 8859-1 is quite commonplace, and may generally be assumed unless there are indications otherwise.\\r\\nMany communications protocols, most importantly SMTP and HTTP, require the character encoding of content to be tagged with IANA-assigned character set identifiers.\\r\\nSome multi-byte character encodings (character encodings that can handle more than 256 different characters) are also true extended ASCII. That means all ASCII characters are encoded with a single byte with the value that is used in ASCII to encode that character. They can be used in file formats where only ASCII bytes are used for keywords and file format syntax, while bytes 0x80-0xFF might be used for free text, including most programming languages, where language keywords, variable names, and function names must be in ASCII, but string constants and comments can use non-ASCII characters. This makes it much easier to introduce a multi-byte character set into existing systems that use extended ASCII.\\r\\nUTF-8 is true extended ASCII, as are some Extended Unix Code encodings.\\r\\nISO/IEC 6937 is not extended ASCII because its code point 0x24 corresponds to the general currency sign (N) rather than to the dollar sign ($), but it is an extended version of the International Reference Version of ISO 646.\\r\\nShift JIS is not true extended ASCII, because although ASCII characters are encoded the same as in ASCII (except for the backslash; its position is used for the yen character), multi-byte characters can also include ASCII bytes (0x00-0x7F). Shift JIS can directly be used in programming languages and languages such as HTML (if accepting that backslash looks like ), because the bytes used for free text delimiters are not used as part of non-ASCII characters. UTF-16 is even less extended ASCII because ASCII characters are stored as two bytes with one byte equal to 0x00. Porting an existing system to support character sets as Shift JIS or UTF-16 is complicated and bug prone.\\r\\nFor programming languages and document languages such as C and HTML, the principle of Extended ASCII is important, since it enables many different encodings and therefore many human languages to be supported with little extra programming effort in the software that interprets the computer-readable language files.\\r\\nThe principle of Extended ASCII means that:","input":"What is the most common extended ascii set?"},{"output":"Violet Brown","context":"This is a list of tables of the oldest people in the world in ordinal ranks.

However, if all available sources for an artist or band say \\"albums\\", such sources are only used if the certified album units of the said artist meet the required percentage amount.

In other words, the available certified units for each artist should get relatively closer to already listed claimed figure in order for higher figures to replace the listed ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe certified units of the newer artists may sometimes be higher than their listed claimed figures. This is because Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and almost all other certifying bodies count streaming towards Gold and Platinum thresholds required for Digital Single Award certification.[3][4][5] For this reason, some singles and even albums get over certified by hundreds of thousands of units. The over certified figures, however, are often in millions of units for RIAA certifications, one such example is Rihanna's single \\"We Found Love\\", which is certified at nine times Platinum by the RIAA, yet during the time of the certification, it had sold 5.4 million downloads.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe certified units for some artists/bands who have multi-disc albums can be higher than their listed claimed figures due to Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) counting each unit within set as one unit toward certification.\\r\\n\\r\\nIssued certifications for songs which have been recorded by multiple artists including featured artists are added to each artist's total amount of certified units, as all the artists would have played a significant part in a song.

If Herodotus's account is accurate, this eclipse is the earliest recorded as being known in advance of its occurrence. Many historians believe that the predicted eclipse was the solar eclipse of May 28, 585 BC.[1] How exactly Thales predicted the eclipse remains uncertain; some historians claim the eclipse was never predicted at all.[2] Others have argued for different dates.[3]\\r\\nAccording to Herodotus, the appearance of the eclipse was interpreted as an omen, and interrupted a battle in a long-standing war between the Medes and the Lydians. The fighting immediately stopped, and they agreed to a truce. Because astronomers can calculate the dates of historical eclipses, Isaac Asimov described this battle as the earliest historical event whose date is known with precision to the day and described the prediction as \\"the birth of science\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHerodotus' The Histories 1.73-74 states that a war started in the period between the Medes and the Lydians. There were two reasons for the war; the two sides' clashing interests in Anatolia, but also there was a motive of revenge. Some Scythian hunters employed by the Medes who once returned empty-handed were insulted by King Cyaxares. In revenge the hunters slaughtered one of his sons and served him to the Medes. The hunters then fled to Sardis, the capital of the Lydians. When Cyaxares asked for the Scythians to be returned to him, Alyattes II refused to hand them over; in response, the Medes invaded.\\r\\nAfterwards, on the refusal of Alyattes to give up his suppliants when Cyaxares sent to demand them of him, war broke out between the Lydians and the Medes, and continued for five years, with various success. In the course of it the Medes gained many victories over the Lydians, and the Lydians also gained many victories over the Medes. Among their other battles there was one night engagement. As, however, the balance had not inclined in favour of either nation, another combat took place in the sixth year, in the course of which, just as the battle was growing warm, day was on a sudden changed into night. This event had been foretold by Thales, the Milesian, who forewarned the Ionians of it, fixing for it the very year in which it actually took place. The Medes and Lydians, when they observed the change, ceased fighting, and were alike anxious to have terms of peace agreed on.[5]\\r\\nAs part of the terms of the peace agreement, Alyattes's daughter Aryenis was married to Cyaxares's son Astyages, and the Halys River (now known as the K?z?l?rmak River) was declared to be the border of the two warring nations.\\r\\nAn alternative theory regarding the date of the battle suggests that Herodotus was carelessly recounting events that he did not personally witness, and that furthermore the solar eclipse story is a misinterpretation of his text.[6] According to this view, what happened could have been a lunar eclipse right before moonrise, at dusk. If the warriors had planned their battle activities expecting a full moon as in the previous few days, it would have been quite a shock to have dusk fall suddenly as an occluded moon rose. If this theory is correct, the battle's date would be not 585 BC (date given by Pliny based on date of solar eclipse), but possibly 3 Sept 609 BC or 4 July 587 BC, dates when such dusk-time lunar eclipses did occur.[6]\\r\\nWhile doubt has been cast on the truth of the story, there are other accounts of it besides that of Herodotus. Diogenes Laertius says that Xenophanes, who lived in the same century as Thales, was impressed with the prediction, and he also gives additional testimonies from the pre-Socratics Democritus and Heraclitus.[7]\\r\\nAt the time of Thales' purported prediction it was not yet known that eclipses were caused by the Moon coming between the Earth and the Sun, a fact that would not be discovered until over a century later by either Anaxagoras or Empedocles.[8]\\r\\nIf the account is true, it has been suggested that Thales would have had to calculate the timing of any eclipse by recognizing patterns in the periodicities of eclipses.[7] It has been postulated that Thales may have used the Saros cycle in his determination, or that he may have had some knowledge of Babylonian astronomy, but as there is no known cycle that can be reliably used to predict an eclipse for a given location, any accurate prediction would have been down to luck.[7]\\r\\nThe eclipse peaked over the Atlantic Ocean at 3754N 4612W? / ?37.9N 46.2W? / 37.9; -46.2?

This genetically engineered hormone is sometimes given to cows in order to boost milk production, but Ben & Jerrys does not support this practice and is in favor of utilizing less chemically intensive ingredients for the safety of consumers and the environment.[12]\\r\\nIn 1994, Ben & Jerry's: The Inside Scoop, written by Fred \\"Chico\\" Lager, former CEO of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, was published. This book tracks the history of how Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream got started. The book focuses on \\"How Two Real Guys Built a Business with a Social Conscience and a Sense of Humor.\\"[13]\\r\\nIn April 2000, Ben & Jerry's sold the company to Anglo-Dutch multinational food giant Unilever.[14] Unilever said it hopes to carry on the tradition of engaging \\"in these critical, global economic and social missions\\". Although the founders' names are still attached to the product, they do not hold any board or management position and are not involved in day-to-day management of the company.[15]\\r\\nIn 2001, Ben & Jerry's U.S. completed the transition to \\"Eco-Pint\\" packaging, which packaged all pint flavors in environmentally friendly unbleached paperboard Eco-Pint containers, a decision it later reversed. The use of brown-kraft unbleached paperboard had been a critical first step toward a totally biodegradable pint made without added chlorine. Due to what they described as increasing supply, quality, and cost challenges, Ben & Jerry's discontinued their use of the Eco-Pint in 2006, transitioning to a pint container made out of a bleached paperboard that it said was more readily available.[16]\\r\\nOn Earth Day in 2005, when a vote in the U.S. Senate proposed the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, Ben & Jerry's launched a protest by creating the largest ever Baked Alaska, which weighed 900 pounds (410?kg), and placed it in front of the U.S. Capitol Building.[17][18]\\r\\nIn March 2009, \\"CyClone Dairy\\"[19] launched an advertising campaign and a website to promote its milk products, which purportedly came exclusively from cloned cows.[20] On April 1, 2009 (April Fool's Day), Ben & Jerry's announced that it was behind this fake company. Ben & Jerry's had created the tongue-in-cheek hoax to raise awareness of the increasing presence of products from cloned animals within American food[21][22] and to campaign for a tracking system of cloned-animal products.[23] The hoax was revealed on April Fool's Day with the message: \\"We believe you should have the right to choose which foods you eat ÿ and not to eat cloned foods if you dont want to. And that's why Ben & Jerrys believes we need a national clone tracking system, so people and companies can know where their food is coming from.\\"[24]\\r\\nIn 2010, Jostein Solheim, a Unilever executive from Norway, became the new CEO of the company and had this to say about the transition: \\"My mantra that I've repeated a hundred times since starting at Ben & Jerry's is: Change is a wonderful thing,'\\" he said. \\"The world needs dramatic change to address the social and environmental challenges we are facing. Values led businesses can play a critical role in driving that positive change. We need to lead by example, and prove to the world that this is the best way to run a business. Historically, this company has been and must continue to be a pioneer to continually challenge how business can be a force for good and address inequities inherent in global business.\\"[25]\\r\\nOn February 24, 2012, Ben & Jerry's released a new Greek Frozen Yogurt line, which came in several flavors: \\"Strawberry Shortcake\\", \\"Blueberry Vanilla Graham\\", \\"Raspberry Fudge Chunk\\", \\"Banana Peanut Butter\\",[26] and \\"Vanilla\\" (scoop shop exclusive):[27] On April 12, 2013, \\"Pineapple Passionfruit\\", \\"Vanilla Honey Caramel\\", and \\"Liz Lemon\\" were added to the Greek Yogurt line.[28] The Liz Lemon flavor was inspired by a character of the same name created by actress Tina Fey as the main character on the NBC television sitcom 30 Rock.[29]\\r\\nIn 2013, Ben & Jerrys committed to making their products GMO-free in support of mandatory GMO labeling legislation.[30]\\r\\nThe \\"Vermonster\\" is a large ice cream sundae served in a \\"Vermonster Bucket\\" in Ben & Jerry's \\"scoop shops.\\" Its ingredients are 20 scoops of ice cream, 4 bananas, 4 ladles of hot fudge, 3 chocolate chip cookies, 1 chocolate fudge brownie, 10 scoops of walnuts, 2 scoops each of any 4 toppings, and whipped cream. It contains 14,000 calories (kcal), and 500 grams (17.64?oz) of fat. Since 2009, the Vermonster Challenge is an annual charity event held by Ben & Jerry's in which teams of four compete to finish a Vermonster and win free ice cream for a year.[31]\\r\\n\\"Chubby Hubby\\" consists of vanilla malt ice cream swirled with fudge and peanut butter, and containing pretzel nuggets covered in fudge and filled with peanut butter. During the month of September 2009, Ben and Jerry's, in partnership with Freedom to Marry, renamed \\"Chubby Hubby\\" to \\"Hubby Hubby,\\" in celebration of the legalization of same-sex marriage in the company's home state of Vermont. The carton featured the image of two men getting married beneath a rainbow.[32][33][34]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2012, Ben & Jerrys announced it would be changing the name of one of its ice cream flavours in the UK in support of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. \\"Oh! My! Apple Pie!\\" would become \\"Apple-y Ever After\\" and tubs would feature a gay couple atop a wedding cake decorated with rainbows.[35]\\r\\n\\"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough\\" was temporarily renamed \\"I Dough, I Dough\\" in the United States during the summer of 2015. This was in celebration of United States Supreme Court's ruling in support of same-sex marriage. The proceeds from sales were to go to the Human Rights Campaign (a nonprofit advocacy group for LGBT rights).[36]\\r\\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield appeared on The Colbert Report on March 5, 2007, to promote their new ice cream flavor, \\"Stephen Colbert's AmeriCone Dream\\", and Cohen's progressive advocacy group TrueMajority.\\r\\nThe company renamed a flavour, \\"Yes Pecan!\\", in reference to Barack Obama's victory in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. They decided in January 2009 to donate all proceeds made on the sale of that flavor to the Common Cause Education Fund.[37]\\r\\nOn March 2, 2011, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and unveiled their new flavour of ice cream, \\"Late Night Snack\\", whose carton features a picture of Jimmy Fallon on it.[38]\\r\\nOn February 17, 2015, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon and unveiled their new flavor of ice cream, \\"The Tonight Dough\\", which all of its proceeds go to the SeriousFun Children's Network that supports camps for children with major illnesses.[39]\\r\\nIn 2015, Charoset flavoured ice cream became widely available in time for the Passover holiday.[40][41][42][43][44][45]\\r\\nIn April 2015, the company confirmed that it was working on vegan options, after hearing consumers' feedback, led by a petition and FARM organization.[46] In early February 2016, the company announced a new all-vegan line with 4 flavors. Two of these are versions of existing flavors - \\"Chunky Monkey\\" and \\"Chocolate Fudge Brownie\\" - and two are all-new vegan-only flavors: \\"Coffee Caramel Fudge\\" and \\"Peanut Butter & Cookies\\".[47]\\r\\nIn January 2018, the company added two new non-dairy flavors to its growing line of vegan options. Peanut Butter Half Baked features chocolate and peanut butter with fudge brownies and pieces of peanut butter cookie dough, while Cinnamon Buns is made with cinnamon-spiced ice cream and features cinnamon bun dough and a cinnamon streusel swirl.[48]\\r\\nFree Cone Day is an annual event held between late March and early May, in which Ben & Jerry's scoop shops give out free ice cream cups and cones. Free Cone Day was first held on Saturday, May 5, 1979, by Ben and Jerry as a customer and staff appreciation event for the first anniversary of their store's opening.\\r\\nOver one million free cones are given away each year, prompting the company's ad slogan \\"Be One In A Million.\\" Charitable organizations are often present at the stores each year and enjoy a significant amount of fundraising success. Often, local celebrities show up at various stores, promoting the day and the charities there.[49] Sometimes the event is scheduled to coincide with Earth Day and sometimes volunteers are on hand with clipboards and voter registration forms to help those who would like to register to vote.\\r\\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group, urged Ben & Jerry's to stop labeling their ice cream as \\"all natural,\\" due to the company's use of corn syrup, alkalised cocoa, and other chemically modified ingredients.[50] In September 2010, the company agreed to stop labeling their ice cream and frozen yogurt as \\"all natural.\\"[51]\\r\\nIn 2011, Ben & Jerry's released a flavor named Schweddy Balls, in homage to the Saturday Night Live (SNL) skit of the same name. An American group named \\"One Million Moms\\" protested, saying that the name was too explicit for grocery store shelvesspokesperson Monica Cole explained to the media: \\"I realize it could be a lot worse, but are they going to progressively get worse if we don't say something? Maybe they'll think twice before they come up with another inappropriate name for ice cream.\\" However, the expression of disdain was not unanimous among U.S. parents, as mother Gina Ragusa said to The Huffington Post: \\"We just think it's funny, that's all, and honestly we all really want to try it\\", adding that she consistently checks for the item's availability at her local supermarket.[52] Actor Alec Baldwin, who appeared in the SNL skit as baker Pete Schweddy, hosted the September 24, 2011 episode of the 37th season of the show and responded to the protests by stating that a new flavor called \\"Go Fudge Yourself\\" had been produced for those in opposition to the tribute. Following the initial release of the flavor, Baldwin informed the media that \\"thanks to Ben & Jerry's, the goodness of the Schweddy family recipe won't go with me to the great beyond,\\" as he had previously feared that his association with the SNL episode would remain permanent until his death.[53]\\r\\nFollowing rumors that suggested that Ben & Jerry's supported the defense of Mumia Abu-Jamalwho was convicted in 1982 of killing Philadelphia Police officer Daniel Faulkner[54]the company confirmed that Cohen did sign a petition, as a private citizen, asking that \\"the system of American justice be followed fully in the case\\".[55]\\r\\nControversy emerged in 2006 after the company released a flavor of ice cream called \\"Black and Tan\\". It had named the flavor after the alcoholic drink, which is made by mixing stout with pale ale, but the \\"Black and Tans\\" are also known as a paramilitary police force of British World War I veterans recruited during the Irish Revolution. At the time that the flavor was released, the Irish nationalist movement was still offended by the historical association of the title.[56]\\r\\nIn 2012, Vermonters for a Just Peace in Palestine/Israel (VTJP)[57] contacted Ben Cohen, Jerry Greenfield and the CEO of Ben & Jerrys after learning that ice cream produced by Ben & Jerrys franchise in Israel[58] was being sold in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Leafleting occurred at locations in Vermont, New York and California on 'Free Cone Day' in April 2013[59] and April 2014.[60] As of November 2014[update], 232 organizations across the United States and in seventeen countries worldwide have signed a letter written by VTJP calling on Ben & Jerry's to end its commercial ties to such settlements.[61]\\r\\nIn late April 2014, Ben & Jerry's signed onto the \\"Fight for the Reef\\" campaign, a partnership between the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS). Premier Campbell Newman and Queensland state senator Matthew Canavan both said in statements that Ben & Jerry's was making misleading statements that exaggerated the detrimental impact that proposed government programs would have on the Great Barrier Reef,[62][62] and Environment Minister Andrew Powell said that \\"The only people taking a scoop out of the reef is Ben and Jerrys and Unilever. If you understand the facts, youd want to be boycotting Ben and Jerrys\\". Australian Ben & Jerry's brand manager Kalli Swaik responded that \\"Ben & Jerrys believes that dredging and dumping in world heritage waters surrounding the marine park area will be detrimental to the reef ecology. It threatens the health of one of Australias most iconic treasures.\\"[63]\\r\\nIn April 2016, Ben & Jerry's cofounders, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, were both arrested at the Democracy Awakening protests on the U.S. Capitol steps in Washington, D.C.[64]\\r\\nIn May 2017, Ben and Jerry's announced they would not serve two scoops of the same ice cream flavor in Australia, due to the refusal of the Australian government to legalize same-sex marriage. They said this would encourage \\"fans to contact their MP's to tell them the time has come-make marriage equality legal!\\". This stance they said will continue for however long it takes for same-sex marriage to be legalized.[65][66]\\r\\nIn February 2012, a Ben & Jerry's franchise near Harvard University created a limited edition frozen yogurt flavor named \\"Taste the Lin-Sanity,\\" in honor of Asian-American basketball player Jeremy Lin, a Harvard alumnus. At inception, the product contained vanilla frozen yogurt, lychee honey swirls, and fortune cookie pieces, leading to a widely publicized controversy about racial stereotyping due to the association of the fortune cookie ingredient with Chinese culture. The latter ingredient was later replaced with waffle cookies, as the fortune cookies became soggy and the franchise received returns from customers. Ben & Jerry's general manager for Boston and Cambridge explained to the media: \\"we obviously weren't looking to offend anybody and the majority of the feedback about it has been positive.\\"[67] Ben & Jerry's released an official statement shortly after the launch of the product apologizing to those who were offended.[68]\\r\\nIn September 2014, anti-hazing activists raised concerns about the ice cream flavor \\"Hazed & Confused,\\" which had been released earlier that year. The concern was that the name could be perceived as belittling of hazing and bullying problems. The company has noted that the name was based on the word hazelnut and a play on the phrase \\"dazed and confused\\", which is both a song popularized by Led Zeppelin and a coming-of-age comedy film from the early 1990s.[69] The decision was made in October to not rename the flavor.[70]\\r\\nThe Organic Consumers Association announced in July 2017 that it found traces of the herbicide glyphosate in 10 of 11 samples of the companys ice creams.[71] The traces were found to be at levels below the ceiling set by the Environmental Protection Agency for environmental contamination.\\r\\nBen and Jerry's has locations around the world.[72]\\r\\nBen & Jerry's used to have a policy that no employee's rate of pay shall exceed five times that of entry-level employees.[76] In 1995, entry-level employees were paid $12 hourly, and the highest paid employee was President and Chief Operating Officer Chuck Lacy, who earned $150,000 annually. When Ben Cohen resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Ben & Jerry's announced the search for a new CEO in 1995, the company ended the five-to-one-ratio policy.[77]","input":"What is ben and jerry's ice cream slogan?"},{"output":"Hydra","context":"Hydra is the largest of the 88 modern constellations, measuring 1303 square degrees. Also one of the longest at over 100 degrees, its southern end abuts Libra and Centaurus and its northern end borders Cancer.[1] It has a long history, having been included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. It is commonly represented as a water snake. It should not be confused with the similarly named constellation of Hydrus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greek constellation of Hydra is an adaptation of a Babylonian constellation: the MUL.APIN includes a \\"serpent\\" constellation (MUL.DINGIR.MU?) that loosely corresponds to Hydra. It is one of two Babylonian \\"serpent\\" constellations (the other being the origin of the Greek Serpens), a mythological hybrid of serpent, lion and bird.[2]\\r\\nThe shape of Hydra resembles a twisting snake, and features as such in some Greek myths. One myth associates it with a water snake that a crow served Apollo in a cup when it was sent to fetch water; Apollo saw through the fraud, and angrily cast the crow, cup, and snake, into the sky. It is also associated with the monster Hydra, with its many heads, killed by Hercules, represented in another constellation.[3] According to legend, if one of the hydra's heads was cut off, two more would grow in its place. However, Hercules burned out the roots of the heads he severed to prevent them from growing again, and thus overcame the hydra.[4]\\r\\nIn Hindu Mythology the star that equivalents Hydra is Ashlesha.[5] In Chinese astronomy, the stars that correspond to Hydra are located within the Vermilion Bird and the Azure Dragon. In Japanese culture, the stars are known as Nuriko.[citation needed]\\r\\nDespite its size, Hydra contains only one reasonably bright star, Alphard, designated Alpha Hydrae. It is an orange giant of magnitude 2.0, 177 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means \\"the solitary one\\". Beta Hydrae is a blue-white star of magnitude 4.3, 365 light-years from Earth. Gamma Hydrae is a yellow giant of magnitude 3.0, 132 light-years from Earth.[1]\\r\\nHydra has one bright binary star, Epsilon Hydrae, which is difficult to split in amateur telescopes; it has a period of 1000 years and is 135 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 3.4 and the secondary is a blue star of magnitude 6.7. However, there are several dimmer double stars and binary stars in Hydra. 27 Hydrae is a triple star with two components visible in binoculars and three visible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a white star of magnitude 4.8, 244 light-years from Earth. The secondary, a binary star, appears in binoculars at magnitude 7.0 but is composed of a magnitude 7 and a magnitude 11 star; it is 202 light-years from Earth. 54 Hydrae is a binary star 99 light-years from Earth, easily divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is a purple star of magnitude 7.4.[1] N Hydrae (N Hya) is a pair of stars of magnitudes 5.8 and 5.9. Struve 1270 (ҷ1270) consists of a pair of stars, magnitudes 6.4 and 7.4.\\r\\nThe other main named star in Hydra is Sigma, , Hydrae, which also has the name of Minaruja, from the Arabic for snake's nose. At magnitude 4.54, it is rather dim. The head of the snake corresponds to the shlesh Nakshatra, the lunar zodiacal constellation in Indian astronomy.\\r\\nHydra is also home to several variable stars. R Hydrae is a Mira variable star 2000 light-years from Earth; it is one of the brightest Mira variables at its maximum of magnitude 3.5. It has a minimum magnitude of 10 and a period of 390 days. V Hydrae is an unusually vivid red variable star 20,000 light-years from Earth. It varies in magnitude from a minimum of 9.0 to a maximum of 6.6. Along with its notable color, V Hydrae is also home to at least two exoplanets.[6] U Hydrae is a semi-regular variable star with a deep red color, 528 light-years from Earth. It has a minimum magnitude of 6.6 and a maximum magnitude of 4.2; its period is 115 days.[1]\\r\\nThe constellation also contains the radio source Hydra A.\\r\\nHydra contains three Messier objects. M83, also known as the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy, is located on the border of Hydra and Centaurus, M68 is a globular cluster near M83, and M48 is an open star cluster in the western end of the serpent.[1]\\r\\nNGC 3242 is a planetary nebula of magnitude 7.5, 1400 light-years from Earth.[9] Discovered in 1785 by William Herschel, it has earned the nickname \\"Ghost of Jupiter\\" because of its striking resemblance to the giant planet.[10] Its blue-green disk is visible in small telescopes and its halo is visible in larger instruments.[1]\\r\\nM48 (NGC 2548) is an open cluster that is visible to the naked eye under dark skies. Its shape has been described as \\"triangular\\"; this 80-star cluster is unusually large, more than half a degree in diameter, larger than the diameter of the full Moon.[1]\\r\\nThere are several globular clusters in Hydra. M68 (NGC 4590) is a globular cluster visible in binoculars and resolvable in medium amateur telescopes. It is 31,000 light-years from Earth and of the 8th magnitude.[1] NGC 5694 is a globular cluster of magnitude 10.2, 105,000 light-years from Earth. Also called \\"Tombaugh's Globular Cluster\\", it is a Shapley class VII cluster; the classification indicates that it has intermediate concentration at its nucleus. Though it was discovered as a non-stellar object in 1784 by William Herschel, its status as a globular cluster was not ascertained until 1932, when Clyde Tombaugh looked at photographic plates taken of the region near Pi Hydrae on 12 May 1931.[12]\\r\\nM83 (NGC 5236), the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy, is an 8th magnitude face-on spiral galaxy.[1] It is easily observed in skies south of 40N latitude, found by using 1, 2, 3, and 4 Centauri as guide stars.[13] It has been host to six supernovae, more than any Messier object. Large amateur telescopes - above 12 inches aperture - reveal its spiral arms, bar, and small, bright nucleus.[1][13] In a medium-sized amateur instrument, around 8 inches in aperture, the spiral arms become visible under good conditions. It is not perfectly symmetrical in the eyepiece, rather, the northwest side is flattened and the nucleus has a southwest-to-northeast bar. A smaller sister to the Milky Way, it is a grand design spiral galaxy 40,000 light-years across.[13]\\r\\nThere are many other galaxies located in Hydra. NGC 3314, usually delineated as NGC 3314a and NGC 3314b, is a pair of galaxies that appear superimposed, despite the fact that they are not related or interacting in any way. The foreground galaxy, NGC 3314a, is at a distance of 140 million light-years, and is a face-on spiral galaxy. The background galaxy, NGC 3314b, is an oblique spiral galaxy, and has a nucleus that appears reddened because of NGC 3314a's dusty disk.[15] ESO 510-G13 is a warped spiral galaxy located 150 million light-years from Earth. Though most galactic disks are flat because of their rate of rotation, their conformation can be changed, as is the case with this galaxy. Astronomers speculate that this is due to interactions with other galaxies.[15] NGC 5068 may be a member of the M83 group, but its identity is disputed. It has a low surface brightness and has a diameter of 4.5 arcminutes. It is not perfectly circular, rather, it is elliptical and oriented on a west-northwest/east-southeast axis. However, it is of fairly uniform brightness throughout.[16]\\r\\nAnother notable galaxy is NGC 4993, an elliptical galaxy, where it host GW170817, GRB 170817A and SSS17a events from two neutron stars merger.[17][18]\\r\\nThe Sigma Hydrids peak on December 6 and are a very active shower with an unknown parent body.[19] The Alpha Hydrids are a minor shower that peaks between January 1 and 7.[20]\\r\\nCoordinates:  10h 00m 00s, ?20 00 00","input":"What is the name of the largest constellation?"},{"output":"September 20","context":"","input":"When did hurricane maria make landfall in puerto rico?"},{"output":"for  presenting quantitative data in a graphical format","context":"A stem-and-leaf display or stem-and-leaf plot is a device for  presenting quantitative data in a graphical format, similar to a histogram, to assist in visualizing the shape of a distribution. They evolved from Arthur Bowley's work in the early 1900s, and are useful tools in exploratory data analysis. Stemplots became more commonly used in the 1980s after the publication of John Tukey's book on exploratory data analysis in 1977.[1] The popularity during those years is attributable to their use of monospaced (typewriter) typestyles that allowed computer technology of the time to easily produce the graphics. Modern computers' superior graphic capabilities have meant these techniques are less often used.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stem-and-leaf display is also called a stemplot, but the latter term often refers to another chart type.[2]  A simple stem plot may refer to plotting a matrix of y values onto a common x axis, and identifying the common x value with a vertical line, and the individual y values with symbols on the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike histograms, stem-and-leaf displays retain the original data to at least two significant digits, and put the data in order, thereby easing the move to order-based inference and non-parametric statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nA basic stem-and-leaf display contains two columns separated by a vertical line. The left column contains the stems and the right column contains the leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo construct a stem-and-leaf display, the observations must first be sorted in ascending order: this can be done most easily if working by hand by constructing a draft of the stem-and-leaf display with the leaves unsorted, then sorting the leaves to produce the final stem-and-leaf display. Here is the sorted set of data values that will be used in the following example:\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, it must be determined what the stems will represent and what the leaves will represent. Typically, the leaf contains the last digit of the number and the stem contains all of the other digits. In the case of very large numbers, the data values may be rounded to a particular place value (such as the hundreds place) that will be used for the leaves. The remaining digits to the left of the rounded place value are used as the stem.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this example, the leaf represents the ones place and the stem will represent the rest of the number (tens place and higher).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stem-and-leaf display is drawn with two columns separated by a vertical line. The stems are listed to the left of the vertical line. It is important that each stem is listed only once and that no numbers are skipped, even if it means that some stems have no leaves. The leaves are listed in increasing order in a row to the right of each stem.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to note that when there is a repeated number in the data (such as two 72s) then the plot must reflect such (so the plot would look like 7 | 2 2 5 6 7 when it has the numbers 72 72 75 76 77).\\r\\n\\r\\nRounding may be needed to create a stem-and-leaf display. Based on the following set of data, the stem plot below would be created:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor negative numbers, a negative is placed in front of the stem unit, which is still the value X / 10. Non-integers are rounded. This allowed the stem and leaf plot to retain its shape, even for more complicated data sets. As in this example below:\\r\\n\\r\\nStem-and-leaf displays are useful for displaying the relative density and shape of the data, giving the reader a quick overview of distribution. They retain (most of) the raw numerical data, often with perfect integrity. They are also useful for highlighting outliers and finding the mode. However, stem-and-leaf displays are only useful for moderately sized data sets (around 15-150 data points). With very small data sets a stem-and-leaf displays can be of little use, as a reasonable number of data points are required to establish definitive distribution properties. A dot plot may be better suited for such data. With very large data sets, a stem-and-leaf display will become very cluttered, since each data point must be represented numerically. A box plot or histogram may become more appropriate as the data size increase","input":"When is a stem and leaf plot used?"},{"output":"380 AD","context":"Nicene Christianity became the state church of the Roman Empire with the Edict of Thessalonica in 380 AD, when Emperor Theodosius I made it the Empire's sole authorized religion.[1][2] The Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Catholic Church each claim to be the historical continuation of this church in its original form, but do not identify with it in the caesaropapist form that it took later. Unlike Constantine I, who with the Edict of Milan of 313 AD had established tolerance for Christianity without placing it above other religions[3] and whose involvement in matters of the Christian faith extended to convoking councils of bishops who were to determine doctrine and to presiding at their meetings, but not to determining doctrine himself,[4] Theodosius established a single Christian doctrine (specified as that professed by Pope Damasus I of Rome and Pope Peter II of Alexandria) as the Empire's official religion.\\r\\nEarlier in the 4th century, following the Diocletianic Persecution of 303ÿ313 and the Donatist controversy that arose in consequence, Constantine had convened councils of Christian bishops to define the orthodoxy, or \\"correct teaching\\", of the Christian faith, expanding on earlier Christian councils. A series of ecumenical councils met during the 4th and 5th centuries, but Christianity continued to suffer rifts and schisms surrounding the issues of Arianism, Nestorianism, and Miaphysitism. In the 5th century the Western Empire decayed as a polity: invaders sacked Rome in 410 and in 455, and Odoacer, an Arian barbarian warlord, forced Romulus Augustus, the last nominal Western Emperor, to abdicate in 476. However, apart from the aforementioned schisms, the church as an institution persisted in communion, if not without tension, between the east and west. In the 6th century the Byzantine armies of the Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I recovered Italy and other sections of the western Mediterranean shore. The Eastern Roman Empire soon lost most of these gains, but it held Rome, as part of the Exarchate of Ravenna, until 751, a period known in church history as the Byzantine Papacy. The Muslim conquests of the 7th century would begin a process of converting most of the then-Christian world in West Asia and North Africa to Islam, severely restricting the reach both of the Byzantine Empire and of its church. Missionary activity directed from Constantinople, the Byzantine capital, did not lead to a lasting expansion of the formal power of the Empire's state church, since areas outside the empire's political and military control set up their own distinct state churches, as in the case of Bulgaria in 919.\\r\\nJustinian I, who became emperor in Constantinople in 527, established the bishops of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem ÿ referred to[by whom?] as the Pentarchy ÿ as the leadership of the Imperial church and gave each bishop the title of \\"Patriarch\\". However, Justinian saw these bishops as under his tutelage: according to his arrangement, \\"the Emperor was the head of the Church in the sense that he had the right and duty of regulating by his laws the minutest details of worship and discipline, and also of dictating the theological opinions to be held in the Church\\".[5][6] However, by Justinian's day, the churches that now form Oriental Orthodoxy had already seceded from the Imperial state church, while in the west Christianity was mostly subject to the laws and customs of nations that owed no allegiance to the Emperor in Constantinople.[7] While eastern-born popes who were appointed or at least confirmed by the Eastern Emperor continued to be loyal to him as their political lord, they refused to accept his authority in religious matters,[8] or the authority of such a council as the imperially convoked Council of Hieria of 754. Pope Gregory III (731-741) became the last Bishop of Rome to ask the Byzantine ruler to ratify his election.[9][10] By then, the Roman Empire's state church as originally conceived had ceased to exist.[11] In the East, only the largest fragment of the Christian church was under the Emperor's control, and with the crowning of Charlemagne on 25 December 800 AD as Imperator Romanorum by the latter's ally, Pope Leo III, the de facto political split between east and west became irrevocable. Spiritually, the Chalcedonian Church, as a communion broader than the imperial state church, persisted as a unified entity, at least in theory, until the Great Schism and its formal division with the mutual excommunication in 1054 of Rome and Constantinople. Where the Emperor's power remained, the state church developed in a caesaropapist form,[12] although as the Byzantine Empire lost most of its territory to Islam, increasingly the members of the church lived outside the Byzantine state. The Eastern Roman Empire finally collapsed with the Fall of Constantinople to the Islamic Ottoman Turks in 1453.\\r\\nWestern missionary activities created a communion of churches that extended beyond the empire, the beginnings of which predated the establishment of the state church.[citation needed] The obliteration of the Empire's boundaries by Germanic peoples and an outburst of missionary activity among these peoples, who had no direct links with the Eastern Roman Empire, and among Pictic and Celtic peoples who had never been part of the Roman Empire, fostered the idea of a universal church free from association with a particular state.[13] On the contrary, \\"in the East Roman or Byzantine view, when the Roman Empire became Christian, the perfect world order willed by God had been achieved: one universal empire was sovereign, and coterminous with it was the one universal church\\"; and the state church came, by the time of the demise of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, to merge psychologically with it to the extent that its bishops had difficulty in thinking of Christianity without an emperor.[14][15]\\r\\nModern authors refer to this state church in a variety of ways: as the catholic church, the orthodox church, the imperial church, the imperial Roman church, or the Byzantine church, although some of these terms are also used for wider communions extending outside the Roman Empire.[16] The legacy of the idea of a universal church polity carries on, directly or indirectly, in today's Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as in others, such as the Anglican Communion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the end of the 1st century, the Roman authorities recognized Christianity as a separate religion from Judaism. The distinction, perhaps already made in practice at the time of the Great Fire of Rome in the year 64, was given official status by the emperor Nerva around the year 98 by granting Christians exemption from paying the Fiscus Iudaicus, the annual tax upon the Jews. Pliny the Younger, when propraetor in Bithynia in 103, assumes in his letters to Trajan that because Christians do not pay the tax, they are not Jews.[17][18][19]\\r\\nSince paying taxes had been one of the ways that Jews demonstrated their goodwill and loyalty toward the Empire, Christians had to negotiate their own alternatives to participating in the imperial cult. Their refusal to worship the Roman gods or to pay homage to the emperor as divine resulted at times in persecution and martyrdom.[17][18][19] Church Father Tertullian, for instance, attempted to argue that Christianity was not inherently treasonous, and that Christians could offer their own form of prayer for the well-being of the emperor.[20]\\r\\nChristianity spread especially in the eastern parts of the Empire and beyond its border; in the west it was at first relatively limited, but significant Christian communities emerged in Rome, Carthage, and other urban centers, becoming by the end of the 3rd century, the dominant faith in some of them. Christians accounted for approximately 10% of the Roman population by 300, according to some estimates.[21] According to Will Durant, the Christian Church prevailed over paganism because it offered a much more attractive doctrine and because the church leaders addressed human needs better than their rivals.[22]\\r\\nIn 301, the Kingdom of Armenia, which Rome considered de jure a client kingdom though yielded de facto to the Parthians (its ruling dynasty was of Parthian extraction),[23] became the first nation to adopt Christianity as its state church.\\r\\nIn 311, the dying Emperor Galerius ended the Diocletianic Persecution that he is reputed to have instigated, and in 313, Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, granting to Christians and others \\"the right of open and free observance of their worship\\".[28]\\r\\nConstantine began to utilize Christian symbols such as the Chi-Rho early in his reign but still encouraged traditional Roman religious practices including sun worship. In 330, Constantine established the city of Constantinople as the new capital of the Roman Empire. The city would gradually come to be seen as the intellectual and cultural center of the Christian world.[29]\\r\\nOver the course of the 4th century the Christian body became consumed by debates surrounding orthodoxy, i.e. which religious doctrines are the correct ones. In the early 4th century, a group in North Africa, later called Donatists, who believed in a very rigid interpretation of Christianity that excluded many who had abandoned the faith during the Diocletianic persecution, created a crisis in the western Empire.[30]\\r\\nA church synod, or council, was held in Rome in 313, followed by another in Arles in 314, the latter presided over by Constantine while still a junior emperor (see Tetrarchy). These synods ruled that the Donatist faith was heresy and, when the Donatists refused to recant, Constantine launched the first campaign of persecution by Christians against Christians, and began imperial involvement in Christian theology. However, during the reign of Emperor Julian the Apostate, the Donatists, who formed the majority party in the Roman province of Africa for 30 years,[31] were given official approval.[32]\\r\\nChristian scholars and populace within the Empire were increasingly embroiled in debates regarding christology (i.e., regarding the nature of the Christ). Opinions ranged from belief that Jesus was entirely human to belief that he was entirely divine. The most persistent debate was that between the homoousian, or Athanasian, view (the Father and the Son are one and the same, eternal), which was adopted at the council meeting that Constantine called at Nicaea in 325, and the homoiousian, or Arian, view (the Father and the Son are similar, but the Father is greater than the Son). Emperors thereby became ever more involved with the increasingly divided Church.[33]\\r\\nConstantine was of divided opinions (even as to being Christian), but he largely backed the Athanasian side, though he was baptized on his deathbed by the Arian bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia. His successor Constantius II supported a Semi-Arian position. Emperor Julian returned to the traditional (pagan) Roman/Greek religion, quickly quashed by his successor Jovian, a supporter of the Athanasian side.\\r\\nA Council of Rimini in 359 supported the Arian view. A Council of Constantinople in 360 supported a compromise (see Semi-Arianism). The Council of Constantinople in 381, called by Emperor Theodosius I reasserted the Nicene or Athanasian view and rejected the Arian view. This council further refined the definition of orthodoxy, issuing, according to tradition, the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed.\\r\\nOn 27 February of the previous year, Theodosius I established, with the Edict of Thessalonica, the Christianity of the First Council of Nicaea as the official state religion, reserving for its followers the title of Catholic Christians and declaring that those who did not follow the religion taught by Pope Damasus I of Rome and Pope Peter of Alexandria were to be called heretics:[34]\\r\\nIt is our desire that all the various nations which are subject to our Clemency and Moderation, should continue to profess that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter, as it has been preserved by faithful tradition, and which is now professed by the Pontiff Damasus and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness. According to the apostolic teaching and the doctrine of the Gospel, let us believe in the one deity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity. We authorize the followers of this law to assume the title of Catholic Christians; but as for the others, since, in our judgment they are foolish madmen, we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of heretics, and shall not presume to give to their conventicles the name of churches. They will suffer in the first place the chastisement of the divine condemnation and in the second the punishment of our authority which in accordance with the will of Heaven we shall decide to inflict.\\r\\nIn 391, Theodosius closed all the \\"pagan\\" (non-Christian and non-Jewish) temples and formally forbade pagan worship.\\r\\nAt the end of the 4th century the Roman Empire had effectively split into two states although their economies (and the Church, which only then became a state church) were still strongly tied. The two halves of the Empire had always had cultural differences, exemplified in particular by the widespread use of the Greek language in the Eastern Empire and its more limited use in the West (Greek, as well as Latin, was used in the West, but Latin was the spoken vernacular).\\r\\nBy the time the state church of the Empire was established at the end of the 4th century, scholars in the West had largely abandoned Greek in favor of Latin. Even the Church in Rome, where Greek continued to be used in the liturgy longer than in the provinces, abandoned Greek.[35] Jerome's Vulgate had begun to replace the older Latin translations of the Bible.\\r\\nThe 5th century would see further fracturing of the state church of the Roman Empire. Emperor Theodosius?II called two synods in Ephesus, one in 431 and one in 449, the first of which condemned the teachings of Patriarch of Constantinople Nestorius, while the second supported the teachings of Eutyches against Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople.[36]\\r\\nNestorius taught that Christ's divine and human nature were distinct persons, and hence Mary was the mother of Christ but not the mother of God. Eutyches taught on the contrary that there was in Christ only a single nature, different from that of human beings in general. The First Council of Ephesus rejected Nestorius' view, causing churches centered around the School of Edessa, a city at the edge of the empire, to break with the imperial church (see Nestorian schism).[36]\\r\\nPersecuted within the Roman Empire, many Nestorians fled to Persia and joined the Sassanid Church (the future Church of the East). The Second Council of Ephesus upheld the view of Eutyches, but was overturned two years later by the Council of Chalcedon, called by Emperor Marcian. Rejection of the Council of Chalcedon led to the exodus from the state church of the majority of Christians in Egypt and many in the Levant, who preferred miaphysite theology.[36]\\r\\nThus, in addition to losing all the western empire, the state church suffered a significant diminishment even in the east within a century of its setting up. Those who upheld the Council of Chalcedon became known in Syriac as Melkites, the imperial church, followers of the emperor (in Syriac, malka).[37] This schism resulted in an independent communion of churches, including the Egyptian, Syrian, Ethiopian and Armenian churches, that is today known as Oriental Orthodoxy.[38] In spite of these schisms, however, the imperial church still represented the majority of Christians within the by now already diminished Roman Empire.[39]\\r\\nIn the 5th century, the Western Empire rapidly decayed and by the end of the century was no more. Within a few decades, Germanic tribes, particularly the Goths and Vandals, conquered the western provinces. Rome was sacked in 410 and 455, and was to be sacked again in the following century in 546.[27]\\r\\nBy 476 the Germanic chieftain Odoacer had conquered Italy and deposed the last western emperor, Romulus Augustus, though he nominally submitted to the authority of Constantinople. The Arian Germanic tribes established their own systems of churches and bishops in the western provinces but were generally tolerant of the population who chose to remain in communion with the imperial church.[27]\\r\\nIn 533 Roman Emperor Justinian in Constantinople launched a military campaign to reclaim the western provinces from the Arian Germans, starting with North Africa and proceeding to Italy. His success in recapturing much of the western Mediterranean was temporary. The empire soon lost most of these gains, but held Rome, as part of the Exarchate of Ravenna, until 751.\\r\\nJustinian definitively established Caesaropapism,[11] believing \\"he had the right and duty of regulating by his laws the minutest details of worship and discipline, and also of dictating the theological opinions to be held in the Church\\".[5] According to the entry in Liddell & Scott, the term orthodox first occurs in the Codex Justinianus: \\"We direct that all Catholic churches, throughout the entire world, shall be placed under the control of the orthodox bishops who have embraced the Nicene Creed.\\"[40]\\r\\nBy the end of the 6th century the Church within the Empire had become firmly tied with the imperial government,[41] while in the west Christianity was mostly subject to the laws and customs of nations that owed no allegiance to the emperor.[7]\\r\\nEmperor Justinian I assigned to five sees, those of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, a superior ecclesial authority that covered the whole of his empire. The First Council of Nicaea in 325 reaffirmed that the bishop of a provincial capital, the metropolitan bishop, had a certain authority over the bishops of the province.[42] But it also recognized the existing supra-metropolitan authority of the sees of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch,[43] and granted special recognition to Jerusalem.[44][45][46]\\r\\nConstantinople was added at the First Council of Constantinople (381)[47] and given authority initially only over Thrace. By a canon of contested validity,[48] the Council of Chalcedon (451) placed Asia and Pontus,[49] which together made up Anatolia, under Constantinople, although their autonomy had been recognized at the council of 381.[50][51]\\r\\nRome never recognized this pentarchy of five sees as constituting the leadership of the state church. It maintained that, in accordance with the First Council of Nicaea, only the three \\"Petrine\\" sees of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch had a real patriarchal function.[52] The canons of the Quinisext Council of 692, which gave ecclesiastical sanction to Justinian's decree, were also never fully accepted by the Western Church.[53]\\r\\nMuslim conquests of the territories of the patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, most of whose Christians were in any case lost to the imperial state church since the aftermath of the Council of Chalcedon, left in effect only two patriarchates, those of Rome and Constantinople.[54] Then in 740, Emperor Leo the Isaurian reacted to papal resistance to his iconoclast policy by transferring from the jurisdiction of Rome to that of Constantinople all but a minute portion of the then existing empire.[55]\\r\\nThe Patriarch of Constantinople had already adopted the title of \\"ecumenical patriarch\\", indicating what he saw as his position in the oikoumene, the Christian world ideally headed by the emperor and the patriarch of the emperor's capital.[56][57] Also under the influence of the imperial model of governance of the state church, in which \\"the emperor becomes the actual executive organ of the universal Church\\",[58] the pentarchy model of governance of the state church regressed to a monarchy of the Patriarch of Constantinople.[58][59]\\r\\nThe Rashidun conquests began to expand the sway of Islam beyond Arabia in the 7th century, first clashing with the Roman Empire in 634. That empire and the Sassanid Persian Empire were at that time crippled by decades of war between them. By the late 8th century the Umayyad caliphate had conquered all of Persia and much of the Byzantine territory including Egypt, Palestine, and Syria.\\r\\nSuddenly much of the Christian world was under Muslim rule. Over the coming centuries the successive Muslim states became some of the most powerful in the Mediterranean world.\\r\\nThough the state church of the Roman Empire claimed religious authority over Christians in Egypt and the Levant, in reality the majority of Christians in these regions were by then miaphysites and members of other sects that had long been persecuted by Constantinople. The new Muslim rulers, in contrast, offered religious tolerance to Christians of all sects. Additionally subjects of the Muslim Empire could be accepted as Muslims simply by declaring a belief in a single deity and reverence for Muhammad (see shahada). As a result, the peoples of Egypt, Palestine and Syria largely accepted their new rulers and many declared themselves Muslims within a few generations. Muslim incursions later found success in parts of Europe, particularly Spain (see Al-Andalus).[60]\\r\\nDuring the 9th century, the Emperor in Constantinople encouraged missionary expeditions to nearby nations including the Muslim caliphate, and the Turkic Khazars.[citation needed] In 862 he sent Saints Cyril and Methodius to Slavic Great Moravia. By then most of the Slavic population of Bulgaria was Christian and Tsar Boris I himself was baptized in 864. Serbia was accounted Christian by about 870.[61] In early 867 Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople wrote that Christianity was accepted by the Kievan Rus', which however was definitively Christianized only at the close of the following century.\\r\\nOf these, the Church in Great Moravia chose immediately to link with Rome, not Constantinople: the missionaries sent there sided with the Pope during the Photian Schism (863ÿ867).[62] After decisive victories over the Byzantines at Acheloos and Katasyrtai, Bulgaria declared its Church autocephalous and elevated it to the rank of Patriarchate, an autonomy recognized in 927 by Constantinople,[63][64] but abolished by Emperor Basil II Bulgaroktonos (the Bulgar-Slayer) after his 1018 conquest of Bulgaria.\\r\\nIn Serbia, which became an independent kingdom in the early 13th century, Stephen Uro? IV Du?an, after conquering a large part of Byzantine territory in Europe and assuming the title of Tsar, raised the Serbian archbishop to the rank of patriarch in 1346, a rank maintained until after the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks. No Byzantine emperor ever ruled Russian Christianity.\\r\\nExpansion of the Church in western and northern Europe began much earlier, with the conversion of the Irish in the 5th century, the Franks at the end of the same century, the Arian Visigoths in Spain soon afterwards, and the English at the end of the 6th century. By the time the Byzantine missions to central and eastern Europe began, Christian western Europe, in spite of losing most of Spain to Islam, encompassed Germany and part of Scandinavia, and, apart from the south of Italy, was independent of the Byzantine Empire and had been almost entirely so for centuries.\\r\\nThis situation fostered the idea of a universal church linked to no one particular state[13] and of which the state church of the Roman Empire was only part. Long before the Byzantine Empire came to an end, Poland also, Hungary and other central European peoples were part of a Church that in no way saw itself as the empire's state church and that, with the East-West Schism, had even ceased to be in communion with it.\\r\\nWith the defeat and death in 751 of the last Exarch of Ravenna and the end of the Exarchate, Rome ceased to be part of the Byzantine Empire. Forced to seek protection elsewhere,[65] the Popes turned to the Franks and, with the coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III on 25 December 800, transferred their political allegiance to a rival Roman Emperor. More clearly than before, the church in the west, while remaining in communion with the state church of the Byzantine Empire, was not part of it. Disputes between the see of Rome, which claimed authority over all other sees, and that of Constantinople, which was now without rival in the empire, culminated perhaps inevitably[66] in mutual excommunications in 1054.\\r\\nCommunion with Constantinople was broken off by European Christians with the exception of those ruled by the empire (including the Bulgarians and Serbs) and of the fledgling Kievan or Russian Church, then a metropolitanate of the patriarchate of Constantinople. This church became independent only in 1448, just five years before the extinction of the empire,[67] after which the Turkish authorities included all their Orthodox Christian subjects of whatever ethnicity in a single millet headed by the Patriarch of Constantinople.\\r\\nThe Westerners who set up Crusader states in Greece and the Middle East appointed Latin (Western) patriarchs and other hierarchs, thus giving concrete reality and permanence to the schism.[68][69][70] Efforts were made in 1274 (Second Council of Lyon) and 1439 (Council of Florence) to restore communion between East and West, but the agreements reached by the participating eastern delegations and by the Emperor were rejected by the vast majority of Byzantine Christians.\\r\\nIn the East, the idea that the Byzantine emperor was the head of Christians everywhere persisted among churchmen as long as the empire existed, even when its actual territory was reduced to very little. In 1393, only 60 years before the fall of the capital, Patriarch Antony IV of Constantinople wrote to Basil I of Muscovy defending the liturgical commemoration in Russian churches of the Byzantine emperor on the grounds that he was \\"emperor (ϫ??) and autokrator of the Romans, that is of all Christians\\".[71] According to Patriarch Antony, \\"it is not possible among Christians to have a Church and not to have an emperor. For the empire and the Church have great unity and commonality, and it is not possible to separate them\\",[72][73][74] and \\"the holy emperor is not like the rulers and governors of other regions\\".[74][75]\\r\\nFollowing the schism between the Eastern and Western Churches, various emperors sought at times but without success to reunite the Church, invoking the notion of Christian unity between East and West in an attempt to obtain assistance from the Pope and Western Europe against the Muslims who were gradually conquering the empire's territory. But the period of the Western Crusades against the Muslims had passed before even the first of the two reunion councils was held.\\r\\nEven when persecuted by the emperor, the Eastern Church, George Pachymeres said, \\"counted the days until they should be rid not of their emperor (for they could no more live without an emperor than a body without a heart), but of their current misfortunes\\".[76] The state church had come to merge psychologically in the minds of the Eastern bishops with the empire to such an extent that they had difficulty in thinking of Christianity without an emperor.[14]\\r\\nIn Western Europe, on the other hand, the idea of a universal church linked to the Emperor of Constantinople was replaced by that in which the Roman see was supreme.[77] \\"Membership in a universal church replaced citizenship in a universal empire. Across Europe, from Italy to Ireland, a new society centered on Christianity was forming.\\"[78]\\r\\nThe Western Church came to emphasize the term Catholic in its identity, an assertion of universality, while the Eastern Church came to emphasize the term Orthodox in its identity, an assertion of holding to the true teachings of Jesus. Both churches claim to be the unique continuation of the previously united Chalcedonian Church, whose core doctrinal formulations have been retained also by many of the churches that emerged from the Protestant Reformation, including Lutheranism and Anglicanism.","input":"When did christianity become official religion of roman empire?"},{"output":"the 2000 NFL Draft","context":"","input":"When did tom brady come into the league?"},{"output":"SS United States","context":"SS United States is a retired luxury passenger liner built in 1952 for United States Lines. Built at a cost of $79.4 million ($733?million in today's dollars)[1] the ship is the largest ocean liner constructed entirely in the US and the fastest ocean liner to cross the Atlantic in either direction. She was designed by American naval architect William Francis Gibbs, and could be turned into a troopship should the need arise. The United States never was involved in any wars but was operated uninterrupted in transatlantic passenger service until 1969. In the following two decades she went through several different owners, all of whom tried unsuccessfully to make the liner profitable. Over time the ships fittings were sold at auction, and repairs were made that left her almost completely stripped by 1994. Two years later she was towed to Pier 82 on the Delaware River in Philadelphia where she remains today.\\r\\nSince 2009, a group called SS United States Conservancy has been trying to raise funds to save the ship. The group ended up purchasing her in 2011 but has had a few of its plans fall through which included a \\"multi-purpose waterfront complex\\". As the group ran out of money in 2015 it began looking at potentially scrapping the ship, but more donations came in which extended fundraising. This has happened more than once since as the group continues to look at redevelopment plans. The United States still retains the Blue Riband for crossing the Atlantic Ocean as a passenger liner in regular service with the highest average speed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired by the service of the British liners RMS?Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, which transported hundreds of thousands of US troops to Europe during World War II, the US government sponsored the construction of a large and fast merchant vessel that would be capable of transporting large numbers of soldiers. Designed by American naval architect and marine engineer William Francis Gibbs (1886ÿ1967), the liner's construction was a joint effort between the United States Navy and United States Lines. The US government underwrote $50 million of the $78 million construction cost, with the ship's operators, United States Lines, contributing the remaining $28 million. In exchange, the ship was designed to be easily converted in times of war to a troopship with a capacity of 15,000 troops, or to a hospital ship.[10]\\r\\nThe vessel was constructed from 1950ÿ1952 at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Newport News, Virginia. Her keel was laid and the hull constructed in a dry dock. United States was built to exacting Navy specifications, which required that the ship be heavily compartmentalized and have separate engine rooms to optimize wartime survival.[11] A large part of the construction of United States was with prefabricated sections. The ship's hull comprised 183,000 separately fabricated sections.[12]\\r\\nDuring World War II, the French liner SS Normandie had been seized by US authorities at New York and renamed USS Lafayette. In 1942, the liner caught fire while being converted to a troopship by the US Navy. After millions of gallons of water had been pumped into her in an attempt to extinguish the flames she capsized onto her port side and came to rest on the mud of the Hudson River at Pier 88, the site of the current New York Passenger Ship Terminal. As a result of this disaster the design for of the United States incorporated the most rigid U.S. Navy standards.[13] To minimize the risk of fire, the designers of United States used no wood in the ship's framing, accessories, decorations, or interior surfaces. Fittings, including all furniture and fabrics, were custom made in glass, metal, and spun glass fiber to ensure compliance with fireproofing guidelines set by the US Navy. Asbestos-laden paneling was used extensively in interior structures.[14] Specially commissioned artwork included pieces by fourteen artists, including Nathaniel Choate, muralist Austin M. Purves, Jr., and sculptor Gwen Lux. Although the galley did feature a butcher block, the clothes hangers in the luxury cabins were aluminum. The ballroom's grand piano was of a rare, fire-resistant wood speciesalthough originally specified in aluminumand accepted only after a demonstration in which gasoline was poured upon the wood and ignited, without the wood itself igniting.[15]\\r\\nThe construction of the ship's superstructure involved the most use of aluminum in any construction project to that time, and posed a Galvanic corrosion challenge to the builders in joining the aluminum structure to the steel decks below. The extensive use of aluminum provided significant weight savings.[16] United States had the most powerful steam turbines of any merchant marine vessel at the time, with a total power of 240,000 shaft horsepower (180?MW) delivered to four 18-foot (5.5?m) diameter manganese-bronze propellers. The ship was capable of steaming astern at over 20 knots (37?km/h; 23?mph), and could carry enough fuel and stores to steam non-stop for over 10,000 nautical miles (19,000?km; 12,000?mi) at a cruising speed of 35 knots (65?km/h; 40?mph).[17]\\r\\nOn her maiden voyage on July 3, 1952,[clarification needed] United States broke the transatlantic speed record held by RMS Queen Mary for the previous 14 years by over 10 hours, making the maiden crossing from the Ambrose lightship at New York Harbor to Bishop Rock off Cornwall, UK in 3 days, 10 hours, 40 minutes at an average speed of 35.59 knots (65.91?km/h; 40.96?mph). United States' maximum speed was deliberately exaggerated, and kept obscure for many years. An unlikely value of 43 knots (80?km/h; 49?mph) was leaked to reporters by engineers after the first speed trial.[18] A Philadelphia Inquirer article reported the top speed achieved as 36 knots (67?km/h; 41?mph), while another source reports that the highest possible sustained top speed was 35 knots (65?km/h; 40?mph).[19][20]\\r\\nBy the late 1960s, the market for Transatlantic travel by ship had dwindled. America had been sold in 1964, Queen Mary had been retired in 1967, and Queen Elizabeth in 1968. United States was no longer profitable. While United States was at Newport News for annual overhaul in 1969, the shipping line decided to withdraw her from service, leaving the ship docked at the port. After a few years, the ship was relocated to Norfolk, Virginia. Subsequently, ownership passed between several companies.\\r\\nIn 1977, a group headed by Harry Katz sought to purchase the ship and dock it in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where it would be used as a hotel and casino. However, nothing came of the plan.[21] The vessel was sold in the following year for $5 million to a group headed by Richard Hadley who hoped to revitalize the liner in a time share cruise ship format.[22] In 1979, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) was reportedly interested in purchasing the ship and converting her into a cruise ship for cruises in the Caribbean, but decided on purchasing the former SS?France instead. During the 1980s, United States was considered by the US Navy as a troopship or a hospital ship, to be called USS United States, but this plan never materialized.\\r\\nBy 1984, the ship's remaining fittings and furniture were sold at auction in Norfolk. Some of the furniture was installed in Windmill Point, a restaurant in Nags Head, North Carolina. Richard Hadley's plan of a time share style cruise ship eventually failed financially, and the ship was put up for auction by MARAD in 1992. The auction found a new owner named Marmara Marine Inc which was headed by Edward Cantor and Fred Mayer who purchased the ship for $2.6 million (USD). The company was majority-owned by Juliedi Sadikoglu of the Turkish shipping family.[23][24] The ship was towed to Turkey and then Ukraine, where in Sevastopol Shipyard she underwent asbestos removal which lasted from 1993 into 1994.[25] The interior of the ship was almost completely stripped during this time. No viable agreements were reached in the US for a reworking of the vessel, and in 1996 United States was towed to her current location at Pier 84 in South Philadelphia.[26]\\r\\nIn November 1997, Edward Cantor purchased the ship for $6 million.[27] Two years later, the SS United States Foundation and the SS United States Conservancy (then known as the SS United States Preservation Society, Inc.) succeeded in having the ship placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The United States is one of only a handful of ships eligible to enter such service[vague] because of the Passenger Service Act, which requires that any vessel engaged in domestic commerce be built and flagged in the US and operated by a predominantly American crew.\\r\\nIn 2003, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) purchased the ship from the estate of Edward Cantor when the ship was put up for auction after his death, with the stated intent of fully restoring her to a service role in their newly announced American-flagged Hawaiian passenger service called NCL America.[28] In August 2004, NCL commenced feasibility studies regarding a new build-out of the vessel, and in May 2006 Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, chairman of Malaysia-based Star Cruises (which owns NCL), stated that the company's next project is \\"the restoration of the?... United States.\\"[29] Meanwhile, the restaurant (Windmill Point) which had contained some of the original furniture from the United States closed in 2007 so the items were donated to the Mariners' Museum and to Christopher Newport University, both in Newport News, Virginia.[30]\\r\\nA 2007 article in USA Today noted that there had been various projects through the years to celebrate the ship, such as lighting it on special occasions.[31]\\r\\nBy May 2007, an extensive technical review had been completed, with NCL stating that the ship was in sound condition. The cruise line has over 100 boxes of the ship's blueprints cataloged. While this documentation is not complete, NCL believed it would provide useful information for the planned refit.[32] When NCL America began operation though, it used Pride of America, Pride of Aloha, and Pride of Hawaii, rather than United States, and later withdrew Pride of Aloha and Pride of Hawaii from its Hawaiian service. In February 2009, it was reported that Star Cruises, to whom United States's ownership was transferred, and NCL were looking for buyers for the liner.[33][34] The SS United States Conservancy was then created that year as a group trying to save United States by raising funds to purchase her.[35] On July 30, 2009, H. F. Lenfest, a Philadelphia media entrepreneur and philanthropist, pledged a matching grant of $300,000 to help the United States Conservancy purchase the vessel from Star Cruises.[36] A noteworthy supporter, former US president Bill Clinton, has also endorsed rescue efforts to save the ship, having sailed on her himself in 1968.[11][37]\\r\\nIn March 2010 it was reported that scrapping bids for the ship were being collected. Norwegian Cruise Lines, in a press release, noted that there are large costs associated with keeping United States afloat in her current statearound $800,000 a yearand that, as the SS United States Conservancy has not been able to tender an offer for the ship, the company was actively seeking a \\"suitable buyer.\\"[38] By May 7, 2010, over $50,000 had been raised by The SS United States Conservancy.[39] A deal was finally struck with NCL on July 1, 2010 to buy SS United States for a reported $3 million (USD) despite a scrapper's bid for $5.9 million.[citation needed] The Conservancy was given until February, 2011 to buy the ship and satisfy Environmental Protection Agency concerns related to toxins on the ship. The group had funds to last 20 months (from July 1, 2010) that were to go to supporting a development plan to clean the ship of toxins and make the ship financially self-supporting as possibly a hotel or development project.[8][40] SS United States Conservancy executive director Dan McSweeney stated that he planned on placing the ship at possible locations that include Philadelphia, New York City and Miami.[8][41]\\r\\nIn November 2010, the Conservancy announced a plan to develop a \\"multi-purpose waterfront complex\\" with hotels, restaurants and a casino along the Delaware River in South Philadelphia at the proposed location for the stalled Foxwoods Casino project. A detailed study for the site was revealed in late November 2010, in advance of Pennsylvania's December 10, 2010 deadline for a deal aimed at Harrah's Entertainment taking over the casino project. The deal soon fell through though when on December 16, 2010, the Gaming Control Board voted to revoke the casino's license.[42][43]\\r\\nThe SS United States Conservancy assumed ownership of United States on February 1, 2011.[6][44] Talks about possible locations in Philadelphia, New York City and Miami continued into March. In New York City, negotiations with a developer were underway for the ship to become part of the Vision 2020, a waterfront redevelopment plan totaling US$3.3 billion. In Miami, Ocean Group in Coral Gables were also interested in putting the ship in a slip on the north side of American Airlines Arena.[45][46] With an additional US$5.8 million donation from H. F. Lenfest, the conservancy had about 18 months from March 2011 to make the ship a public attraction.[46] On August 5, 2011 the SS United States Conservancy announced that after conducting two studies focused on placing the ship in Philadelphia it was \\"not likely to work there for a variety of reasons.\\" However, discussions to place the ship in her original home port of New York as a stationary attraction were reported to be ongoing.[47] The Conservancy's grant specifies that the refit and restoration must be done in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for the benefit of the Philadelphia economy, regardless of her eventual mooring site; the Conservancy continued to negotiate with possible stakeholders in the New York area.\\r\\nOn February 7, 2012 preliminary work began on the restoration project to prepare the ship for her eventual rebuild, although a contract had not yet been signed.[48] In April 2012, a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) was released as the start of an aggressive search for a developer for the ship. A Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued in May.[49] In July 2012, the SS United States Conservancy launched a new online campaign called \\"Save the United States\\", a blend of social networking and micro-fundraising, that allowed donors to sponsor square inches of a virtual ship for redevelopment, while allowing them to upload photos and story content about their experience with the ship. The Conservancy announced that donors to the virtual ship would be featured in an interactive \\"Wall of Honor\\" aboard the future SS United States museum.[50][51] Six million (USD) had been raised by September 2012 to turn the ship into a permanent waterfront attraction.[52]\\r\\nA developer was to be chosen by the end of 2012 with the intent of putting the ship in a selected city by summer 2013. The ship, however, remained in Philadelphia.[53] In November 2013, it was reported that the ship was undergoing a \\"below-the-deck\\" makeover which lasted into 2014 in order to make the ship more appealing for developers as a dockside attraction. The SS United States Conservancy was warned though that if its plans did not come together quickly, there might be no choice but to sell the ship for scrap.[54] In January 2014, obsolete pieces of the ship were sold to keep up with the $80,000 (USD) a month maintenance costs. Enough money was raised to keep the ship going for another six months with the hope of finding someone committed to the project, with New York City still being the frontrunner target location.[55] On July 3, 2014, The SS United States Conservancy held a flag-raising ceremony commemorating the ship's maiden voyage. An American flag was raised first to honor Independence Day, then the house flag of the ship's former operating company, United States Lines (donated by the trademark owner Hector L. Aponte III) was raised. This occasion was the first time the ship had flown its company flag since the ship was decommissioned in 1969.[56]\\r\\nBy August 2014, the ship was still moored in Philadelphia and costs for the ship's rent amounted to $60,000 (USD) a month. It was estimated that it would take one billion (USD) to put the United States back on the high seas, though a 2016 estimate for restoration as a luxury cruise ship was said to be, \\"as much as $700 million\\".[57][58] On September 4, 2014 a final push was made to have the ship be bound for New York City. A developer interested in re-purposing the ship into a major waterfront destination made an announcement regarding the move. The Conservancy had only weeks to decide if the ship needed to be sold for scrap.[59] On December 15, 2014, preliminary agreements in support of the redevelopment of the SS United States were announced. The agreements included three months of carrying costs, with a timeline and more details to be released sometime in 2015.[60][61] In February 2015, another $250,000 was received by the conservancy from an anonymous donor which went towards planning an onboard museum.[62]\\r\\nAs of October 2015 the SS United States Conservancy had begun exploring potential bids for scrapping the ship. The group was running out of money to cover the $60,000 per month cost to dock and maintain the ship. Attempts to repurpose the ship continued. Potential ideas included using the ship for hotels, restaurants, or office space. One idea floated was to install computer servers in the lower decks and link them to software development businesses in office space on the upper decks. However, no firm plans were announced. The conservancy said that if no progress was made by October 31, 2015, they would have no choice but to sell the ship to a \\"responsible recycler.\\"[63] As the deadline passed it was announced that $100,000 had been raised in October 2015 sparing the ship from immediate danger. By November 23, 2015 it was reported that over $600,000 in donations had been received for care and upkeep, buying time well into the coming year for the SS United States Conservancy to press ahead with a plan to redevelop the vessel.[64]\\r\\nOn February 4, 2016, Crystal Cruises announced that it had signed a purchase option for the SS United States. Crystal would cover docking costs in Philadelphia for nine months while conducting a feasibility study on returning the ship to service as a cruise ship based in New York City.[65][66] It was announced on April 9, 2016 that 600 artifacts from the SS United States would be returned to the ship from the Mariners' Museum, and other donors.[67]\\r\\nThe plan was formally dropped on August 5, 2016, citing too many technical and commercial challenges. Crystal Cruises then made a donation of $350,000 to help with preservation through the end of the year.[68][69][70] The SS United States Conservancy continued to receive donations which include one for $150,000 by cruise industry executive Jim Pollin. This is expected to last the group's fund raising campaign into mid-September 2017.[71] If the group runs out of money, alternative plans for recycling the ship include turning the United States into an artificial reef rather than scrapping her.[71]\\r\\nDecor included a children's playroom designed by Edward Meshekoff.[72] Other artwork was designed by Charles Gilbert of Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. His work included glass panels in the ballroom, a clock in the Captain's quarters, and other pieces. Much of his work was purchased at auction when the ship was drydocked. Several of the glass panels are highlighted in an exhibit at Southdown Museum in Houma, Louisiana.\\r\\nOne of the ship's 60,000-pound propellers is mounted at the entrance to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York City. Another one stands on a platform near the waterfront at SUNY Maritime College at Fort Schuyler, New York. Across the Long Island Sound from SUNY Maritime College, a third propeller is mounted at the United States Merchant Marine Academy and is used as a teaching aid for merchant mariners. In 2008 a fourth propeller was put on display at the entrance of the Mariner's Museum in Newport News, Virginia.[73]\\r\\nIn addition to breaking the eastbound transatlantic speed record held by RMS Queen Mary, the liner also broke the westbound crossing record by returning to America in 3 days 12 hours and 12 minutes at an average speed of 34.51 knots (63.91?km/h; 39.71?mph). With both the eastbound and westbound speed records, the United States obtained the Blue Riband which marked the first time a US-flagged ship had held the record since the SS?Baltic claimed the prize 100 years earlier. United States maintained a 30 knots (56?km/h; 35?mph) crossing speed on the North Atlantic in a service career that lasted 17 years. United States lost the eastbound speed record in 1990 to Hoverspeed Great Britain; however, she continues to hold the Blue Riband as all subsequent record breakers were neither in passenger service nor were their voyages westbound.[74]\\r\\nA television documentary about the ship, titled SS United States: Lady in Waiting, was completed in early February 2008 and was distributed through Chicago's WTTW TV and American Public Television with the first airings in May 2008 on PBS stations throughout the US.[75] The Big U: The Story of the SS United States, another documentary about the ship, was in development by Rock Creek Productions.[76] The 2013 film Dead Man Down starring Colin Farrell features scenes shot on board United States.[77]\\r\\nPostcard of SS United States\\r\\nSS United States at sea, 1950s\\r\\nSun deck of SS United States during 1964 eastbound voyage\\r\\nSS United States disembarking at Le Havre in 1964\\r\\nSS United States in dock at Pier 86 in New York the morning of July 31, 1964 sailing to Le Havre and Southampton\\r\\nSS United States laid up in Hampton Roads, 1989\\r\\nSS United States bow at Pier 82, Philadelphia, from a kayak\\r\\nSS United States from a cruise ship on the Delaware River","input":"What is the old cruise ship in philadelphia?"},{"output":"sugar in the absence of oxygen","context":"Fermentation is a metabolic process that consumes sugar in the absence of oxygen. The products are organic acids, gases, or alcohol. It occurs in yeast and bacteria, and also in oxygen-starved muscle cells, as in the case of lactic acid fermentation. The science of fermentation is known as zymology.\\r\\nIn microorganisms, fermentation is the primary means of producing ATP by the degradation of organic nutrients anaerobically.[1] Humans have used fermentation to produce drinks and beverages since the Neolithic age. For example, fermentation is used for preservation in a process that produces lactic acid as found in such sour foods as pickled cucumbers, kimchi and yogurt (see fermentation in food processing), as well as for producing alcoholic beverages such as wine (see fermentation in winemaking) and beer. Fermentation occurs within the gastrointestinal tracts of all animals, including humans.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFermentation turns NADH and pyruvate produced in glycolysis into NAD+ and an organic product (which varies depending on the type of fermentation; see examples below). In the presence of O2, NADH and pyruvate are used to generate ATP in respiration. This is called oxidative phosphorylation, and it generates much more ATP than glycolysis alone. For that reason, fermentation is rarely utilized when oxygen is available. The exception being obligate anaerobes, which cannot tolerate oxygen.\\r\\nThe first step, Embden-Meyerof-Parnas glycolysis, is common to many fermentation pathways:\\r\\nPyruvate is CH3COCO2?. Pi is inorganic phosphate. Two ADP molecules and two Pi are converted to two ATP and two water molecules via substrate-level phosphorylation. Two molecules of NAD+ are also reduced to NADH.[3]\\r\\nIn oxidative phosphorylation, the energy for ATP formation is derived from an electrochemical proton gradient generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane (or, in the case of bacteria, the plasma membrane) via an electron transport chain. Glycolysis has substrate-level phosphorylation (ATP generated directly at the point of reaction).\\r\\nFermentation simply means the production of alcohol: grains and fruits are fermented to produce beer and wine. If a food soured, one might say it was 'off' or fermented. Here are some definitions of fermentation. They range to informal, general usage to more scientific definitions.[4]\\r\\nFermentation is a process which does not necessarily have to be carried out in an anaerobic environment. For example, even in the presence of abundant oxygen, yeast cells greatly prefer fermentation to aerobic respiration, as long as sugars are readily available for consumption (a phenomenon known as the Crabtree effect).[5] The antibiotic activity of hops also inhibits aerobic metabolism in yeast[citation needed].\\r\\nFermentation reacts NADH with an endogenous, organic electron acceptor.[1] Usually this is pyruvate formed from the sugar during the glycolysis step. During fermentation, pyruvate is metabolized to various compounds through several processes:\\r\\nSugars are the most common substrate of fermentation, and typical examples of fermentation products are ethanol, lactic acid, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen gas (H2). However, more exotic compounds can be produced by fermentation, such as butyric acid and acetone.\\r\\nAlthough yeast carries out the fermentation in the production of ethanol in beers, wines, and other alcoholic drinks, this is not the only possible agent: bacteria carry out the fermentation in the production of xanthan gum, while mammalian muscle carries out the fermentation that occurs during periods of intense exercise where oxygen supply becomes limited, resulting in the creation of lactic acid.[6]\\r\\nFermentation products contain chemical energy (they are not fully oxidized), but are considered waste products, since they cannot be metabolized further without the use of oxygen.\\r\\nThe chemical equation below shows the alcoholic fermentation of glucose, whose chemical formula is C6H12O6.[8] The reaction is catalysed by the enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase.One glucose molecule is converted into two ethanol molecules and two carbon dioxide molecules:\\r\\nC2H5OH is the chemical formula for ethanol.\\r\\nBefore fermentation takes place, one glucose molecule is broken down into two pyruvate molecules. This is known as glycolysis.[8][9]\\r\\nHomolactic fermentation (producing only lactic acid) is the simplest type of fermentation. The pyruvate from glycolysis[10] undergoes a simple redox reaction, forming lactic acid.[3][11] It is unique because it is one of the only respiration processes to not produce a gas as a byproduct. Overall, one molecule of glucose (or any six-carbon sugar) is converted to two molecules of lactic acid: C6H12O6 L 2 CH3CHOHCOOH\\r\\nIt occurs in the muscles of animals when they need energy faster than the blood can supply oxygen. It also occurs in some kinds of bacteria (such as lactobacilli) and some fungi. It is the type of bacteria that converts lactose into lactic acid in yogurt, giving it its sour taste. These lactic acid bacteria can carry out either homolactic fermentation, where the end-product is mostly lactic acid, or\\r\\nHeterolactic fermentation, where some lactate is further metabolized and results in ethanol and carbon dioxide[3] (via the phosphoketolase pathway), acetate, or other metabolic products, e.g.: C6H12O6 L CH3CHOHCOOH + C2H5OH + CO2\\r\\nIf lactose is fermented (as in yogurts and cheeses), it is first converted into glucose and galactose (both six-carbon sugars with the same atomic formula): C12H22O11 + H2O L 2 C6H12O6\\r\\nHeterolactic fermentation is in a sense intermediate between lactic acid fermentation, and other types, e.g. alcoholic fermentation (see below). The reasons to go further and convert lactic acid into anything else are:\\r\\nIn aerobic respiration, the pyruvate produced by glycolysis is oxidized completely, generating additional ATP and NADH in the citric acid cycle and by oxidative phosphorylation. However, this can occur only in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen is toxic to organisms that are obligate anaerobes, and is not required by facultative anaerobic organisms. In the absence of oxygen, one of the fermentation pathways occurs in order to regenerate NAD+; lactic acid fermentation is one of these pathways.[3]\\r\\nHydrogen gas is produced in many types of fermentation (mixed acid fermentation, butyric acid fermentation, caproate fermentation, butanol fermentation, glyoxylate fermentation), as a way to regenerate NAD+ from NADH. Electrons are transferred to ferredoxin, which in turn is oxidized by hydrogenase, producing H2.[8] Hydrogen gas is a substrate for methanogens and sulfate reducers, which keep the concentration of hydrogen low and favor the production of such an energy-rich compound,[12] but hydrogen gas at a fairly high concentration can nevertheless be formed, as in flatus.\\r\\nAs an example of mixed acid fermentation, bacteria such as Clostridium pasteurianum ferment glucose producing butyrate, acetate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas:[13] The reaction leading to acetate is:\\r\\nGlucose could theoretically be converted into just CO2 and H2, but the global reaction releases little energy.\\r\\nAcetic acid can also undergo a dismutation reaction to produce methane and carbon dioxide:[14][15]\\r\\nThis disproportionation reaction is catalysed by methanogen archaea in their fermentative metabolism. One electron is transferred from the carbonyl function (e? donor) of the carboxylic group to the methyl group (e? acceptor) of acetic acid to respectively produce CO2 and methane gas.\\r\\nThe use of fermentation, particularly for beverages, has existed since the Neolithic and has been documented dating from 7000ÿ6600 BCE in Jiahu, China,[16] 5000 BCE in India, Ayurveda mentions many Medicated Wines, 6000 BCE in Georgia,[17] 3150 BCE in ancient Egypt,[18] 3000 BCE in Babylon,[19] 2000 BCE in pre-Hispanic Mexico,[19] and 1500 BC in Sudan.[20] Fermented foods have a religious significance in Judaism and Christianity. The Baltic god Rugutis was worshiped as the agent of fermentation.[21][22]\\r\\nThe first solid evidence of the living nature of yeast appeared between 1837 and 1838 when three publications appeared by C. Cagniard de la Tour, T. Swann, and F. Kuetzing, each of whom independently concluded as a result of microscopic investigations that yeast is a living organism that reproduces by budding. It is perhaps because wine, beer, and bread were each basic foods in Europe that most of the early studies on fermentation were done on yeasts, with which they were made. Soon, bacteria were also discovered; the term was first used in English in the late 1840s, but it did not come into general use until the 1870s, and then largely in connection with the new germ theory of disease.[23]\\r\\nLouis Pasteur (1822ÿ1895), during the 1850s and 1860s, showed that fermentation is initiated by living organisms in a series of investigations.[11] In 1857, Pasteur showed that lactic acid fermentation is caused by living organisms.[24] In 1860, he demonstrated that bacteria cause souring in milk, a process formerly thought to be merely a chemical change, and his work in identifying the role of microorganisms in food spoilage led to the process of pasteurization.[25] In 1877, working to improve the French brewing industry, Pasteur published his famous paper on fermentation, \\"Etudes sur la Bire\\", which was translated into English in 1879 as \\"Studies on fermentation\\".[26] He defined fermentation (incorrectly) as \\"Life without air\\",[27] but correctly showed that specific types of microorganisms cause specific types of fermentations and specific end-products.\\r\\nAlthough showing fermentation to be the result of the action of living microorganisms was a breakthrough, it did not explain the basic nature of the fermentation process, or prove that it is caused by the microorganisms that appear to be always present. Many scientists, including Pasteur, had unsuccessfully attempted to extract the fermentation enzyme from yeast.[27] Success came in 1897 when the German chemist Eduard Buechner ground up yeast, extracted a juice from them, then found to his amazement that this \\"dead\\" liquid would ferment a sugar solution, forming carbon dioxide and alcohol much like living yeasts.[28] Buechner's results are considered to mark the birth of biochemistry. The \\"unorganized ferments\\" behaved just like the organized ones. From that time on, the term enzyme came to be applied to all ferments. It was then understood that fermentation is caused by enzymes that are produced by microorganisms.[29] In 1907, Buechner won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work.[30]\\r\\nAdvances in microbiology and fermentation technology have continued steadily up until the present. For example, in the late 1970s, it was discovered that microorganisms could be mutated with physical and chemical treatments to be higher-yielding, faster-growing, tolerant of less oxygen, and able to use a more concentrated medium.[31] Strain selection and hybridization developed as well, affecting most modern food fermentations. Other approaches to advancing the fermentation industry has been done by companies such as BioTork, a biotechnology company that naturally evolves microorganisms to improve fermentation processes. This approach differs from the more popular genetic modification, which has become the current industry standard.\\r\\nThe word \\"ferment\\" is derived from the Latin verb fervere, which means to boil. It is thought to have been first used in the late 14th century in alchemy, but only in a broad sense. It was not used in the modern scientific sense until around 1600.","input":"What is necessary for a substance to undergo fermentation?"},{"output":"Airbus A320 family aircraft","context":"Spirit Airlines, Inc.

The airline operates bases at Atlantic City, ChicagoÿO'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, and Las Vegas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company initially started as Clipper Trucking Company in 1964.[4] The company changed its name to Ground Air Transfer, Inc., in 1974. The airline service was founded in 1980 in Macomb County, Michigan, by Ned Homfeld as Charter One, a Detroit-based charter tour operator providing travel packages to entertainment destinations such as Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and the Bahamas. In 1990, Charter One began scheduled service from Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, to Atlantic City. On May 29, 1992, Charter One brought jet aircraft into the fleet and changed its name to Spirit Airlines.[5][6] Scheduled flights between Detroit and Atlantic City began on June 1, 1992.[6] Scheduled flights between Boston and Providence began on June 15, 1992.[6]\\r\\nOn April 2, 1993, Spirit Airlines began scheduled service to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and St. Petersburg, Florida.[6] Flights between Atlantic City and Fort Myers, Florida, began on September 25, 1993.[7] Service at Philadelphia began in 1994.[8] During the next five years, Spirit expanded further, increasing service from Detroit and adding service in new markets such as Myrtle Beach, Los Angeles, and New York City.\\r\\nIn the summer of 1994, Spirit Airlines overbooked flights, and 1,400 customers' tickets were canceled.[9] The overbooking occurred because Spirit Airlines had given incorrect instructions to travel agents, causing those tickets not to be valid, even though the customers had paid for the flights.[9] In response to criticism, Spirit Airlines said it would make sure all paid customers would always be able to fly to their destination, even if Spirit Airlines had to book them on a competitor's airline.[9]\\r\\nSpirit initially had their headquarters in Eastpointe, Michigan (formerly East Detroit) in Metro Detroit.[10] It relocated its headquarters in November 1999, moving to Miramar, Florida in the Miami Metropolitan Area.[11] Prior to the decision to move the headquarters to Miramar, Spirit considered Atlantic City, New Jersey and Detroit, Michigan.[12]\\r\\nIn 2000, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) fined Spirit Airlines $67,000 for allegedly violating federal regulations on cabin and seat markings and placards.[13] Discrepancies were found in the marking and placarding of emergency equipment, passenger seats, storage areas and doors on eight of Spirit's DC9 and MD80 aircraft.[14][15]\\r\\nIn November 2001, Spirit inaugurated service to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and implemented a fully integrated Spanish-language customer service plan including a website and dedicated reservation line.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the fall of 2003, Spirit resumed flights to Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which were suspended after the September 11 attacks. Spirit also began service to Grand Cayman, San Francisco, and Boston in 2006, and in 2007 filed DOT applications to offer service to Costa Rica, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles and Venezuela.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2006, Spirit exercised options to order 30 Airbus A320-200 aircraft for further expansion. Deliveries began in March 2010.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn March 6, 2007, Spirit began a transition to an ultra low-cost carrier, following a fare model that decoupled amenities that are often included in the base ticket price of traditional carriers. Passengers who wanted to customize their itinerary or flight experience paid an add-on fee for each additional feature, which enabled the carrier to earn ancillary revenue in excess of 40% of total revenue.[16] These included having an agent print a boarding pass at check-in versus doing it online or at a kiosk,[17] for any large carry-on or checked bags, progressive fees for overweight bags, selected seat assignments, travel insurance, and more.[18] In 2011, Spirit Airlines became the first U.S. airline to charge passengers for carry-on bags. They were later followed by Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn June 3, 2008, Spirit Airlines made a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notice) application to potentially relocate or lay off hundreds of pilots and flight attendants, and the closure of their San Juan and LaGuardia crew bases.[19] In September 2008, Spirit began advertising on the side of aircraft, overhead bins, tray tables, seatback inserts and bulkheads.[20]\\r\\nIn May 2009, after more than four years of inconclusive negotiations between the airline and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), Spirit pilots overwhelmingly (98% of votes) voted in favor of strike action over compensation, work rules and benefits. At that time, Spirit pilots were among the lowest paid Airbus pilots in the United States. On June 12, 2010, Spirit grounded its flights when its unionized pilots walked out on strike, stranding thousands of passengers. This was the first passenger airline strike by American ALPA-represented pilots since Comair in 2001.[21][22] On June 15, negotiations between the airline and ALPA resumed, and a tentative agreement was reached late in the evening on June 16. The tentative agreement, which Spirit pilots later ratified by a 74% margin, brought Spirit pilots' compensation and benefits in line with comparable Airbus operators in the US.

Mardi Gras is French for \\"Fat Tuesday\\", reflecting the practice of the last night of eating richer, fatty foods before the ritual fasting of the Lenten season.\\r\\nRelated popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting and religious obligations associated with the penitential season of Lent. In countries such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is also known as Shrove Tuesday, which is derived from the word shrive, meaning \\"confess\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe festival season varies from city to city, as some traditions, such as the one in New Orleans, Louisiana, consider Mardi Gras to stretch the entire period from Twelfth Night (the last night of Christmas which begins Epiphany) to Ash Wednesday.[6][7] Others treat the final three-day period before Ash Wednesday as the Mardi Gras.[8] In Mobile, Alabama, Mardi Gras-associated social events begin in November, followed by mystic society balls on Thanksgiving,[6][9] then New Year's Eve, followed by parades and balls in January and February, celebrating up to midnight before Ash Wednesday. In earlier times, parades were held on New Year's Day.[6] Other cities famous for Mardi Gras celebrations include Rio de Janeiro; Barranquilla, Colombia; George Town, Cayman Islands; Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago; Quebec City, Quebec, Canada; and Mazatln, Sinaloa, Mexico.\\r\\nCarnival is an important celebration in Anglican and Catholic European nations.[1] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the week before Ash Wednesday is called \\"Shrovetide\\", ending on Shrove Tuesday. It has its popular celebratory aspects, as well. Pancakes are a traditional food. Pancakes and related fried breads or pastries made with sugar, fat, and eggs are also traditionally consumed at this time in many parts of Latin America and the Caribbean.\\r\\nIn the Belgian city of Binche, the Mardi Gras festival is one of the most important days of the year and the summit of the Carnival of Binche. Around 1000 Gilles dance throughout the city from morning until past dusk, whilst traditional carnival songs play. In 2003, the \\"Carnival of Binche\\" was proclaimed one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.\\r\\nCarnival is the most famous Brazilian holiday. During this time, Brazil attracts 70% of its tourists. Variations in carnival celebrations are observed throughout the multitude of Brazilian cities. Yet, a commonality observed among them is the incorporation of samba into the celebrations. The southeastern cities of Brazil have massive parades that take place in large sambadromes. The Rio Carnival is where two million people celebrate in the city. The city of Salvador holds a very large carnival celebration where millions of people celebrate the party in the streets of the city with a very big diversity of musical styles together.\\r\\nCayman Mardi Gras hosts a festive Monday Food Festival as well as an Ash Wednesday.\\r\\nCarnaval de Barranquilla is Colombia's Mardi Gras celebration. In 2003, it was proclaimed as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.\\r\\nIn the Czech Republic it is a folk tradition to celebrate Mardi Gras, which is called Masopust (meat-fast i.e. beginning of fast there). There are celebration in many places including Prague[10] but the tradition also prevails in the villages such as Star Hamry, whose the door-to-door processions there made it to the UNESCO World Intangible Cultural Heritage List.[11]\\r\\nCarnival parades take place in many cities including Dunkerque, Granville, Sarreguemines as well as in the French Caribbean islands Guadeloupe and Martinique.\\r\\nThe Nice Carnival is held annually in Nice on the French Riviera. The earliest records establish its existence in 1294 when the Count of Provence, Charles Anjou, wrote that he had passed \\"the joyous days of carnival.\\"This may make the Nice Carnival the original carnival celebration. Today the event attracts over a million visitors to Nice every year over a two-week period.\\r\\nThe celebration on the same day in Germany knows many different terms, such as Schmutziger Donnerstag or Fetter Donnerstag (Fat Thursday), Unsinniger Donnerstag, Weiberfastnacht, Greesentag and others, and are often only one part of the whole carnival events during one or even two weeks before Ash Wednesday be called Karneval, Fasching, or Fastnacht among others, depending on the region. In standard German, schmutzig means \\"dirty\\", but in the Alemannic dialects schmotzig means \\"lard\\" (Schmalz), or \\"fat\\";[12] \\"Greasy Thursday\\", as remaining winter stores of lard and butter used to be consumed at that time, before the fasting began. Fastnacht means \\"Eve of the Fast\\", but all three terms cover the whole carnival season. The traditional start of the carnival season is on November 11 at 11:11 am (11/11 11:11).\\r\\nIn Italy Mardi Gras is called Marted Grasso (Fat Tuesday). It's the main day of Carnival along with the Thursday before, called Gioved Grasso (Fat Thursday), which ratifies the start of the celebrations. The most famous Carnivals in Italy are in Venice, Viareggio and Ivrea. Ivrea has the characteristic \\"Battle of Oranges\\" that finds its roots in medieval times. The Italian version of the festival is spelled Carnevale.[13]\\r\\nThe Netherlands also has a festival similar to Mardi Gras. It's called Carnaval and is similar to the Venice Carnival. The origin of the word Carnaval is carnem levare which means \\"to take away meat\\" in Latin, or carne vale, Latin for \\"farewell to meat\\". It marks the beginning of Lent (March 1, 2017) leading up to Easter\\r\\nThe carnival in the Netherlands is mainly held in the southern part of the Netherlands in the provinces of Noord-Brabant and Limburg, some parts of Zeeland and in eastern parts of Twente and Gelderland. As with many popular festivals, people tend to loosen some moral codes and become laid-back or loose, which is based in the ancient role-reversal origins of Carnaval, including dressing in costumes.\\r\\nBoth Russia and Ukraine have the festival of Maslenitsa (󶶿ҳ, rus.), which on its pagan side celebrates the end of winter and the upcoming summer, and on its Christian side marks the last week before the Great Fasting period before Christian Easter. The festival includes family gatherings with festive meals and treats of bliny (crepes) that resemble the round shape of sun, and culminates on the weekend with mass outdoors gatherings, festivities and entertaining activities such as pole climbing, where a wheel with variety of presents is affixed on the top of a long pole and the contestants need to reach the top to get them. Also the festival's mascot - a feminine figure made out of straw, which symbolizes winter, gets put of fire at the end of the celebration.\\r\\nIn Sweden the celebration is called Fettisdagen, when you eat fastlagsbulle, more commonly called Semla. The name comes from the words \\"fett\\" (fat) and \\"tisdag\\" (Tuesday). Originally, this was the only day one should eat fastlagsbullar.[14]\\r\\nWhile not observed nationally throughout the United States, a number of traditionally ethnic French cities and regions in the country have notable celebrations. Mardi Gras arrived in North America as a French Catholic tradition with the Le Moyne brothers,[15] Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, in the late 17th century, when King Louis XIV sent the pair to defend France's claim on the territory of Louisiane, which included what are now the U.S. states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and part of eastern Texas.[15]\\r\\nThe expedition, led by Iberville, entered the mouth of the Mississippi River on the evening of March 2, 1699 (new style), Lundi Gras. They did not yet know it was the river explored and claimed for France by Ren-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1683. The party proceeded upstream to a place on the east bank about 60 miles downriver from where New Orleans is today, and made camp. This was on March 3, 1699, Mardi Gras, so in honour of this holiday, Iberville named the spot Point du Mardi Gras (French: \\"Mardi Gras Point\\") and called the nearby tributary Bayou Mardi Gras.[16] Bienville went on to found the settlement of Mobile, Alabama in 1702 as the first capital of French Louisiana.[17] In 1703 French settlers in Mobile established the first organised Mardi Gras celebration tradition in what was to become the United States.[15][18][19][20] The first informal mystic society, or krewe, was formed in Mobile in 1711, the Boeuf Gras Society.[18] By 1720, Biloxi had been made capital of Louisiana. The French Mardi Gras customs had accompanied the colonists who settled there.[15]\\r\\nIn 1723, the capital of Louisiana was moved to New Orleans, founded in 1718.[17] The first Mardi Gras parade held in New Orleans is recorded to have taken place in 1837. The tradition in New Orleans expanded to the point that it became synonymous with the city in popular perception, and embraced by residents of New Orleans beyond those of French or Catholic heritage. Mardi Gras celebrations are part of the basis of the slogan Laissez les bons temps rouler (\\"Let the good times roll\\").[15][not in citation given] On Mardi Gras Day, the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, the last parades of the season wrap up and the celebrations come to a close with the Meeting of the Courts (known locally as the Rex Ball). Other cities along the Gulf Coast with early French colonial heritage, from Pensacola, Florida; Galveston, Texas; to Lake Charles and Lafayette, Louisiana; and north to Natchez, Mississippi, have active Mardi Gras celebrations.\\r\\nGalveston's first recorded Mardi Gras celebration, in 1867, included a masked ball at Turner Hall (Sealy at 21st St.) and a theatrical performance from Shakespeare's \\"King Henry IV\\" featuring Alvan Reed (a justice of the peace weighing in at 350 pounds!) as Falstaff. The first year that Mardi Gras was celebrated on a grand scale in Galveston was 1871 with the emergence of two rival Mardi Gras societies, or \\"Krewes\\" called the Knights of Momus (known only by the initials \\"K.O.M.\\") and the Knights of Myth, both of which devised night parades, masked balls, exquisite costumes and elaborate invitations. The Knights of Momus, led by some prominent Galvestonians, decorated horse-drawn wagons for a torch lit night parade. Boasting such themes as \\"The Crusades,\\" \\"Peter the Great,\\" and \\"Ancient France,\\" the procession through downtown Galveston culminated at Turner Hall with a presentation of tableaux and a grand gala.\\r\\nIn the rural Acadiana area, many Cajuns celebrate with the Courir de Mardi Gras, a tradition that dates to medieval celebrations in France.[21]\\r\\nSt. Louis, Missouri, founded in 1764 by French fur traders, claims to host the second largest Mardi Gras celebration in the United States.[22] The celebration is held in the historic French neighborhood, Soulard, and attracts hundreds of thousands of people from around the country.[23] Although founded in the 1760s, the St. Louis Mardi Gras festivities only date to the 1980s.[24] The city's celebration begins with \\"12th night,\\" held on Epiphany, and ends on Fat Tuesday. The season is peppered with various parades celebrating the city's rich French Catholic heritage.[25]\\r\\n(federal) = federal holidays, (state) = state holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (week) = weeklong holidays, (month) = monthlong holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\\r\\nBold indicates major holidays commonly celebrated in the United States, which often represent the major celebrations of the month.","input":"What is the purpose of celebrating mardi gras?"},{"output":"physiological, biomechanical, and psychological dynamic principles and mechanisms of movement","context":"Kinesiology is the scientific study of human or non-human body movement. Kinesiology addresses physiological, biomechanical, and psychological dynamic principles and mechanisms of movement. Applications of kinesiology to human health (i.e., human kinesiology) include biomechanics and orthopedics; strength and conditioning; sport psychology; methods of rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy; and sport and exercise. Studies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking systems, electrophysiology of muscle and brain activity, various methods for monitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research techniques.[1][2]\\r\\nThe word comes from the Greek ?ҿ? knsis, \\"movement\\" (itself from ? kine?n, \\"to move\\"), and -?ϫ -logia, \\"study\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKinesiology is the study of human and nonhuman animal-body movements, performance, and function by applying the sciences of biomechanics, anatomy, physiology, psychology, and neuroscience. Applications of kinesiology in human-health include physical education teacher, rehabilitation, health and safety, health promotion, workplaces, sport and exercise industries. A bachelor's degree in kinesiology can provide strong preparation for graduate study in biomedical research, as well as in professional programs, such as medicine.\\r\\nWhereas the term \\"kinesiologist\\" is neither a licensed nor professional designation in the United States nor most countries (with the exception of Canada), individuals with training in this area can teach physical education, provide consulting services, conduct research and develop policies related to rehabilitation, human motor performance, ergonomics, and occupational health and safety. In North America, kinesiologists may study to earn a Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, or Doctorate of Philosophy degree in Kinesiology or a Bachelor of Kinesiology degree, while in Australia or New Zealand, they are often conferred an Applied Science (Human Movement) degree (or higher). Many doctoral level faculty in North American kinesiology programs received their doctoral training in related disciplines, such as neuroscience, mechanical engineering, psychology, and physiology.\\r\\nThe world's first kinesiology department was launched in 1967 at the University of Waterloo, Canada.[3]\\r\\nAdaptation through exercise is a key principle of kinesiology that relates to improved fitness in athletes as well as health and wellness in clinical populations. Exercise is a simple and established intervention for many movement disorders and musculoskeletal conditions due to the neuroplasticity of the brain[16] and the adaptability of the musculoskeletal system.[11][12][13] Therapeutic exercise has been shown to improve neuromotor control and motor capabilities in both normal[17] and pathological populations.[5][18]\\r\\nThere are many different types of exercise interventions that can be applied in kinesiology to athletic, normal, and clinical populations. Aerobic exercise interventions help to improve cardiovascular endurance.[19] Anaerobic strength training programs can increase muscular strength,[12] power,[20] and lean body mass.[21] Decreased risk of falls and increased neuromuscular control can be attributed to balance intervention programs.[22] Flexibility programs can increase functional range of motion and reduce the risk of injury.[23]\\r\\nAs a whole, exercise programs can reduce symptoms of depression[24] and risk of cardiovascular[25] and metabolic diseases.[26] Additionally, they can help to improve quality of life,[27] sleeping habits,[24] immune system function,[28] and body composition.[29]\\r\\nThe study of the physiological responses to physical exercise and their therapeutic applications is known as exercise physiology, which is an important area of research within kinesiology.\\r\\nNeuroplasticity is also a key scientific principle used in kinesiology to describe how movement and changes in the brain are related. The human brain adapts and acquires new motor skills based on this principle, which includes both adaptive and maladaptive brain changes.\\r\\nAdaptive plasticity\\r\\nRecent empirical evidence indicates the significant impact of physical activity on brain function; for example, greater amounts of physical activity are associated with enhanced cognitive function in older adults.[41] The effects of physical activity can be distributed throughout the whole brain, such as higher gray matter density and white matter integrity after exercise training,[42][43] and/or on specific brain areas, such as greater activation in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.[44] Neuroplasticity is also the underlying mechanism of skill acquisition. For example, after long-term training, pianists showed greater gray matter density in sensorimotor cortex and white matter integrity in the internal capsule compared to non-musicians.[45][46]\\r\\nMaladaptive plasticity\\r\\nMaladaptive plasticity is defined as neuroplasticity with negative effects or detrimental consequences in behavior.[47][48] Movement abnormalities may occur among individuals with and without brain injuries due to abnormal remodeling in central nervous system.[35][49] Learned non-use is an example commonly seen among patients with brain damage, such as stroke. Patients with stroke learned to suppress paretic limb movement after unsuccessful experience in paretic hand use; this may cause decreased neuronal activation at adjacent areas of the infarcted motor cortex.[50][51]\\r\\nThere are many types of therapies that are designed to overcome maladaptive plasticity in clinic and research, such as constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), body weight support treadmill training (BWSTT) and virtual reality therapy. These interventions are shown to enhance motor function in paretic limbs [52][53][54] and stimulate cortical reorganization[55][56][57] in patients with brain damage.\\r\\nMotor redundancy is a widely used concept in kinesiology and motor control which states that, for any task the human body can perform, there are effectively an unlimited number of ways the nervous system could achieve that task.[58] This redundancy appears at multiple levels in the chain of motor execution:\\r\\nThe concept of motor redundancy is explored in numerous studies,[59][60][61] usually with the goal of describing the relative contribution of a set of motor elements (e.g. muscles) in various human movements, and how these contributions can be predicted from a comprehensive theory. Two distinct (but not incompatible) theories have emerged for how the nervous system coordinates redundant elements: simplification and optimization. In the simplification theory, complex movements and muscle actions are constructed from simpler ones, often known as primitives or synergies, resulting in a simpler system for the brain to control.[62][63] In the optimization theory, motor actions arise from the minimization of a control parameter,[61] such as the energetic cost of movement or errors in movement performance.[64]\\r\\nIn Canada, kinesiology is a professional designation as well as an area of study.[65] In the province of Ontario the scope has been officially defined as, \\"the assessment of human movement and performance and its rehabilitation and management to maintain, rehabilitate or enhance movement and performance\\" [66]\\r\\nKinesiologists work in a variety of roles as health professionals. They work as rehabilitation providers in hospitals, clinics and private settings working with populations needing care for musculoskeletal, cardiac and neurological conditions. They provide rehabilitation to persons injured at work and in vehicular accidents. Kinesiologists also work as functional assessment specialists, exercise therapists, ergonomists, return to work specialists, case managers and medical legal evaluators. They can be found in hospital, long term care, clinic, work, and community settings.[67] Additionally, kinesiology is applied in areas of health and fitness for all levels of athletes, but more often found with training of elite athletes.\\r\\nIn Canada, Kinesiology has been designated a regulated health profession in Ontario.[68] Kinesiology was granted the right to regulate in the province of Ontario in the summer of 2007[69] and similar proposals have been made for other provinces. The College of Kinesiologists of Ontario achieved proclamation on April 1, 2013, at which time the professional title \\"Kinesiologist\\" became protected by law. In Ontario only members of the college may call themselves a Registered Kinesiologist. Individuals who have earned degrees in kinesiology can work in research, the fitness industry, clinical settings, and in industrial environments.[70] They also work in cardiac rehabilitation, health and safety, hospital and long-term care facilities and community health centers just to name a few.\\r\\nRoyal Central Institute of Gymnastics (sv) G.C.I. was founded 1813 in Stockholm, Sweden by Pehr Henrik Ling. It was the first Physiotherapy School in the world, training hundreds of medical gymnasts who spread the Swedish physical therapy around the entire world. In 1887, Sweden was the first country in the world to give a national state licence to physiotherapists/physical therapists.[76]\\r\\nThe Swedish medical gymnast and kinesiologist Carl August Georgii (sv), Professor at the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute GCI in Stockholm, was the one who created and coined the new international word Kinesiology in 1854.[76]\\r\\nThe term Kinesiology is a literal translation to Greek+English from the original Swedish word R?relsel?ra, meaning \\"Movement Science\\". It was the foundation of the Medical Gymnastics, the original Physiotherapy and Physical Therapy, developed during 100 years in Sweden (starting 1813).[76]\\r\\nThe new medical therapy created in Sweden was originally called R?relsel?ra (sv), and later in 1854 translated to the new and invented international word \\"Kinesiology\\". The Kinesiology consisted of nearly 2,000 physical movements and 50 different types of massage therapy techniques. They were all used to affect various dysfunctions and even illnesses, not only in the movement apparatus, but also into the internal physiology of man. Thus, the original classical and Traditional Kinesiology was not only a system of rehabilitation for the body, or biomechanics like in modern Academic Kinesiology, but also a new therapy for relieving and curing diseases, by affecting the autonomic nervous system, organs and glands in the body.,[76][77]\\r\\nIn 1886, the Swedish Medical Gymnast Nils Posse (1862-1895) introduced the term kinesiology in the U.S.[78] Nils Posse was a graduate of the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute in Stockholm, Sweden and founder of the Posse Gymnasium in Boston, MA. He was teaching at Boston Normal School of Gymnastics BNSG.[79] The Special Kinesiology Of Educational Gymnastics was the first book ever written in the world with the word \\"Kinesiology\\" in the title of the book. It was written by Nils Posse and published in Boston, 1894-1895.[80]\\r\\nMotion capture technology has application in measuring human movement, and thus kinesiology.

Completed in 2009, it is the home field of the New York Mets of Major League Baseball. Citi Field was built as a replacement for and adjacent to Shea Stadium, which opened in 1964 next to the site of the 1964 New York World's Fair.\\r\\nCiti Field was designed by Populous (then HOK Sport), and is named after Citigroup, a New York financial services company which purchased the naming rights. The $850 million baseball park was funded with $615 million in public subsidies,[8] including the sale of New York City municipal bonds which are to be repaid by the Mets plus interest. The payments will offset property taxes for the lifetime of the park.[9][10] The Mets are receiving $20 million annually from Citibank in exchange for naming the stadium Citi Field.\\r\\nThe first game at Citi Field was on March 29, 2009, with a college baseball game between St. John's and Georgetown.[11] The Mets played their first two games at the ballpark on April 3 and April 4, 2009 against the Boston Red Sox[12] as charity exhibition games. The first regular season home game was played on April 13, 2009, against the San Diego Padres. Citi Field hosted the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, marking the second time the Mets have hosted the event (the first being in 1964, the inaugural season of Shea Stadium).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1990s, the Mets had been looking to replace Shea Stadium. It had originally been built as a multi-purpose stadium in 1964. While it had been retrofitted as a baseball-only stadium after the NFL's New York Jets left for Giants Stadium after the 1983 season, it was still not optimized for baseball, with seating located farther away from the playing field compared to other major league ballparks.[14] The team unveiled a preliminary model of the ballpark in 1998; it featured a retractable roof and a movable grass field, which would have allowed it to host events including conventions and college basketball. The Mets also considered moving to Mitchel Field or Belmont Park in Nassau County, Long Island; Sunnyside Yard in Queens, or the West Side Yard in Manhattan.[15]\\r\\nIn December 2001, shortly before leaving office, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani announced \\"tentative agreements\\" for both the Mets and New York Yankees to build new stadiums. Of the $1.6 billion sought for the stadiums, city and state taxpayers would pick up half the tab for construction, $800 million, along with $390 million on extra transportation.[16] The plan also said that the teams would be allowed to keep all parking revenues, which state officials had already said they wanted to keep to compensate the state for building new garages for the teams.[17] The teams would keep 96% of ticket revenues and 100% of all other revenues, not pay sales tax or property tax on the stadium, and would get low-cost electricity from New York state.[17] Business officials criticized the plan as giving too much money to successful teams with little reason to move to a different city.[17]\\r\\nMichael Bloomberg, who succeeded Giuliani as mayor, exercised the escape clause in the agreements to back out of both deals, saying that the city could not afford to build new stadiums for the Mets and Yankees. Bloomberg said that unbeknownst to him, Giuliani had inserted a clause in this deal which loosened the teams' leases with the city and would allow the Mets and Yankees to leave the city on 60 days' notice to find a new home elsewhere if the city backed out of the agreement.[16][17] At the time, Bloomberg said that publicly funded stadiums were a poor investment. Under Bloomberg, the New York City government would only offer public financing for infrastructure improvements; the teams would have to pay for the stadiums themselves. Bloomberg called the former mayor's agreements \\"corporate welfare.\\" Giuliani had already been instrumental in the construction of taxpayer-funded minor league baseball facilities MCU Park for the Mets' minor league Brooklyn Cyclones and Richmond County Bank Ballpark for the Staten Island Yankees.\\r\\nThe final plans for what is now Citi Field were created as part of the New York City 2012 Olympic bid. After plans for a West Side Stadium fell through, New York looked for an alternate stadium to host the opening and closing ceremonies and track and field. The Olympic Stadium project on the West Side was estimated to cost $2.2 billion, with $300 million provided by New York City and an additional $300 million from New York State. If New York had won the bid, Citi Field would have been expanded to Olympic events while the Mets would have played at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx for the 2012 season.[18]\\r\\nThe projected cost of the new ballpark and other infrastructure improvements is $610 million, with the Mets picking up $420 million of that amount. The agreement includes a 40-year lease that will keep the Mets in New York until 2049. The Mets own the stadium through a wholly owned subsidiary, Queens Ballpark Company.\\r\\nOn March 18, 2006, the New York Mets unveiled the official model for the new ballpark. By July 2006, initial construction of the new park was underway in the parking lot beyond Shea Stadium's left-field, with a projected finish ahead of Opening Day 2009 in late March.\\r\\nBy April 13, 2008, all of the structure for the Jackie Robinson Rotunda was in place with the arched windows receiving their paneling and glass. By September 2008, most of the Citi Field signage had been installed.[19] By December 1, 2008, all of the seats and the playing field had been installed.[20]\\r\\nDuring the 2010 offseason, the bullpen area in right-center field underwent a complete renovation. When the edifice opened in time for the start of the 2009 MLB season, the Mets' bullpen was in front of the visiting bullpen, leading to an obstructed view of the field from the visiting bullpen, which the San Diego Padres complained about during the Mets' first regular-season home series. The bullpens were turned 90, with pitchers throwing toward the field instead of parallel to it.[21] More Mets team colors, player banners and logos were also added throughout the ballpark, including revamping the \\"Let's Go Mets\\" slogan on the Citi Vision board so that the word \\"Mets\\" appears in its traditional script instead of the same font as the rest of the slogan.[22] Additionally, the height of the home run boundary line directly in front of the Home Run Apple in center field was reduced from 16 feet (4.9?m) to 8 feet (2.4?m) in an attempt to produce more home runs.[23]\\r\\nDuring its first three seasons, the large field dimensions caused Citi Field to play as an extreme \\"pitcher's park\\", and home-runs at the stadium were among the fewest in the Major Leagues. Mets' general manager Sandy Alderson changed Citi Field's dimensions in time for the 2012 MLB season in order to make it more friendly to hitters.[24] Changes include building an 8 feet (2.4?m) wall in front of the high 16 feet (4.9?m) wall in left field that many had dubbed the \\"Great Wall of Flushing\\", removing the nook in the \\"Mo's Zone\\" in right field, and reducing the distance in right center field from 415 feet (126?m) from home plate to 390 feet (120?m). The new walls are colored blue in order to address fan complaints that the old black walls with orange trims did not reflect the colors of the Mets.[25] The Mets have also created a new seating section located in between the old and new left field walls called the Party City Party Deck, renamed the M&M's Sweet Seats in 2016 after change of sponsorship, and can accommodate 102 additional fans.[2]\\r\\nThe center and right-center outfield wall were brought in to 380 feet (120?m) for the 2015 season.[26]\\r\\nCiti Field has a capacity of 41,922. It has over 15,000 fewer seats than Shea Stadium. All the seats in the park are green ÿ in an homage to the Polo Grounds, longtime home of the baseball Giants and the original home of the Mets ÿ as opposed to Shea's orange, blue, red and green assortment.[27] The exterior facade is reminiscent of Ebbets Field (which was long sought by Mets owner Fred Wilpon, a Brooklyn native).\\r\\nCiti Field's interior design is primarily influenced by PNC Park, which was the favorite ballpark of Mets COO Jeff Wilpon. Other influences include Great American Ball Park, Coors Field and Citizens Bank Park. Shea Stadium was the only ballpark in the Major Leagues to feature orange foul poles instead of the standard yellow, a unique characteristic that made its way into Citi Field.[28]\\r\\nCiti Field features an overarching bridge motif in its architecture, as New York City is linked by 2,027 bridges and is reflected in the Mets logo, as the team is the symbolic bridge to the city's past National League teams, the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers.[27] In the outfield section of the ballpark, there is a pedestrian bridge named Shea Bridge which resembles the Hell Gate Bridge.[22]\\r\\nSimilar to Shea Stadium, Citi Field's field dimensions make it a pitcher friendly park. The Coca-Cola Corner, originally known as the Pepsi Porch, hangs over the field in right field, extending far beyond the indentation of the Clubhouse and is inspired by Tiger Stadium's right field porch. The Pepsi sign that sat atop the area (2009-2015) was modeled after the one alongside the East River in Gantry Plaza State Park.[29]\\r\\nIn 2012 The Mets added the Party City Party Deck in left field because they moved the fences in. The Party Deck is very similar to The Royals Pepsi Party Porch.\\r\\nDelta Air Lines signed a multiyear deal on September 15, 2008, to sponsor an exclusive section in Citi Field. The Delta Sky360 Club is a 22,500-square-foot (2,090?m2) restaurant-cafe-bar-lounge complex that also houses 1,600 premium seats behind home plate stretching from dugout to dugout.[30]\\r\\nThe front entrance of Citi Field features a rotunda named after Brooklyn Dodgers legend Jackie Robinson and honors his life and accomplishments. Engraved into the rotunda's 160-foot-diameter (49?m) floor and etched into the archways are words and larger-than-life images that defined Robinson's nine values: Courage, Excellence, Persistence, Justice, Teamwork, Commitment, Citizenship, Determination and Integrity.[28]\\r\\nRobinson's famous quote: \\"A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives\\", is engraved into the upper ring of the rotunda. There is also an 8-foot (2.4?m) sculpture of Robinson's number 42.[27] The formal dedication of the Jackie Robinson Rotunda was held as part of Major League Baseball's official celebration of Jackie Robinson Day on April 15, 2009.[31]\\r\\nAnother tradition from Shea Stadium making an appearance in Citi Field is the Home Run Apple. When a Mets player hits a home run, a giant apple, which has a Mets logo on the front that lights up, rises from its housing in the center field batter's eye. The new apple that has been constructed for Citi Field is more than four times the size of the previous one and was designed by Minneapolis-based engineering firm Uni-Systems.[32] Shea's original apple was located inside Citi Field's bullpen entrance gate for the 2009 season. In 2010, the Shea apple was relocated outside the ballpark at Mets Plaza, in between the Jackie Robinson Rotunda and the entrance to the MetsÿWillets Point subway station.[33]\\r\\nBehind the center field scoreboard is the FanFest area, an expanded family entertainment area that includes a miniature wiffleball field replica of Citi Field called Mr. Met's Kiddie Field, a batting cage, a dunk tank, video game kiosks and other attractions.[34][35]\\r\\nCiti Field offers a wide choice of eateries. Taste of the City is a food court located in the center field section of the ballpark. It features food from restaurateur Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group and includes a variety of stands, including Shake Shack (burgers, fries, shakes), Blue Smoke (barbecue), El Verano Taqueria (Mexican cuisine), Catch of the Day (featuring seafood from chef Dave Pasternack of Esca) and Box Frites (Belgian French fries).[27][36] The World's Fare Market is located on the field level in right field and features sushi from Daruma of Tokyo, sandwiches and pastries from Mama's of Corona, Chinese cuisine from Tai Pan Bakery and Korean food from Caf Hanover.[36][37] Citi Field also offers a choice of fresh fruit at several stands around the stadium.[38] In 2010 Citi Field upgraded the food choices on the Promenade Level behind home plate. Blue Smoke BBQ and Box Frites both open a second location.\\r\\nRestaurants and clubs are also available in every level of the ballpark. The 350-seat Acela Club (now Porsche Grill) located in left field on the Excelsior Level, is the dining highlight of the new park and features a full view of the playing field as well as food from Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant Group, renowned for Nobu and Tribeca Grill.[27] Admission into the high-end luxury Porsche Grill and Delta Sky360 Club, and including the other semi-luxury clubs are exclusive to high-end ticket holders only, and some restaurants enforce that reservations be made. A McFadden's Restaurant and Saloon opened at Citi Field in 2010. It is located directly under the Good Humor FanFest and is open to the public year-round.[39][40]\\r\\nThe Mets Hall of Fame & Museum is located adjacent to the Jackie Robinson Rotunda on the first base side and opened on April 5, 2010. The museum includes plaques honoring the inductees of the New York Mets Hall of Fame, the team's World Series trophies from 1969 and 1986, as well as artifacts on loan from noted collectors, former players and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.[41] The museum boasts several displays including autographed memorabilia, original scouting reports on players such as Darryl Strawberry, and handwritten notes from the team's first manager Casey Stengel. In addition to this the team has installed interactive touchscreens that guide visitors through various aspects of the franchise's 50-year history, and there are television screens and timelines that help weave all the disparate elements into a cohesive narrative.\\r\\nBusiness Insider praised the stadium for its aesthetics and named it one of the top 100 venues in sports, while BaseballParks.com called it \\"perfect\\" and especially lauded the Jackie Robinson Rotunda.[42] Reviewers have also praised the many culinary offerings at Citi Field's concession stands.[43][44][45]\\r\\nDespite the modern amenities, Citi Field has not been without criticism. Most notable have been fan complaints of obstructed views, as well as Mets fans' outrage at overemphasis on the celebration of the Brooklyn Dodgers' legacy over the history of the Mets.[46][47][48] Mets owner Fred Wilpon, a Brooklyn native, had grown up a Brooklyn Dodgers fan and admitted to going overboard; Jeffrey Toobin wrote in The New Yorker,\\r\\nIn response to these criticisms, the team installed photographic imagery of famous players and historic moments in Mets history on the Field and Promenade levels as well as the display of team championship banners on the left-field wall during the 2009 season. They also constructed a Mets Hall of Fame and Museum prior to the 2010 season, located adjacent to the Jackie Robinson Rotunda, and changed the color of the outfield wall from black to Mets blue prior to the 2012 season, which many Mets fans had campaigned for.[50] The team also worked on fixing the obstructed views in the Promenade level.[51]\\r\\nDuring its first three seasons in existence, Citi Field was known to play as a \\"pitcher's park\\", and has been cited as the cause of the decreased offensive production of David Wright and Jason Bay. Wright hit only 10 home runs in 2009 after hitting at least 30 in the previous two seasons,[52] while Bay had the worst offensive production of his career in his first season with the Mets in 2010, only hitting 6 home runs, 47 RBIs, and OBP of just .347, and a slugging percentage of a career low .402.[53] Jeff Francoeur, who played with the Mets during their first two years at Citi Field, criticized the ballpark's dimensions, calling it \\"a damn joke.\\"[54] During the 2011 season, Citi Field allowed 1.33 home runs per game, the third lowest total out of the 16 National League ballparks.[25] The team responded by altering the ballpark dimensions for the 2012 season, creating a more neutral ballpark. Wright's 2012 offensive numbers have improved due to the alterations. \\"It's a huge difference\\", Wright said. \\"It allows you to relax and know you dont have to try to hit the ball a mile to see results. And at the same time, if you do hit the ball well and you see results, instead of a 400-foot flyout, youre 1-for-1 and feeling good about yourself.\\"[55]\\r\\nCiti Field is located in the borough of Queens, adjacent to the neighborhoods of Corona, which lies to its west, and Willets Point and Flushing to the east. Flushing Bay is to the north, and the rest of Flushing MeadowsÿCorona Park is to the south. Because it lies within the Flushing postal zone, and because of its location in Flushing MeadowsÿCorona Park, Citi Field is frequently referred to as being in Flushing proper.\\r\\nCiti Field is accessible via mass transit systems such as the New York City Subway via the IRT Flushing Line (7 <7> ?trains) at the Mets ÿ Willets Point station, and the Long Island Rail Road station on the Port Washington Branch also called Mets ÿ Willets Point. New York Water Taxi operates a free ferry to the stadium from Pier 11/Wall Street and the East 34th Street Ferry Landing before every game.[56] For selected games, SeaStreak provides ferry service between Highlands, New Jersey and the stadium. Both ferry services use the slips at the World's Fair Marina, located approximately 0.25 miles (0.40?km) north of Citi Field. The park is also close to several major thoroughfares, including the Grand Central Parkway, the Whitestone and Van Wyck Expressways, the Long Island Expressway, Roosevelt Avenue, Northern Boulevard and Astoria Boulevard.\\r\\nCiti Field is near to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, where the annual US Open grand-slam tennis tournament is held.\\r\\nSince the construction of Citi Field began, satellite parking lots in Flushing Meadow Park (access from College Point Boulevard) have been opened.\\r\\nBold indicates the winner of each game.\\r\\n2017 Opening Day\\r\\nBold indicates the winner of each game.\\r\\n2017 Home Opener\\r\\nBold indicates the winner of each game.\\r\\nOn November 13, 2006, it was officially announced that the ballpark would be called Citi Field, named for Citigroup Inc. Citigroup will be paying $20 million a year for the naming rights to the park over the next 20 years. This made Citi Field the second major league sports venue in the New York metropolitan area and the first in the city itself to be named for a corporate sponsor. At the time, the Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey's Meadowlands Sports Complex had carried the Continental Airlines name; since then Prudential Center in Newark, MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, Red Bull Arena in Harrison, and Barclays Center in Brooklyn have all opened under corporate sponsorship. The deal includes an option on both sides to extend the contract to 40 years, and is the most expensive sports-stadium naming rights agreement ever, subsequently equaled by MetLife Stadium's $400 million deal.[57]\\r\\nAt the groundbreaking for Citi Field, it was announced that the main entrance, modeled on the one in Brooklyn's old Ebbets Field, would be called the Jackie Robinson Rotunda, possibly due to campaigns to forgo naming rights revenue and name the ballpark after Robinson. The Mets are spending more than $600 million for the new ballpark, which New York City and New York state are also supporting with a total of $165 million for such costs as infrastructure and site preparation. On February 24, 2008, the Mets and Citigroup unveiled the new Citi Field logo.[58]\\r\\nBoth Citigroup[59] and the Mets[60] maintain that the naming rights deal is secure, despite Citigroup's economic troubles. This deal has been criticized in light of the late-2000s financial crisis and the $45 billion of taxpayer funds allocated to Citigroup by the U.S. federal government in two separate rescue packages, prompting New York City Council members Vincent Ignizio and James Oddo to suggest that the new ballpark be called \\"Citi/Taxpayer Field.\\" [61] Radio talk show host Brian Lehrer suggested the name \\"Debits Field\\" which combines baseball history with public outrage over the Citi bailout.[62] Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who serves on the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stated in regards to the Citi Field naming rights deal, \\"This type of spending is indefensible and unacceptable to Citigroup's new partner and largest investor: the American taxpayer.... I strongly urge Citigroup to find a way out of this contract and instead spend that $400 million on retaining its employees and restoring confidence in its operations.\\"[63][64][65] On January 29, 2009, congressmen Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Ted Poe of Texas sent a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy F. Geithner urging him to scrap Citigroup's $400 million naming rights deal. \\"We request that you intervene and demand that Citigroup dissolve the agreement they have with the New York Mets,\\" reads the letter. \\"Absent this outcome, we feel strongly that you should compel Citigroup to return immediately all federal monies received to date, as well as cancel all loan guarantees.\\"[66][67] However, Geithner rejected congressional demands to cancel the naming rights deal.[68]\\r\\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on February 3, 2009, that Citigroup considered breaking the naming rights deal. Citi has stated that no government TARP funds would be used in the sponsorship deal.[69]\\r\\nThe naming rights controversy reemerged when details about owner Fred Wilpon's involvement in Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme came to light when a lawsuit was filed on behalf of victims of Madoff's investment scandal in 2011.[70]\\r\\n* Home run hit in first at bat.\\r\\nBetween 2012 and 2016, the Mets had a post-game concert series entitled \\"Mets Concert Series\\" after selected games. Unlike the concerts where the performance was the sole attraction of the evening, \\"Mets Concert Series\\" events were considered promotional dates, and admission to the concert was included in the price of the game ticket.

The overwhelming majority of Syrians who settled in Canada from the 1880s until the 1960s were of the Christian faith. The so-called Shepard of the lost flock, Saint Raphael Hawaweeny of Brooklyn, New York, came to Montreal in 1896 to help establish a Christian association called the Syrian Benevolent Society and then later on an Orthodox church in Montreal for the newly arrived Syrian faithful.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2015, When Justin Trudeau was elected Prime Minister of Canada, over 40,000 Syrian refugees have been brought into Canada.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leading factor for the immigration of Syrians has been to find better jobs. The early immigrants found themselves engaging in basic commerce, with the term 'peddler' becoming almost synonymous with 'Syrian'.[5] Most of these peddlers were successful, and, with time, and after raising enough capital, some became importers and wholesalers, recruiting newcomers and supplying them with merchandise. Others opened small businesses in urban centres all over the country.[6] Later, these merchants would gravitate towards larger urban locations, where the economy was flourishing. Smaller number of Syrians worked as labourers in factories, miners, or as lumber workers. Also, some became pioneers in the southern prairie regions of western Canada, and worked in farming.[6] These workers settled in communities such as Swift Current, Saskatchewan, and Lac La Biche, Alberta. Few reached the Northwest Territories, the best known being Peter Baker, author of the book An Arctic Arab, and later elected as a member of the legislative assembly of the Northwest Territories. By the 1930s, many towns in the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario, and western Canada had one or more stores run by Syrian immigrants.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen also worked occasionally, in addition to household chores, and usually helped run the family store if they had one, and in the cities they would sell goods from door to door.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nSabah, a 2005 film directed by Ruba Nadda, portrays a Syrian Canadian family in Toronto.","input":"When did the first syrian refugees come to canada?"},{"output":"a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08","context":"A person must be at least be 21 years of age to publicly drink an alcoholic beverage in Texas, with some exceptions[1]\\r\\nTexas is one of ten states (California, Colorado, Maryland, Montana, New York, Texas, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) that allow consumption by minors in specific locations such as the privacy of home or in the presence of consenting and supervising family members.

Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College primarily trained Congregational and Unitarian clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869ÿ1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900.[12] James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.\\r\\nThe university is organized into eleven separate academic unitsten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studywith campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area:[13] its 209-acre (85?ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3 miles (5?km) northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area.[14] Harvard's $34.5 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution.[7]\\r\\nHarvard is a large, highly residential research university.[15] The nominal cost of attendance is high, but the university's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages.[16] It operates several arts, cultural, and scientific museums, alongside the Harvard Library, which is the world's largest academic and private library system, comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes.[17][18][19] Harvard's alumni include eight U.S. presidents, several foreign heads of state, 62 living billionaires, 359 Rhodes Scholars, and 242 Marshall Scholars.[20][21][22] To date, some 130 Nobel laureates, 18 Fields Medalists, and 13 Turing Award winners have been affiliated as students, faculty, or staff.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarvard was established in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1638, it obtained British North America's first known printing press.[25][26] In 1639 it was named Harvard College after deceased clergyman John Harvard an alumnus of the University of Cambridge who had left the school S779 and his scholar's library of some 400 volumes.[27] The charter creating the Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\\r\\nA 1643 publication gave the school's purpose as \\"to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust\\";[28] in its early years trained many Puritan ministers.[29] It offered a classic curriculum on the English university model??many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge??but conformed to the tenets of Puritanism. It was never affiliated with any particular denomination, but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Congregational and Unitarian churches.[30]\\r\\nThe leading Boston divine Increase Mather served as president from 1685 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman, marking a turning of the college from Puritanism and toward intellectual independence.\\r\\nThroughout the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[31]:1ÿ4 When the Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later, in 1804, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected to the chair in 1805, and the liberal Samuel Webber was appointed to the presidency of Harvard two years later, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, Arminian ideas (defined by traditionalists as Unitarian ideas).[31]:4ÿ5[32]:24\\r\\nIn 1846, the natural history lectures of Louis Agassiz were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College. Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' \\"participation in the Divine Nature\\" and the possibility of understanding \\"intellectual existences\\". Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the \\"divine plan\\" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to \\"soar with Plato\\" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norris and, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the \\"official philosophy\\" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.[33]\\r\\nCharles W. Eliot, president 1869ÿ1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions. Derived from William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson, these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling God in each person.[34]\\r\\nDuring the 20th century, Harvard's international reputation grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university's scope. Rapid enrollment growth continued as new graduate schools were begun and the undergraduate College expanded. Radcliffe College, established in 1879 as sister school of Harvard College, became one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900.[12]\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, the student body was predominately \\"old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians\\"a group later called \\"WASPs\\" (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants). In 1923 a proposal by president A. Lawrence Lowell that Jews be limited to 15% of undergraduates was rejected, but Lowell did ban blacks from living in Harvard Yard; Lowell believed that \\"forcing\\" blacks and whites to live together \\"would increase a prejudice that?... is most unfortunate and probably growing.\\" But by the 1970s, Harvard was much more diversified.[36][37][38] [39]\\r\\nJames Bryant Conant (president, 1933ÿ1953) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions. He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting Report, published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century.[40]\\r\\nIn 1945ÿ1960 admissions policies were opened up to bring in students from a more diverse applicant pool. No longer drawing mostly from rich alumni of select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college was now open to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but few blacks, Hispanics or Asians.[41]\\r\\nHarvard graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century, and during World War II, students at Radcliffe College (which since 1879 had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women students) began attending Harvard classes alongside men,[42] The first class of women was admitted to Harvard Medical School in 1945.[43] Since the 1970s Harvard has been responsible for essentially all aspects of admission, instruction, and undergraduate life for women, and Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard in 1999.[44]\\r\\nDrew Gilpin Faust, the Dean at Radcliffe, became the first female president of Harvard in 2007.[45][46]\\r\\nHarvard's 209-acre (85?ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5?km) west-northwest of downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. Harvard Yard itself contains the central administrative offices and main libraries of the university, academic buildings including Sever Hall and University Hall, Memorial Church, and the majority of the freshman dormitories. Sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduates live in twelve residential Houses, nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the Charles River. The other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Quadrangle (commonly referred to as the Quad), which formerly housed Radcliffe College students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard. Each residential house contains rooms for undergraduates, House masters, and resident tutors, as well as a dining hall and library. The facilities were made possible by a gift from Yale University alumnus Edward Harkness.[47]\\r\\nRadcliffe Yard, formerly the center of the campus of Radcliffe College and now home of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard,[48] is adjacent to the Graduate School of Education and the Cambridge Common.\\r\\nBetween 2011 and 2013, Harvard University reported crime statistics for its main Cambridge campus that included 104 forcible sex offenses, 55 robberies, 83 aggravated assaults, 89 burglaries, and 43 cases of motor vehicle theft.[49]\\r\\nHarvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge and Allston, on which it pays property taxes.[50] This includes the Allston Doubletree Hotel, The Inn at Harvard, and the Harvard Square Hotel.[51]\\r\\nThe Harvard Business School and many of the university's athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145?ha) campus in Allston,[52] a Boston neighborhood across the Charles River from the Cambridge campus. The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses. Intending a major expansion, Harvard now owns more land in Allston than it does in Cambridge.[53] A ten-year plan[54] calls for 1.4?million square feet (130,000 square meters) of new construction and 500,000 square feet (50,000 square meters) of renovations, including new and renovated buildings at Harvard Business School; a hotel and conference center; a multipurpose institutional building; renovations to graduate student housing and to Harvard Stadium; new athletic facilities; new laboratories and classrooms for the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences; expansion of the Harvard Education Portal; and a district energy facility.\\r\\nFurther south, the Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and the Harvard School of Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5?ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area about 3.3 miles (5.3?km) south of the Cambridge campus, and the same distance southwest of downtown Boston.[14] The Arnold Arboretum, in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, is also owned and operated by Harvard.\\r\\nHarvard also owns and operates the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, in Washington, D.C.; the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts; the Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts[55] and the Villa I Tatti research center[56] in Florence, Italy. Harvard also operates the Harvard Shanghai Center in China.[57]\\r\\nHarvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University.[58] There are 16,000 staff and faculty,[59] including 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors[60] teaching 7,200 undergraduates and 14,000 graduate students.[61]\\r\\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Harvard Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There are ten other graduate and professional school faculties, in addition to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.[clarification needed]\\r\\nJoint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.\\r\\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world. As of September 2011[update], it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession. It was worth $32 billion in 2011, up from $28 billion in September 2010[62] and $26 billion in 2009. It suffered about 30% loss in 2008ÿ2009.[63][64] In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts.[65] Later reports[66] suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion.[67] One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting[66] of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents.[68] As of 2012[update], Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $159 million for students, and a Pell Grant reserve of $4.093 million available for disbursement.[69]\\r\\nSince the 1970s, several campaigns have sought to divest Harvard's endowment from holdings the campaigns opposed, including investments in apartheid South Africa, the tobacco industry, Sudan during the Darfur genocide, and the fossil fuel industry.[70]\\r\\nDuring the divestment from South Africa movement in the late 1980s, student activists erected a symbolic \\"shantytown\\" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech given by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.[71][72] The Harvard Management Company repeatedly refused to divest, stating that \\"operating expenses must not be subject to financially unrealistic strictures or carping by the unsophisticated or by special interest groups.\\"[73] However, the university did eventually reduce its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.[71][74]\\r\\nUndergraduate admission to Harvard is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation as \\"more selective, lower transfer-in\\".[15] Harvard College accepted 5.2% of applicants for the class of 2021, a record low and the second lowest acceptance rate among all national universities.[75][76] Harvard College ended its early admissions program in 2007 as the program was believed to disadvantage low-income and under-represented minority applicants applying to selective universities, but for the class of 2016, an early action program was reintroduced.[77]\\r\\nHarvard's undergraduate admission policies on preference for children of alumni have been the subject of scrutiny and debate as it has been claimed that it primarily aids Caucasians and the wealthy and seems to conflict with the concept of meritocratic admissions.[78][79] The freshman class entering in the fall of 2017 will be the first to be predominantly (50.8%) nonwhite.[80]\\r\\nHarvard is a large, highly residential research university.[15] The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929.[82] The university offers 46 undergraduate concentrations (majors),[83] 134 graduate degrees,[84] and 32 professional degrees.[85] For the 2008ÿ2009 academic year, Harvard granted 1,664 baccalaureate degrees, 400 master's degrees, 512 doctoral degrees, and 4,460 professional degrees.[85]\\r\\nThe four-year, full-time undergraduate program comprises a minority of enrollments at the university and emphasizes instruction with an \\"arts and sciences focus\\".[15] Between 1978 and 2008, entering students were required to complete a core curriculum of seven classes outside of their concentration.[86] Since 2008, undergraduate students have been required to complete courses in eight General Education categories: Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding, Culture and Belief, Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, Ethical Reasoning, Science of Living Systems, Science of the Physical Universe, Societies of the World, and United States in the World.[87] Harvard offers a comprehensive doctoral graduate program, and there is a high level of coexistence[further explanation needed] between graduate and undergraduate degrees.[15] The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, The New York Times, and some students have criticized Harvard for its reliance on teaching fellows for some aspects of undergraduate education; they consider this to adversely affect the quality of education.[88][89]\\r\\nHarvard's academic programs operate on a semester calendar beginning in early September and ending in mid-May.[90] Undergraduates typically take four half-courses per term and must maintain a four-course rate average to be considered full-time.[91] In many concentrations, students can elect to pursue a basic program or an honors-eligible program requiring a senior thesis and/or advanced course work.[92] Students graduating in the top 4ÿ5% of the class are awarded degrees summa cum laude, students in the next 15% of the class are awarded magna cum laude, and the next 30% of the class are awarded cum laude.[93] Harvard has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa and various committees and departments also award several hundred named prizes annually.[94] Harvard, along with other universities, has been accused of grade inflation,[95] although there is evidence that the quality of the student body and its motivation have also increased.[96] Harvard College reduced the number of students who receive Latin honors from 90% in 2004 to 60% in 2005. Moreover, the honors of \\"John Harvard Scholar\\" and \\"Harvard College Scholar\\" would now be given only to the top 5 percent and the next 5 percent of each class.[97][98][99][100]\\r\\nUniversity policy is to expel students engaging in academic dishonesty to discourage a \\"culture of cheating.\\"[101][102][103] In 2012, dozens of students were expelled for cheating after an investigation of more than 120 students.[104] In 2013, there was a report that as many as 42% of incoming freshmen had cheated on homework prior to entering the university,[105] and these incidents have prompted the university to consider adopting an honor code.[103][106]\\r\\nFor the 2012ÿ2013 school year, annual tuition was $38,000, with a total cost of attendance of $57,000.[107] Beginning in 2007, families with incomes below $60,000 pay nothing for their children to attend, including room and board. Families with incomes between $60,000 to $80,000 pay only a few thousand dollars per year, and families earning between $120,000 and $180,000 pay no more than 10% of their annual incomes.[16] In 2009, Harvard offered grants totaling $414 million across all eleven divisions;[further explanation needed] $340 million came from institutional funds, $35 million from federal support, and $39 million from other outside support. Grants total 88% of Harvard's aid for undergraduate students, with aid also provided by loans (8%) and work-study (4%).[108] Tuition only covers 6.4% of Harvard's operating costs[109]\\r\\nHarvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities[110] and remains a research university with \\"very high\\" research activity and a \\"comprehensive\\" doctoral program across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine.[15] Research and development expenditures in 2011 totaled $649.7 million, 27th among American universities.[111]\\r\\nThe Harvard University Library System is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding over 18 million volumes.[17][18] According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the United States, and one of the largest in the world.[18] Cabot Science Library, Lamont Library, and Widener Library are three of the most popular libraries for undergraduates to use, with easy access and central locations. There are rare books, manuscripts and other special collections throughout Harvard's libraries;[112] Houghton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library.\\r\\nHarvard operates several arts, cultural, and scientific museums. The Harvard Art Museums comprise three museums. The Arthur M. Sackler Museum includes collections of ancient, Asian, Islamic and later Indian art, the Busch-Reisinger Museum, formerly the Germanic Museum, covers central and northern European art, and the Fogg Museum of Art, covers Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance, British pre-Raphaelite, and 19th-century French art. The Harvard Museum of Natural History includes the Harvard Mineralogical Museum, Harvard University Herbaria featuring the Blaschka Glass Flowers exhibit, and the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Other museums include the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, designed by Le Corbusier, housing the film archive, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, specializing in the cultural history and civilizations of the Western Hemisphere, and the Semitic Museum featuring artifacts from excavations in the Middle East.\\r\\nAmong overall rankings, the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) has ranked Harvard as the world's best university every year since it was first released.[123] When QS and Times Higher Education were published in partnership as the THE-QS World University Rankings during 2004ÿ2009, Harvard had also held the top spot every year.[124] Additionally, the THE World Reputation Rankings have consecutively ranked Harvard as the top institution among the world's \\"six super brand\\" universities, the others being Berkeley, Cambridge, MIT, Oxford and Stanford.[125][126]\\r\\nRegarding rankings of specific indicators, Harvard topped both University Ranking by Academic Performance 2015ÿ2016 and Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities (2011), which measured universities' numbers of alumni holding CEO positions in Fortune Global 500 companies.[127] According to the 2016 poll done by The Princeton Review, Harvard is the second most commonly named \\"dream college\\" in the United States, both for students and parents.[128] College ROI Report: Best Value Colleges by PayScale puts Harvard 22nd nationwide in the most recent 2016 edition.[129]\\r\\nIn the last six years, Harvard's student population ranged from 19,000 to 21,000, across all programs.[133] Harvard enrolled 6,655 students in undergraduate programs, 3,738 students in graduate programs, and 10,722 students in professional programs.[130] The undergraduate population is 51% female, the graduate population is 48% female, and the professional population is 49% female.[130]\\r\\nThe Harvard Crimson competes in 42 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I Ivy League. Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University culminating in The Game, although the HarvardÿYale Regatta predates the football game. This rivalry is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.[134]\\r\\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply \\"The Game\\". While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.[135][136]\\r\\nHarvard has several athletic facilities, such as the Lavietes Pavilion, a multi-purpose arena and home to the Harvard basketball teams. The Malkin Athletic Center, known as the \\"MAC\\", serves both as the university's primary recreation facility and as a satellite location for several varsity sports. The five-story building includes two cardio rooms, an Olympic-size swimming pool, a smaller pool for aquaerobics and other activities, a mezzanine, where all types of classes are held, an indoor cycling studio, three weight rooms, and a three-court gym floor to play basketball. The MAC offers personal trainers and specialty classes. It is home to Harvard volleyball, fencing and wrestling.\\r\\nWeld Boathouse and Newell Boathouse house the women's and men's rowing teams, respectively. The men's crew also uses the Red Top complex in Ledyard, Connecticut, as their training camp for the annual Harvard-Yale Regatta. The Bright Hockey Center hosts the Harvard hockey teams, and the Murr Center serves both as a home for Harvard's squash and tennis teams as well as a strength and conditioning center for all athletic sports.\\r\\nAs of 2013[update], there were 42 Division I intercollegiate varsity sports teams for women and men at Harvard, more than at any other NCAA Division I college in the country.[137] As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.[138]\\r\\nOlder than The Game by 23 years, the Harvard-Yale Regatta was the original source of the athletic rivalry between the two schools. It is held annually in June on the Thames River in eastern Connecticut. The Harvard crew is typically considered to be one of the top teams in the country in rowing. Today, Harvard fields top teams in several other sports, such as the Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey team (with a strong rivalry against Cornell), squash, and even recently won NCAA titles in Men's and Women's Fencing. Harvard also won the Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships in 2003.\\r\\nHarvard's men's ice hockey team won the school's first NCAA Championship in any team sport in 1989. Harvard was also the first Ivy League institution to win a NCAA championship title in a women's sport when its women's lacrosse team won the NCAA Championship in 1990.\\r\\nHarvard Undergraduate Television has footage from historical games and athletic events including the 2005 pep-rally before the Harvard-Yale Game.\\r\\nThe school color is crimson, which is also the name of the Harvard sports teams and the daily newspaper, The Harvard Crimson. The color was unofficially adopted (in preference to magenta) by an 1875 vote of the student body, although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858, when Charles William Eliot, a young graduate student who would later become Harvard's 21st and longest-serving president (1869ÿ1909), bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta.\\r\\nHarvard has several fight songs, the most played of which, especially at football, are \\"Ten Thousand Men of Harvard\\" and \\"Harvardiana.\\" While \\"Fair Harvard\\" is actually the alma mater, \\"Ten Thousand Men\\" is better known outside the university. The Harvard University Band performs these fight songs, and other cheers at football and hockey games.

Furthermore, the perception of Harvard as a center of either elite achievement, or elitist privilege, has made it a frequent literary and cinematic backdrop. \\"In the grammar of film, Harvard has come to mean both tradition, and a certain amount of stuffiness,\\" film critic Paul Sherman has said.[139]\\r\\nHarvard's policy since 1970 has been to permit filming on its property only rarely, so most scenes set at Harvard (especially indoor shots, but excepting aerial footage and shots of public areas such as Harvard Square) are in fact shot elsewhere.[145][146]\\r\\nCoordinates: 422228N 710701W? / ?42.37444N 71.11694W? / 42.37444; -71.11694","input":"When was harvard university founded and where is it located?"},{"output":"the late 19th century","context":"A hollow-point bullet is an expanding bullet that has a pit or hollowed out shape in its tip often intended to cause the bullet to expand upon entering a target in order to decrease penetration and disrupt more tissue as it travels through the target. It is also used for controlled penetration, where over-penetration could cause collateral damage (such as aboard an aircraft). In target shooting, they are used for greater accuracy and reduction of smoke, fouling, and lead vapor exposure, as hollow point bullets have an enclosed base while traditional bullets have an exposed lead base.\\r\\nHollow points are designed to increase in diameter once within the target, thus maximizing tissue damage and blood loss or shock, and to remain inside the target, thereby transferring all of the kinetic energy to the target (whereas some fraction would remain in the bullet if it passed through instead). Both of these goals are meant to maximize stopping power. Jacketed hollow points (JHPs) or plated hollow points are covered in a coating of harder metal (usually a copper alloy or copper coated steel) to increase bullet strength and to prevent fouling the barrel with lead stripped from the bullet. The term hollow-cavity bullet is used to describe a hollow point where the hollow is unusually large, sometimes dominating the volume of the bullet, and causes extreme expansion or fragmentation on impact.[1]\\r\\nPlastic-tipped bullets are a type of (rifle) bullet meant to confer the aerodynamic advantage of the spitzer bullet (for example, see very-low-drag bullet) and the stopping power of hollow point bullets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a hollow-point hunting bullet strikes a soft target, the pressure created in the pit forces the material (usually lead) around the inside edge to expand outwards, increasing the axial diameter of the projectile as it passes through. This process is commonly referred to as mushrooming, because the resulting shape, a widened, rounded nose on top of a cylindrical base, typically resembles a mushroom.\\r\\nThe greater frontal surface area of the expanded bullet limits its depth of penetration into the target, and causes more extensive tissue damage along the wound path. Many hollow-point bullets, especially those intended for use at high velocity in centerfire rifles, are jacketed, i.e. a portion of the lead-cored bullet is wrapped in a thin layer of harder metal, such as copper, brass, or mild steel. This jacket provides additional strength to the bullet, increases penetration, and can help prevent it from leaving deposits of lead inside the bore. In controlled expansion bullets, the jacket and other internal design characteristics help to prevent the bullet from breaking apart; a fragmented bullet will not penetrate as far.\\r\\nFor bullets designed for target shooting, some such as the Sierra \\"Matchking\\" incorporate a cavity in the nose, called the meplat. This allows the manufacturer to maintain a greater consistency in tip shape and thus aerodynamic properties among bullets of the same design, at the expense of a slightly decreased ballistic coefficient and higher drag. The result is a slightly decreased overall accuracy between bullet trajectory and barrel direction, as well as an increased susceptibility to wind drift, but closer grouping of subsequent shots due to bullet consistency, often increasing the shooter's perceived accuracy.\\r\\nThe manufacturing process of hollow-point bullets also produces a flat, uniformly-shaped base on the bullet which allegedly increases accuracy by providing a more consistent piston surface for the expanding gases of the cartridge.\\r\\nMatch or target hollow-point bullets are designed for precision target use, and no consideration is given to their expansion or other terminal ballistic performance. The United States military claims to use hollow-point bullets in some sniper rifles for their exceptional accuracy at long ranges, and claim that the hollow-point does not result in wounds significantly different from full metal jacket ammunition in practice.[2]\\r\\nA hollow-point boat-tail bullet is a match-grade bullet design that uses the concept of a teardrop-shaped tail to give it a lower drag coefficient and make it produce less turbulence in its wake. Only the base of the bullet has a boat tail-like shape ÿ the meplat is still pointed. Some hollow-point boat-tail bullets with longer, more aerodynamic profiles are known as very-low-drag bullets.\\r\\nTerminal ballistics testing of hollow point bullets is generally performed in ballistic gelatin, or some other medium intended to simulate tissue and cause a hollow point bullet to expand. Test results are generally given in terms of expanded diameter, penetration depth, and weight retention. Expanded diameter is an indication of the size of the wound cavity, penetration depth shows if vital organs could be reached by the bullet, and weight retention indicates how much of the bullet mass fragmented and separated from the main body of the bullet. How these factors are interpreted depends on the intended use of the bullet, and there are no universally agreed-upon ideal metrics.\\r\\nSolid lead bullets, when cast from a soft alloy, will often deform and provide some expansion if they hit the target at a high velocity. This, combined with the limited velocity and penetration attainable with muzzleloading firearms, meant there was little need for extra expansion.\\r\\nThe first hollow-point bullets were marketed in the late 19th century as express bullets, and were hollowed out to reduce the bullet's mass and provide higher velocities. In addition to providing increased velocities, the hollow also turned out to provide significant expansion, especially when the bullets were cast in a soft lead alloy. Originally intended for rifles, the popular .32-20, .38-40, and .44-40 calibers could also be fired in revolvers.\\r\\nWith the advent of smokeless powder, velocities increased, and bullets got smaller, faster, and lighter. These new bullets (especially in rifles) needed to be jacketed to handle the conditions of firing. The new full metal jacket bullets tended to penetrate straight through a target and produce little damage. This led to the development of the soft point bullet and later jacketed hollow-point bullets at the British arsenal in Dum Dum, near Calcutta around 1890. Designs included the .303\\" Mk III, IV & V and the .455\\" Mk III \\"Manstopper\\" cartridges. Although such bullet designs were quickly outlawed for use in warfare (in 1898, the Germans complained they breached the Laws of War), they steadily gained ground among hunters due to the ability to control the expansion of the new high velocity cartridges. In modern ammunition, the use of hollow points is primarily limited to handgun ammunition, which tends to operate at much lower velocities than rifle ammunition (on the order of 1,000 feet per second (300?m/s) versus over 2,000 feet per second). At rifle velocities, a hollow point is not needed for reliable expansion and most rifle ammunition makes use of tapered jacket designs to achieve the mushrooming effect. At the lower handgun velocities, hollow point designs are generally the only design which will expand reliably.\\r\\nModern hollowpoint bullet designs use many different methods to provide controlled expansion, including:\\r\\n9G19mm Parabellum hollow point.\\r\\n.45 ACP Federal HST 230gr hollow point cartridge, with two rounds of CCI Standard Velocity .22 LR for comparison purposes.\\r\\n.40 S&W round, complete cartridge and expanded bullet.\\r\\nA 9mm hollow point cartridge, along with unexpanded and expanded bullets; expanded lead bullet and copper jacket are separated.\\r\\nThe Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibited the use in international warfare of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body.[3] This is often incorrectly believed to be prohibited in the Geneva Conventions, but it significantly predates those conventions, and is in fact a continuance of the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868, which banned exploding projectiles of less than 400?grams, as well as weapons designed to aggravate injured soldiers or make their death inevitable. NATO members do not use small arms ammunition that are prohibited by the Hague Convention and the United Nations.[citation needed]\\r\\nDespite the ban on military use, hollow-point bullets are one of the most common types of bullets used by civilians and police,[4] which is due largely to the reduced risk of bystanders being hit by over-penetrating or ricocheted bullets, and the increased speed of incapacitation.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn many jurisdictions, even ones such as the United Kingdom, where expanding ammunition is generally prohibited, it is illegal to hunt certain types of game with ammunition that does not expand.[5][6]\\r\\nAll expanding ammunition, including hollow point bullets, falls under Section 5 (prohibited weapons) of the Firearms Act 1968 and so is illegal to possess or transfer without the written permission of the Home Secretary. The law is in conflict with 'Schedule 2' of 'The Deer Act 1991', prohibiting the use of any ammunition other than soft-nosed or hollow-point bullets for the killing of deer. Because of this conflict, Section 5A(4) allows the police licensing authority to add a condition to a firearm certificate for possession of expanding ammunition for:[5][7]\\r\\nThe United States is one of few major powers that did not agree to IV,3 of the Hague Convention of 1899, and thus is able to use this kind of ammunition in warfare, but the United States ratified the second (1907) Hague Convention IV-23, which says \\"To employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering\\", similar to IV-3 of the first Convention. For years the United States military respected this Convention and refrained from the use of expanding ammunition, and even made special FMJ .22LR ammunition for use in High Standard pistols that were issued to the OSS agents. The US Army has mentioned that it has been considering using the ammunition for side arms, with a possible start date of 2018.[8]\\r\\nThe state of New Jersey bans possession of hollow point bullets by civilians, except for ammunition possessed at one's own dwellings, premises, or other lands owned or possessed, or for, while and traveling to and from hunting with a hunting license if otherwise legal for the particular game. The law also requires all hollow point ammunition to be transported directly from the place of purchase to one's home or premises, or hunting area, or by members of a rifle or pistol club directly to a place of target practice, or directly to an authorized target range from the place of purchase or one's home or premises.[9]\\r\\nIn early 1992, Winchester introduced the \\"Black Talon\\", a newly designed hollow-point handgun bullet which used a specially designed, reverse tapered jacket. The jacket was cut at the hollow to intentionally weaken it, and these cuts allowed the jacket to open into six petals upon impact. The thick jacket material kept the tips of the jacket from bending as easily as a normal thickness jacket. The slits that weakened the jacket left triangular shapes in the tip of the jacket, and these triangular sections of jacket would end up pointing out after expansion, leading to the \\"Talon\\" name. The bullets were coated with a black colored, paint-like lubricant called \\"Lubalox,\\" and loaded into nickel-plated brass cases, which made them visually stand out from other ammunition. While actual performance of the Black Talon rounds was not significantly better than any other comparable high performance hollow-point ammunition, the reverse taper jacket did provide reliable expansion under a wide range of conditions, and many police departments adopted the round.[10]\\r\\nWinchester's \\"Black Talon\\" product name was eventually used against them. After a high-profile mass shooting at a large law firm at 101 California Street, San Francisco in 1993, media response against Winchester was swift. \\"This bullet kills you better\\", says one report; \\"its six razorlike claws unfold on impact, expanding to nearly three times the bullet's diameter\\".[11][12] A concern was raised by the American College of Emergency Physicians that the sharp edges of the jacket could penetrate surgical gloves, increasing the risk of blood-borne infections being transmitted to medical personnel treating the gunshot wound. While plausible, there are no recorded cases of such an infection occurring in relation to the Black Talon bullets.[13]\\r\\nWinchester responded to the media criticism of the Black Talon line by removing it from the commercial market and only selling it to law enforcement distributors. Winchester has since discontinued the sale of the Black Talon entirely, although Winchester does manufacture very similar ammunition, the Ranger T-Series and the Supreme Elite Bonded PDX1.[14][15]\\r\\nThe hollow point and soft-nosed bullets are both sometimes also referred to as dum-dums, so named after the British arsenal at Dum Dum, in present north Kolkata, India, where it is said jacketed, expanding bullets were first developed.[16][17] This term is rare among shooters in North America, but can still be found in use, usually in the news media and sensational popular fiction,[18] as well as in video games (such as Crimson Skies).[19] Recreational shooters sometimes refer to hollow points as \\"JHPs\\", from the common manufacturer's abbreviation for \\"jacketed hollow point\\".","input":"When was the first hollow point bullet made?"},{"output":"September 28, 2017","context":"The fourteenth season of the American television medical drama Grey's Anatomy was ordered on February 10, 2017, by American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and premiered on September 28, 2017 with a special two-hour premiere.[1] The season will consist of 24 episodes,[2][3] with the season's seventh episode marking the 300th episode for the series overall.

Joshua Johnson was originally from Maryland. Louisa had six sisters: Ann, Caroline, Harriet, Catherine, Elizabeth, and Adelaide, and a brother, Thomas. She grew up in London and Nantes, France, where the family took refuge during the American Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe met John Quincy Adams at her father's house in Cooper's Row, near Tower Hill, London. Her father had been appointed as United States consul general in 1790, and Adams first visited him in November 1795. Adams at first showed interest in her older sister but soon settled on Louisa. Adams, aged 30, married Louisa, aged 22, on July 26, 1797, at the parish church of All Hallows-by-the-Tower, on Tower Hill. Adams' father, John Adams, then President of the United States eventually welcomed his daughter-in-law into the family, although they did not meet for several years.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHer parents left Europe in 1797 and went to the U.S. When her father was forced into bankruptcy, President John Adams appointed him as U.S. Director of Stamps. Her father died in Frederick, Maryland, in 1802 of severe fever and some mental problems, leaving little provision for his family. Her mother died in September 1811, in her mid-fifties,[2] and is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Quincy Adams and Louisa Adams had the following children:\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa was sickly, plagued by migraine headaches and frequent fainting spells. She had several miscarriages over the course of her marriage. Having grown up in London and France,  she found Massachusetts dull and provincial, and referred to the Adams family home as being  \\"like  something out of Noah's Ark\\". On the other hand she developed a warm affection for her father-in-law, and despite occasional differences, a deep respect for her mother-in-law Abigail Adams,  whom she later described as \\"the guiding planet round which we all revolved\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left her two older sons in Massachusetts for education in 1809 when she took two-year-old Charles Francis Adams to Russia, where Adams served as a Minister. Despite the glamour of the tsar's court, she had to struggle with cold winters, strange customs, limited funds, and poor health. An infant daughter born in 1811 died the next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeace negotiations called Adams to Ghent in 1814 and then to London. To join him, she made a forty-day journey across war-ravaged Europe by coach in winter. Roving bands of stragglers and highwaymen filled her with \\"unspeakable terrors\\" for her son. The next two years gave her an interlude of family life in the country of her birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen John Quincy Adams was appointed James Monroe's Secretary of State in 1817, the family moved to Washington, D.C. where Louisa's drawing room became a center for the diplomatic corps and other notables. Music enhanced her Tuesday evenings at home, and theater parties contributed to her reputation as an outstanding hostess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pleasures of moving into the White House in 1825 were dimmed by the bitter politics of the election, paired with her deep depression. Though she continued her weekly \\"drawing rooms\\", she preferred quiet evenings of reading, composing music and verse, and playing her harp. As First Lady, she became reclusive and depressed. For a time, she regretted ever having married into the Adams family, the men of which she found cold and insensitive. The necessary entertainments were always elegant and her cordial hospitality made the last official reception a gracious occasion although her husband had lost his bid for re-election and partisan feeling still ran high.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his diary for June 23, 1828, her husband recorded her \\"winding silk from several hundred silkworms that she has been rearing,\\" evidently in the White House.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought she was retiring to Massachusetts permanently, but in 1831 her husband began seventeen years of service in the United States House of Representatives.

Although they are sometimes referred to as regional languages, there is no uniformity within any Italian region, and speakers from one locale within a region are typically aware of the features distinguishing their local tongue from the one of other places nearby. The official and most widely spoken language across the country is Italian, a direct descendant of Tuscan.\\r\\nAlmost all the Romance languages native to Italy, with the notable exception of Italian, are often colloquially referred to as \\"dialects\\", although for some of them the term may coexist with other labels like \\"minority languages\\" or \\"vernaculars\\".[7] However, the use of the term \\"dialect\\" to refer to the languages of Italy erroneously implies that the languages spoken in Italy are actual \\"dialects\\" of Standard Italian in the prevailing linguistic sense of \\"varieties or variations of a language.\\"[citation needed] This is generally not the case in regard to the languages of Italy, as they are, for the most part, not varieties of Standard Italian. Most of the regional languages of Italy predate Standard Italian and evolved locally from Vulgar Latin and independently of what would become Standard Italian, long before the fairly recent spread of Standard Italian throughout Italy.[8] In fact, Standard Italian is itself either a continuation of, or a dialect heavily based on, Florentine Tuscan. The indigenous local Romance tongues of Italy are therefore better classified as separate languages that evolved independently from Latin, rather than \\"dialects\\" or variations of the Standard Italian language.[9][10] Conversely, with the spread of Standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, local varieties of Standard Italian influenced to varying extents by the underlying local languages, most noticeably at the phonological level, have also developed throughout the peninsula; though regional boundaries seldom correspond to isoglosses distinguishing these varieties, they are commonly referred to as Regional Italian (italiano regionale).\\r\\nThere are several minority languages that belong to other Indo-European branches, such as Cimbrian (Germanic), Arb?resh (Albanian), the Slavomolisano dialect of Serbo-Croatian (Slavic), and Griko (Hellenic). Other non-indigenous languages are spoken by a substantial percentage of the population due to immigration.[11][not in citation given]\\r\\nItaly is a signatory of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, but is yet to ratify the treaty, and therefore its provisions protecting regional languages do not apply in the country.[12]\\r\\nThe Charter does not, however, establish at what point differences in expression result in a separate language, deeming it an \\"often controversial issue\\", and citing the necessity to take into account, other than purely linguistic criteria, also \\"psychological, sociological and political considerations\\".[13]\\r\\nThe following minority languages are officially recognized as \\"historical language minorities\\" by the Law no. 482/1999: Albanian, Catalan, German, Greek, Slovene, Croatian, French, Franco-Proven?al, Friulian, Ladin, Occitan and Sardinian (Legge 15 Dicembre 1999, n. 482, Art. 2, comma 1).[14] The selection of those varieties to the exclusion of numerous others is a matter of some controversy.[15] Some interpretations of said law also make a distinction between those who are considered national minorities (Albanians, Catalans, Germanic peoples indigenous to Italy, Greeks, Slovenes and Croats)[16] and those who are not (all the others).[14]\\r\\nThe original Italian Constitution does not explicitly express that Italian is the official national language.

Ethnologue, not without controversy, even goes as far as considering Sardinian to be four separate languages, all being included along with Corsican and the Corso-Sardinian varieties in a hypothetical subgroup (Southern Romance[35]) which has gained little support from linguists. UNESCO, while seeming to share the same opinion of Ethnologue by calling Gallurese and Sassarese alternately \\"Sardinian\\",[30] considers them to be dialects of Corsican rather than Sardinian on the other hand.[30] As is not infrequently the case in such controversies, the linguistic landscape of Sardinia is in principle most accurately described as being, for the most part, a dialect continuum.\\r\\nThe Northern Italian languages are conventionally defined as those Romance languages spoken north of the La SpeziaÿRimini Line, which runs through the northern Apennine Mountains just to the north of Tuscany; however, the dialects of Occitan and Franco-Proven?al spoken in the extreme northwest of Italy (e.g. the Vald?tain in the Aosta Valley) are generally excluded.

Its name could be taken to mean \\"headland of the small huts\\", which can be attributed to the indigenous buildings that existed along the coast. The emirate is in the northern part of the UAE, bordering Oman's exclave of Musandam. It covers an area of 1,684?km2 (650?sq?mi). The capital city and home of most residents is also called Ras Al Khaimah. The emirate had a population of 210,063 at the 2005 Census, of which 41.82 percent or 87,848 were Emirati citizens. Latest estimates put the total population at between 250,000 and 300,000.

It consists of a northern part (where the city of Ras al-Khaimah is situated), and a large inland exclave in the south (near Hatta), and a few small islands in the Persian Gulf.[2] Ras al-Khaimah has the most fertile soil in the country, due to a larger share in rainfall and underground water streams from Omani mountains.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRas al-Khaimah has been the site of human habitation for several millennia and there are many historical and archaeological sites throughout the emirate - local sources cite 1,000[4] - dating from different time periods, including remnants of the Umm an-Nar Culture (3rd millennium BC).[5] Ancient graves were found in the Emirate in October 2012.[6]\\r\\nThe city was historically known as Julfar.\\r\\nAccording to Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi, current ruler of Sharjah Emirate, the city of Ras al-Khaimah (which before was the capital of the state that is now Sharjah) was historically known as Julfar and was founded by Armenians who escaped Persia during the Mongol invasion.[citation needed]\\r\\nFurther, archaeological evidence has demonstrated that the settlement known as Julfar shifted location over time as harbour channels silted up. Excavations of a sizable tell, which revealed remnants of a Sassanid era fortification, indicate that early Julfar was located in the north of Ras Al-Khaimah, not far from other sites of historical/archaeological interest such as 'Sheba's Palace' and the largest Umm an-Nar tombs found on the Arabian Peninsula. Sources say that Julfar was inhabited by the Azd (a branch of the Kahlan tribe) during the eighth and ninth centuries AD, and that the houses of the Azd were built of wood.\\r\\nThere is considerable debate locally regarding the 18th-century charge of maritime piracy, attracting the British label 'The Pirate Coast' to the Eastern Gulf before a series of treaties in 1820, 1853 and, in 1892, the Perpetual Maritime Truce led to it being known as the 'Trucial Coast'.\\r\\nIn the early 18th century, the Al Qasimi dynasty established itself in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah on the Arabian Peninsula, growing to become a significant maritime force with holdings on both the Persian and Arabian coasts. In 1819, a British naval force was sent from Bombay in order to suppress alleged piracy - actions of the Al Qasimi fleet against British flagged shipping that affected trade routes in the Strait of Hormuz, along the Persian Gulf coast, and the Indian Ocean.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the Battle of Ras Al Khaimah of 1809, the Al Qasimi fleet was largely destroyed. The British operation continued to Linga on the Persian coast which was, like the Greater and Lesser Tunbs islands, administered by the Al Qasimi. The attack on Ras Al Khaimah resulted in the destruction of the tower of the 16th century Dhayah Fort whose remains can be seen at Rams in northern Ras Al Khaimah. In January 1820, the British imposed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 signed by Sheikh Sultan Bin Saqr Al Qasimi who was reinstated by the British in Ras Al Khaimah after the deposition of Hasan Bin Rahma.[7] The treaty stipulated the end of piracy and slavery, and laid the foundation for the British protectorate over the Trucial States that lasted until 1971.

Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday-Saturday, as a compromise between Friday's holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday-Sunday.[16] It should be noted however that a great majority of the population are non national citizens, coming from India, Pakistan, and a wide range of nations.\\r\\nThe majority of mosques are Hanbali, Muwahhid Muslim or Salafi\\r\\nThe annual Ras al-Khaimah Half Marathon, first held in 2007, has called the attention of the world's sporting media to the region. The organisers invest much in the IAAF-labeled race in order to attract the world's top athletes, resulting in a world record from Samuel Wanjiru in 2007 and the second fastest run of all-time from Patrick Makau Musyoki in 2009.[17]\\r\\nUAE Awafi Festival?ÿ a yearly festival in the Ras al-Khaimah desert, focusing mainly on the Arabic public[clarification needed]. It is a three-week event, held in December or January, the main attraction being a dramatic sand dune race by the strongest 4-wheel drivers of the UAE. There is a heritage village with traditional food and dance, as well as shops for food and souvenirs. There is also a petting zoo and lots of games for children. The entry is free of charge, and many families bring picnics to enjoy whilst watching the cars battling it out over the sand dunes.\\r\\nTerry Fox Run RAK?ÿ a yearly charity run organized in Ras al-Khaimah to support cancer research in the UAE.[18] The first event was organized in 2010 (short movie from 1st RAKTFR event).

The highway allows journeys from Ras al-Khaimah to Dubai in under 45 minutes. The highway is being extended further till Saqr Port to allow direct flow of traffic from the southern emirates, the extension was scheduled to be completed by 2014. In spring 2013 work on the 32-kilometre (20?mi) RAK Ring Road which will bypass the city and connect the quarries and factories of the north coast with the 311 motorway was held up by a three-month rescue excavation after the discovery of megalithic tombs dating to the Wadi Suq period, from 2000 to 1600 BC.[20]\\r\\nSaqr Port, located in the industrial area of Khawr Khuwayr, is the emirate's main port, providing bulk and container services.

It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.\\r\\nBased on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.\\r\\nThere are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest chamber is cut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was built and was unfinished. The so-called[1] Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber are higher up within the pyramid structure. The main part of the Giza complex is a setting of buildings that included two mortuary temples in honour of Khufu (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile), three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even smaller \\"satellite\\" pyramid, a raised causeway connecting the two temples, and small mastaba tombs surrounding the pyramid for nobles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is believed by Egyptologists that the pyramid was built as a tomb for Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenicised as \\"Cheops\\") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon), is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid.[2] It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6?ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4?ft). Each base side was 440?cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9?ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9?million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000?cu?ft).[3]\\r\\nBased on these estimates, building the pyramid in 20 years would involve installing approximately 800 tonnes of stone every day. Additionally, since it consists of an estimated 2.3?million blocks, completing the building in 20 years would involve moving an average of more than 12 of the blocks into place each hour, day and night. The first precision measurements of the pyramid were made by Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie in 1880ÿ82 and published as The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh.[4] Almost all reports are based on his measurements. Many of the casing stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid fit together with extremely high precision. Based on measurements taken on the northeastern casing stones, the mean opening of the joints is only 0.5 millimetre wide (1/50 of an inch).[5]\\r\\nThe pyramid remained the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years,[6] unsurpassed until the 160-metre-tall (520?ft) spire of Lincoln Cathedral was completed c.?1300. The accuracy of the pyramid's workmanship is such that the four sides of the base have an average error of only 58?millimetres in length.[7] The base is horizontal and flat to within I15?mm (0.6?in).[8] The sides of the square base are closely aligned to the four cardinal compass points (within four?minutes of arc)[9] based on true north, not magnetic north,[10] and the finished base was squared to a mean corner error of only 12 seconds of arc.[11]\\r\\nThe completed design dimensions, as suggested by Petrie's survey and subsequent studies, are estimated to have originally been 280 royal cubits high by 440 cubits long at each of the four sides of its base. The ratio of the perimeter to height of 1760/280 royal cubits equates to 2 to an accuracy of better than 0.05% (corresponding to the well-known approximation of  as 22/7). Some Egyptologists consider this to have been the result of deliberate design proportion. Verner wrote, \\"We can conclude that although the ancient Egyptians could not precisely define the value of , in practice they used it\\".[12] Petrie, author of Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh concluded: \\"but these relations of areas and of circular ratio are so systematic that we should grant that they were in the builder's design\\".[13] Others have argued that the Ancient Egyptians had no concept of pi and would not have thought to encode it in their monuments. They believe that the observed pyramid slope may be based on a simple seked slope choice alone, with no regard to the overall size and proportions of the finished building.[14] In 2013, rolls of papyrus called the Diary of Merer were discovered written by some of those who delivered limestone and other construction materials from Tora to Giza.[15]\\r\\nThe Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3?million blocks which most believe to have been transported from nearby quarries. The Tura limestone used for the casing was quarried across the river. The largest granite stones in the pyramid, found in the \\"King's\\" chamber, weigh 25 to 80 tonnes and were transported from Aswan, more than 800?km (500?mi) away. Traditionally,[clarification needed] ancient Egyptians cut stone blocks by hammering into them wooden wedges, which were then soaked with water. As the water was absorbed, the wedges expanded, causing the rock to crack. Once they were cut, they were carried by boat either up or down the Nile River to the pyramid.[16] It is estimated that 5.5?million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite (imported from Aswan), and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction of the Great Pyramid.[17]\\r\\nAt completion, the Great Pyramid was surfaced by white \\"casing stones\\"?ÿ slant-faced, but flat-topped, blocks of highly polished white limestone. These were carefully cut to what is approximately a face slope with a seked of 5? palms to give the required dimensions. Visibly, all that remains is the underlying stepped core structure seen today. In AD?1303, a massive earthquake loosened many of the outer casing stones, which were then carted away by Bahri Sultan An-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan in 1356 to build mosques and fortresses in nearby Cairo. Many more casing stones were removed from the great pyramids by Muhammad Ali Pasha in the early 19th century to build the upper portion of his Alabaster Mosque in Cairo not far from Giza. These limestone casings can still be seen as parts of these structures. Later explorers reported massive piles of rubble at the base of the pyramids left over from the continuing collapse of the casing stones, which were subsequently cleared away during continuing excavations of the site.\\r\\nNevertheless, a few of the casing stones from the lowest course can be seen to this day in situ around the base of the Great Pyramid, and display the same workmanship and precision that has been reported for centuries. Petrie also found a different orientation in the core and in the casing measuring 193?centimetres I 25 centimetres. He suggested a redetermination of north was made after the construction of the core, but a mistake was made, and the casing was built with a different orientation.[4] Petrie related the precision of the casing stones as to being \\"equal to opticians' work of the present day, but on a scale of acres\\" and \\"to place such stones in exact contact would be careful work; but to do so with cement in the joints seems almost impossible\\".[19] It has been suggested it was the mortar (Petrie's \\"cement\\") that made this seemingly impossible task possible, providing a level bed, which enabled the masons to set the stones exactly.[20][21]\\r\\nMany alternative, often contradictory, theories have been proposed regarding the pyramid's construction techniques.[22] Many disagree on whether the blocks were dragged, lifted, or even rolled into place. The Greeks believed that slave labour was used, but modern discoveries made at nearby workers' camps associated with construction at Giza suggest that it was built instead by tens of thousands of skilled workers. Verner posited that the labour was organized into a hierarchy, consisting of two gangs of 100,000 men, divided into five zaa or phyle of 20,000 men each, which may have been further divided according to the skills of the workers.[23]\\r\\nOne mystery of the pyramid's construction is its planning. John Romer suggests that they used the same method that had been used for earlier and later constructions, laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a 1-to-1 scale. He writes that \\"such a working diagram would also serve to generate the architecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means\\".[24] He also argues for a 14-year time span for its construction.[25] A modern construction management study, in association with Mark Lehner and other Egyptologists, estimated that the total project required an average workforce of about 14,500 people and a peak workforce of roughly 40,000. Without the use of pulleys, wheels, or iron tools, they used critical path analysis methods, which suggest that the Great Pyramid was completed from start to finish in approximately 10 years.[26]\\r\\nThe original entrance to the Great Pyramid is on the north, 17 metres (56?ft) vertically above ground level and 7.29 metres (23.9?ft) east of the centre line of the pyramid. From this original entrance, there is a Descending Passage 0.96 metres (3.1?ft) high and 1.04 metres (3.4?ft) wide, which goes down at an angle of 26 31'23\\" through the masonry of the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it. After 105.23 metres (345.2?ft), the passage becomes level and continues for an additional 8.84 metres (29.0?ft) to the lower Chamber, which appears not to have been finished. There is a continuation of the horizontal passage in the south wall of the lower chamber; there is also a pit dug in the floor of the chamber. Some Egyptologists suggest that this Lower Chamber was intended to be the original burial chamber, but Pharaoh Khufu later changed his mind and wanted it to be higher up in the pyramid.[27]\\r\\n28.2 metres (93?ft) from the entrance is a square hole in the roof of the Descending Passage. Originally concealed with a slab of stone, this is the beginning of the Ascending Passage. The Ascending Passage is 39.3 metres (129?ft) long, as wide and high as the Descending Passage and slopes up at almost precisely the same angle to reach the Grand Gallery. The lower end of the Ascending Passage is closed by three huge blocks of granite, each about 1.5 metres (4.9?ft) long. One must use the Robbers' Tunnel (see below) to access the Ascending Passage. At the start of the Grand Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole cut in the wall. This is the start of a vertical shaft which follows an irregular path through the masonry of the pyramid to join the Descending Passage. Also at the start of the Grand Gallery there is the Horizontal Passage leading to the \\"Queen's Chamber\\". The passage is 1.1m (3'8\\") high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step in the floor, after which the passage is 1.73 metres (5.7?ft) high.\\r\\nThe \\"Queen's Chamber\\"[1] is exactly halfway between the north and south faces of the pyramid and measures 5.75 metres (18.9?ft) north to south, 5.23 metres (17.2?ft) east to west, and has a pointed roof with an apex 6.23 metres (20.4?ft) above the floor. At the eastern end of the chamber there is a niche 4.67 metres (15.3?ft) high. The original depth of the niche was 1.04 metres (3.4?ft), but has since been deepened by treasure hunters.[28]\\r\\nIn the north and south walls of the Queen's Chamber there are shafts, which unlike those in the King's Chamber that immediately slope upwards (see below), are horizontal for around 2?m (6.6?ft) before sloping upwards. The horizontal distance was cut in 1872 by a British engineer, Waynman Dixon, who believed a shaft similar to those in the King's Chamber must also exist. He was proved right, but because the shafts are not connected to the outer faces of the pyramid or the Queen's Chamber, their purpose is unknown. At the end of one of his shafts, Dixon discovered a ball of black diorite (a type of rock) and a bronze implement of unknown purpose. Both objects are currently in the British Museum.[29]\\r\\nThe shafts in the Queen's Chamber were explored in 1993 by the German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink using a crawler robot he designed, Upuaut 2. After a climb of 65?m (213?ft),[30] he discovered that one of the shafts was blocked by limestone \\"doors\\" with two eroded copper \\"handles\\". Some years later the National Geographic Society created a similar robot which, in September 2002, drilled a small hole in the southern door, only to find another door behind it.[31] The northern passage, which was difficult to navigate because of twists and turns, was also found to be blocked by a door.[32]\\r\\nResearch continued in 2011 with the Djedi Project. Realizing the problem was that the National Geographic Society's camera was only able to see straight ahead of it, they instead used a fiber-optic \\"micro snake camera\\" that could see around corners. With this they were able to penetrate the first door of the southern shaft through the hole drilled in 2002, and view all the sides of the small chamber behind it. They discovered hieroglyphs written in red paint. They were also able to scrutinize the inside of the two copper \\"handles\\" embedded in the door, and they now believe them to be for decorative purposes. They also found the reverse side of the \\"door\\" to be finished and polished, which suggests that it was not put there just to block the shaft from debris, but rather for a more specific reason.[33]\\r\\nThe Grand Gallery continues the slope of the Ascending Passage, but is 8.6 metres (28?ft) high and 46.68 metres (153.1?ft) long. At the base it is 2.06 metres (6.8?ft) wide, but after 2.29 metres (7.5?ft) the blocks of stone in the walls are corbelled inwards by 7.6 centimetres (3.0?in) on each side. There are seven of these steps, so, at the top, the Grand Gallery is only 1.04 metres (3.4?ft) wide. It is roofed by slabs of stone laid at a slightly steeper angle than the floor of the gallery, so that each stone fits into a slot cut in the top of the gallery like the teeth of a ratchet. The purpose was to have each block supported by the wall of the Gallery, rather than resting on the block beneath it, in order to prevent cumulative pressure.[34]\\r\\nAt the upper end of the Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole near the roof that opens into a short tunnel by which access can be gained to the lowest of the Relieving Chambers. The other Relieving Chambers were discovered in 1837ÿ1838 by Colonel Howard Vyse and J. S. Perring, who dug tunnels upwards using blasting powder.\\r\\nThe floor of the Grand Gallery consists of a shelf or step on either side, 51 centimetres (20?in) wide, leaving a lower ramp 1.04 metres (3.4?ft) wide between them. In the shelves there are 54 slots, 27 on each side matched by vertical and horizontal slots in the walls of the Gallery. These form a cross shape that rises out of the slot in the shelf. The purpose of these slots is not known, but the central gutter in the floor of the Gallery, which is the same width as the Ascending Passage, has led to speculation that the blocking stones were stored in the Grand Gallery and the slots held wooden beams to restrain them from sliding down the passage.[35] This, in turn, has led to the proposal that originally many more than 3 blocking stones were intended, to completely fill the Ascending Passage.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the top of the Grand Gallery, there is a step giving onto a horizontal passage some metres long and approximately 1.02 metres (3.3?ft) in height and width, in which can be detected four slots, three of which were probably intended to hold granite portcullises. Fragments of granite found by Petrie in the Descending Passage may have come from these now-vanished doors.\\r\\nIn 2017, scientists from the Scan Pyramids Project discovered a large cavity above the Grand Gallery, using muon radiography that can detect cosmic rays. Its length is at least 30 metres (98?ft) and its cross-section is similar to that of the Grand Gallery. It was detected using three different technologies: nuclear emulsion films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors.[36][37] The purpose of the cavity is not known and it is not accessible but according to Zahi Hawass it may have been a gap used in the construction of the Grand Gallery.[38] The Japanese research team disputes this, however, saying that the huge void is completely different from the construction spaces previously identified.[39]\\r\\nThe \\"King's Chamber\\"[1] is 20 cubits or 10.47 metres (34.4?ft) from east to west and 10 cubits or 5.234 metres (17.17?ft) north to south. It has a flat roof 11 cubits and 5 digits or 5.852 metres (19 feet 2 inch) above the floor. 0.91?m (3.0?ft) above the floor there are two narrow shafts in the north and south walls (one is now filled by an extractor fan in an attempt to circulate air inside the pyramid). The purpose of these shafts is not clear: they appear to be aligned towards stars or areas of the northern and southern skies, yet one of them follows a dog-leg course through the masonry, indicating no intention to directly sight stars through them. They were long believed by Egyptologists to be \\"air shafts\\" for ventilation, but this idea has now been widely abandoned in favour of the shafts serving a ritualistic purpose associated with the ascension of the kings spirit to the heavens.[40]\\r\\nThe King's Chamber is entirely faced with granite. Above the roof, which is formed of nine slabs of stone weighing in total about 400 tons, are five compartments known as Relieving Chambers. The first four, like the King's Chamber, have flat roofs formed by the floor of the chamber above, but the final chamber has a pointed roof. Vyse suspected the presence of upper chambers when he found that he could push a long reed through a crack in the ceiling of the first chamber. From lower to upper, the chambers are known as \\"Davison's Chamber\\", \\"Wellington's Chamber\\", \\"Nelson's Chamber\\", \\"Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber\\", and \\"Campbell's Chamber\\". It is believed that the compartments were intended to safeguard the King's Chamber from the possibility of a roof collapsing under the weight of stone above the Chamber. As the chambers were not intended to be seen, they were not finished in any way and a few of the stones still retain masons' marks painted on them. One of the stones in Campbell's Chamber bears a mark, apparently the name of a work gang.[41][42]\\r\\nThe only object in the King's Chamber is a rectangular granite sarcophagus, one corner of which is broken. The sarcophagus is slightly larger than the Ascending Passage, which indicates that it must have been placed in the Chamber before the roof was put in place. Unlike the fine masonry of the walls of the Chamber, the sarcophagus is roughly finished, with saw marks visible in several places. This is in contrast with the finely finished and decorated sarcophagi found in other pyramids of the same period. Petrie suggested that such a sarcophagus was intended but was lost in the river on the way north from Aswan and a hurriedly made replacement was used instead.\\r\\nToday tourists enter the Great Pyramid via the Robbers' Tunnel, a tunnel purportedly created around AD 820 by Caliph al-Ma'mun's workmen using a battering ram.[43] The tunnel is cut straight through the masonry of the pyramid for approximately 27 metres (89?ft), then turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage. It is believed that their efforts dislodged the stone fitted in the ceiling of the Descending Passage to hide the entrance to the Ascending Passage and it was the noise of that stone falling and then sliding down the Descending Passage, which alerted them to the need to turn left. Unable to remove these stones, however, the workmen tunnelled up beside them through the softer limestone of the Pyramid until they reached the Ascending Passage. It is possible to enter the Descending Passage from this point, but access is usually forbidden.[44]\\r\\nThe Great Pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several buildings including small pyramids. The Pyramid Temple, which stood on the east side of the pyramid and measured 52.2 metres (171?ft) north to south and 40 metres (130?ft) east to west, has almost entirely disappeared apart from the black basalt paving. There are only a few remnants of the causeway which linked the pyramid with the valley and the Valley Temple. The Valley Temple is buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; basalt paving and limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated.[45][46] The basalt blocks show \\"clear evidence\\" of having been cut with some kind of saw with an estimated cutting blade of 15 feet (4.6?m) in length, capable of cutting at a rate of 1.5 inches (38?mm) per minute. John Romer suggests that this \\"super saw\\" may have had copper teeth and weighed up to 300 pounds (140?kg). He theorizes that such a saw could have been attached to a wooden trestle and possibly used in conjunction with vegetable oil, cutting sand, emery or pounded quartz to cut the blocks, which would have required the labour of at least a dozen men to operate it.[47]\\r\\nOn the south side are the subsidiary pyramids, popularly known as Queens' Pyramids. Three remain standing to nearly full height but the fourth was so ruined that its existence was not suspected until the recent discovery of the first course of stones and the remains of the capstone. Hidden beneath the paving around the pyramid was the tomb of Queen Hetepheres I, sister-wife of Sneferu and mother of Khufu. Discovered by accident by the Reisner expedition, the burial was intact, though the carefully sealed coffin proved to be empty.\\r\\nThe Giza pyramid complex, which includes among other structures the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, is surrounded by a cyclopean stone wall, the Wall of the Crow. Mark Lehner has discovered a worker's town outside of the wall, otherwise known as \\"The Lost City\\", dated by pottery styles, seal impressions, and stratigraphy to have been constructed and occupied sometime during the reigns of Khafre (2520ÿ2494 BC) and Menkaure (2490ÿ2472 BC).[48][49] Recent discoveries by Mark Lehner and his team at the town and nearby, including what appears to have been a thriving port, suggest the town and associated living quarters consisting of barracks called \\"galleries\\" may not have been for the pyramid workers after all, but rather for the soldiers and sailors who utilized the port. In light of this new discovery, as to where then the pyramid workers may have lived Lehner now suggests the alternative possibility they may have camped on the ramps he believes were used to construct the pyramids or possibly at nearby quarries.[50]\\r\\nIn the early 1970s, the Australian archaeologist Karl Kromer excavated a mound in the South Field of the plateau. This mound contained artefacts including mudbrick seals of Khufu, which he identified with an artisans' settlement.[51] Mudbrick buildings just south of Khufu's Valley Temple contained mud sealings of Khufu and have been suggested to be a settlement serving the cult of Khufu after his death.[52] A worker's cemetery used at least between Khufu's reign and the end of the Fifth Dynasty was discovered south of the Wall of the Crow by Zahi Hawass in 1990.[53]\\r\\nThere are three boat-shaped pits around the pyramid, of a size and shape to have held complete boats, though so shallow that any superstructure, if there ever was one, must have been removed or disassembled. In May 1954, the Egyptian archaeologist Kamal el-Mallakh discovered a fourth pit, a long, narrow rectangle, still covered with slabs of stone weighing up to 15 tons. Inside were 1,224 pieces of wood, the longest 23 metres (75?ft) long, the shortest 10 centimetres (0.33?ft). These were entrusted to a boat builder, Haj Ahmed Yusuf, who worked out how the pieces fit together. The entire process, including conservation and straightening of the warped wood, took fourteen years.\\r\\nThe result is a cedar-wood boat 43.6 metres (143?ft) long, its timbers held together by ropes, which is currently housed in a special boat-shaped, air-conditioned museum beside the pyramid. During construction of this museum, which stands above the boat pit, a second sealed boat pit was discovered. It was deliberately left unopened until 2011 when excavation began on the boat.[54]\\r\\nAlthough succeeding pyramids were smaller, pyramid building continued until the end of the Middle Kingdom. However, as authors Briar and Hobbs claim, \\"all the pyramids were robbed\\" by the New Kingdom, when the construction of royal tombs in a desert valley, now known as the Valley of the Kings, began.[55][56] Joyce Tyldesley states that the Great Pyramid itself \\"is known to have been opened and emptied by the Middle Kingdom\\", before the Arab caliph Abdullah al-Mamun entered the pyramid around AD 820.[43]\\r\\nI. E. S. Edwards discusses Strabo's mention that the pyramid \\"a little way up one side has a stone that may be taken out, which being raised up there is a sloping passage to the foundations\\". Edwards suggested that the pyramid was entered by robbers after the end of the Old Kingdom and sealed and then reopened more than once until Strabo's door was added. He adds: \\"If this highly speculative surmise be correct, it is also necessary to assume either that the existence of the door was forgotten or that the entrance was again blocked with facing stones\\", in order to explain why al-Ma'mun could not find the entrance.[57]\\r\\nHe also discusses a story told by Herodotus. Herodotus visited Egypt in the 5th century BC and recounts a story that he was told concerning vaults under the pyramid built on an island where the body of Cheops lies. Edwards notes that the pyramid had \\"almost certainly been opened and its contents plundered long before the time of Herodotus\\" and that it might have been closed again during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt when other monuments were restored. He suggests that the story told to Herodotus could have been the result of almost two centuries of telling and retelling by Pyramid guides.[58]","input":"When was the great pyramid of giza created?"},{"output":"May 21, 2006","context":"\\"Forever Charmed\\" is the last episode of the American supernatural-drama television series Charmed, and the 178th overall. It is the second part of the double-episode series finale of the show's eighth season. The episode was written by Brad Kern and directed by James L. Conway. It was originally broadcast in the United States on May 21, 2006 on The WB. \\"Forever Charmed\\" involves time travel, nostalgic family visitations and a reprise of various important historical background situations, as well as a glimpse of the future to other progeny of The Charmed Ones. It was watched by 4.5 million American viewers, becoming the highest rating episode of the season.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the cataclysmic battle between The Charmed Ones and the Jenkins sisters that demolished the manor and killed Phoebe (Alyssa Milano), Paige (Rose McGowan) and Christy (Marnette Patterson) in the previous episode \\"Kill Billie Vol. 2\\", Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Leo (Brian Krause) go to Phoebe's condo where the Book of Shadows was safeguarded because of the forces of evil that invaded the manor. While Piper and Leo look for some kind of solution to make her sisters alive again, Billie (Kaley Cuoco) goes to Magic School where she confronts Dumain (Anthony Cistaro), revealing Christy is dead. Dumain suggests that she project herself back into the past to save Christy. Piper and Leo arrive at her father Victor's (James Read) apartment and Piper breaks the news of Phoebe and Paige's deaths. A horrified Victor tells them that a cupid named Coop (Victor Webster) came to his apartment looking for Phoebe. Piper then realizes that Coop's ring has the ability to travel back in time to see past loves, and summons him so she can borrow the ring.[2]\\r\\nPiper and Leo use the ring to travel back in time to change the events that lead to the deaths of Phoebe and Paige. When Piper focuses on going back in time to Phoebe, she and Leo instead end up in 1975, when Phoebe was conceived and her parents were still together. Without giving away too much information, Piper tells her parents that she and Leo are from the future and that they travelled back in time to save Phoebe and Paige from death. Her mother Patty (Finola Hughes) insists on helping them out and tells Piper to form a three-generation Power of Three with her and Grams (Jennifer Rhodes). When Piper focuses on going back in time to Grams, they instead end up 50 years in the future, to the old aged Piper and Leo, where she is the Grams. They then travel to 1982 when Grams was comforting a 10-year-old Piper. Patty did not know she was dead at that time, and after Grams faints upon seeing her, Piper is forced to tell her.[2]\\r\\nMeanwhile, back at Magic School, Billie prepares to project herself into the past. When Dumain mentions she has to focus on the time of the existence of The Triad, she suspects something is up and finally realizes she has been manipulated. Dumain tells her to go back in time and ask Christy, so she will understand. When Grams wakes up, Patty tells her that her daughters grow up to become The Charmed Ones, and immediately wants to help. Meanwhile, Billie projects herself to the manor, during the time past Billie and Christy arrive to battle with The Charmed Ones. When she tries to warn the two about what will happen, past Billie sends her flying into a wall. When the battle begins, the three-generation Power of ThreeGrams, Patty and Piperarrive to recite a spell to remove The Hollow from the past Charmed Ones and past Billie and Christy, thus stopping the battle and changing the future. Present Billie and Piper then merge into their past selves, and Billie and Christy teleport out of the manor because they no longer have the magic boosting aid of The Hollow. The Angel of Destiny (Denise Dowse) arrives to take Leo back again because the battle did not occur. The future Wyatt (Wes Ramsey) and Chris (Drew Fuller) appear in the manor, revealing that someone has messed with their future.[2]\\r\\nWhen Billie tells Christy that The Triad and Dumain have been working together to use them to take out The Charmed Ones, Christy remains undeterred by this revelation and is determined to carry out their destiny of killing The Charmed Ones, with or without Billie. She realizes that Christy has become a killer, and returns to the manor to side with The Charmed Ones and ask for their forgiveness. Meanwhile, future Chris and Wyatt explain that Wyatt lost his powers in the middle of a demon fight, and Billie reveals that Dumain convinced her and Christy to steal baby Wyatt's powers to summon The Hollow to kill The Charmed Ones. When Coop arrives at the manor, Wyatt accidentally calls him Uncle Coop, letting it slip that he and Phoebe are together in the future. While the sisters and Grams go to Phoebe's condo to work on vanquishing potions, Patty and the boys visit present Victor's apartment and is shocked to find out that they are divorced. Christy tells Dumain that Billie has abandoned them, but believes there is a way to revive The Triad without her. When Paige's husband Henry (Ivan Sergei) arrives at the condo, Grams finds out that he is a mortal and is not pleased. When Coop confesses his love to Phoebe, she does not handle it well, believing that it is a forbidden love. She gives him his ring and returns to her sisters. Dumain then shimmers in and grabs Coop and the ring.[2]\\r\\nWhen Phoebe's calls for Coop fail, future Wyatt and Chris reveal that Coop was sent by The Elders to make up for all the events they put her through as a Charmed One, and that it is not a forbidden love. They also explain that in the future all she has to do is think about Coop to summon him. He then appears in great pain and reveals that Dumain took his ring so he and Christy can travel back in time. While she realizes it's too late to stop them, Billie has the ability to time travel too. When present Dumain and Christy arrive in the past, they warn The Triad to convince past Christy and Billie to invoke The Hollow before The Charmed Ones. Present Billie and The Charmed Ones arrive a moment later thanks to Billie focusing on Christy to vanquish The Triad, and Piper blows up the past and present versions of Dumain, leaving Christy without any allies. When Billie begs Christy to come back to the good side, Christy is enraged and launches a fireball at her sister which Billie deflects with telekinesis, vaporizing Christy. Billie immediately collapses in tears while the sisters feel her pain. A family reunion then takes place in the sun room of the manor and Wyatt reveals that he has his powers back. The Angel of Destiny returns with Leo and reveals that this was how the battle was supposed to end. Patty also reveals that she now knows of Prue's death thanks to Victor, and she understands and accepts her death because of Paige's existence. Coop takes Grams, Patty, Chris and Wyatt back to their own times and erases their memories of the recent events.[2]\\r\\nThe next day, Piper brings the Book of Shadows downstairs to Phoebe and Paige, and they each write a reflection of what has happened in the past years so future generations will know. Phoebe writes that over the last eight years, so much was gained and lost and that her life is really just beginning, after finding out that her true love is Coop. A flash of the future is shown where Phoebe and Coop are married and have two daughters while Phoebe is pregnant with their third. Billie, too, has gotten over Christy's death and she is seen as a babysitter for Phoebe's daughters. It also shows that Phoebe continues working at the Bay Mirror and ends up writing a self-help book on finding love. Paige writes about her and Henry's lives. It is shown in flashforwards that she accepts her role as a Whitelighter, aiding many witches and future Whitelighters that include her nieces and nephews. It also shows that Paige and Henry have three children, twin daughters and a son. Piper writes down how Paige passed on all that she learned about being a witch to her and Phoebe's kids. In a flash of the future, Piper and Leo have their third child, a daughter named Melinda. It also shows that Piper has her own restaurant, and Leo is back to teaching at Magic School. As Piper is reciting her passage, the future grandmother Piper is reading the passage to her granddaughter named Prudence. Piper's last message in the book is \\"Though we've certainly had our struggles and heartaches over the years, we're a family of survivors and we will always be, which is why we've truly been Charmed.\\" Prudence asks her to read it again, but the future Piper says she needs to go rest and that she can read it herself because the book will be hers one day. The future Piper and Leo then head upstairs while family photos hanging on the wall are shown. The episode ends with the rest of the Halliwell grandchildren running into the manor before Prudence closes the door with telekinesis, the same way Prue Halliwell (Shannen Doherty) did at the end of the first episode \\"Something Wicca This Way Comes\\". The final shot of the series is of the outside of the manor where the Triquetra symbol of the Power of Three flashes onto the screen before cutting to the credits.[2]\\r\\nIn 2016, Gavin Hetherington of SpoilerTV reflected on the series finale on its 10th anniversary on May 21.[3] He highlighted that 'Forever Charmed' was the best episode of the season, and that it was \\"the best way they could have ended, really, was to surround the finale with family - one of the main reasons people fell in love with the show.\\" He continues to mention the absence of Prue as something that lets him down, that \\"it will always kill me that she never appeared, or even had her photo on the wall\\". He concludes by saying \\"could they have really had a better ending?\\"","input":"When did the last episode of charmed air?"},{"output":"in 1348","context":"The Order of the Garter (formally the Most Noble Order of the Garter) is an order of chivalry founded by Edward III in 1348 and regarded as the most prestigious British order of chivalry (though in precedence inferior to the military Victoria Cross and George Cross) in England and the United Kingdom. It is dedicated to the image and arms of Saint George, England's patron saint.\\r\\nAppointments are made at the Sovereign's sole discretion. Membership of the Order is limited to the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and no more than 24 members, or Companions. The order also includes supernumerary knights and ladies (e.g., members of the British Royal Family and foreign monarchs). New appointments to the Order of the Garter are often announced on St George's Day (23 April), as Saint George is the order's patron saint.[2]\\r\\nThe order's emblem is a garter with the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense (Middle French: \\"Shame on him who thinks ill of it\\") in gold lettering. Members of the order wear it on ceremonial occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Edward III founded the Order of the Garter around the time of his claim to the French throne.[1] The year is usually presumed to be 1348; however, the Complete Peerage, under \\"The Founders of the Order of the Garter\\", states the order was first instituted on 23 April 1344, listing each founding member as knighted in 1344. The list includes Sir Sanchet D'Abrichecourt, who died on 20 October 1345.[3] Other dates from 1344 to 1351 have also been proposed. The King's wardrobe account shows Garter habits first issued in the autumn of 1348. Also, its original statutes required that each member of the Order already be a knight (what would now be referred to as a knight bachelor) and some of the initial members listed were only knighted that year.[4]\\r\\nThe earliest written mention of the Order is found in Tirant lo Blanch, a chivalric romance written in Catalan mainly by Valencian Joanot Martorell. It was first published in 1490. This book devotes a chapter to the description of the origin of the Order of the Garter.[5]\\r\\nAt the time of its foundation, the Order consisted of King Edward III, together with 25 Founder Knights, listed in ascending order of stall number in St George's Chapel:[6]\\r\\nThey are all depicted in individual portraits in the Bruges Garter Book made c. 1431.\\r\\nVarious legends account for the origin of the Order. The most popular involves the \\"Countess of Salisbury\\", whose garter is said to have slipped from her leg while she was dancing at a court ball at Calais. When the surrounding courtiers sniggered, the king picked it up and returned it to her, exclaiming, \\"Honi soit qui mal y pense!\\" (\\"Shame on him who thinks ill of it!\\"), the phrase that has become the motto of the Order.[1]\\r\\nAccording to another legend, King Richard I was inspired in the 12th century by St George the Martyr while fighting in the Crusades to tie garters around the legs of his knights, who subsequently won the battle. King Edward supposedly recalled the event in the 14th century when he founded the Order.[4] This story is recounted in a letter to the Annual Register in 1774:[7]\\r\\nIn Rastel's Chronicle, I. vi. under the life of Edward III is the following curious passage: \\"About the 19 yere [sic] of this kinge, he made a solempne feest at Wyndesore, and a greate justes and turnament, where he devysed, and perfyted substanegally, the order of the knyghtes of the garter; howe be it some afferme that this order began fyrst by kynge Rycharde, Cure de Lyon, at the sege of the citye of Acres; where, in his great necessyte, there were but 26 knyghtes that fyrmely and surely abode by the kynge; where he caused all them to were thonges of blew leyther about theyr legges. And afterwarde they were called the knyghtes of the blew thonge.\\" I am obliged for this passage to John Fenn, Esq; a curious and ingenious gentleman of East-Dereham, in Norfolk, who is in possession of the most rare book whence it is taken. Hence some affirm, that the origin of the garter is to be dated from Richard I* and that it owes its pomp and splendor to Edward III.\\r\\nThe motto in fact refers to Edward's claim to the French throne, and the Order of the Garter was created to help pursue this claim. The use of the garter as an emblem may have derived from straps used to fasten armour.[1]\\r\\nThere is a connection between the Order of the Garter and the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (late 14th century). The motto is inscribed, as hony soyt qui mal pence, at the end of the text in the manuscript, albeit in a later hand.[8] In the poem, a girdle, very similar in its erotic undertones to the garter, plays a prominent role. A rough equivalent of the Order's motto has been identified in Gawain's exclamation corsed worth cowarddyse and couetyse bote (\\"cursed be both cowardice and coveting\\", v. 2374).[9] While the author of that poem remains disputed, there seems to be a connection between two of the top candidates and the Order of the Garter, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and Enguerrand de Coucy, seventh Sire de Coucy. De Coucy was married to King Edward III's daughter, Isabella, and was given admittance to the Order of the Garter on their wedding day.\\"[10]\\r\\nSoon after the founding of the Order, women were appointed \\"Ladies of the Garter\\", but were not made companions. King Henry VII discontinued the practice in 1488; his mother, Margaret Beaufort, was the last Lady of the Garter before Queen Alexandra. Except for female sovereigns, the next Lady of the Garter named was Queen Alexandra, by her husband King Edward VII. King George V also made his consort, Queen Mary, a Lady of the Garter and King George VI subsequently did the same for his wife, Queen Elizabeth. Throughout the 20th century, women continued to be associated with the Order, but except for foreign female monarchs, they were not made companions.[11] In 1987, however, it became possible to install \\"Ladies Companion of the Garter\\" under a statute of Queen Elizabeth II.[12]\\r\\nMembership in the Order is strictly limited and includes the Monarch, the Prince of Wales, not more than 24 companion members, and various supernumerary members. The monarch alone can grant membership.[13] He or she is known as the Sovereign of the Garter, and the Prince of Wales is known as a Royal Knight Companion of the Garter.[14]\\r\\nMale members of the Order are titled \\"Knights Companion\\" and female members are called \\"Ladies Companion\\". Formerly, the Sovereign filled vacancies upon the nomination of the members. Each member would nominate nine candidates, of whom three had to have the rank of earl or higher, three the rank of baron or higher, and three the rank of knight or higher. The Sovereign would choose as many nominees as were necessary to fill any vacancies in the Order. He or she was not obliged to choose those who received the most nominations. Candidates were last nominated in 1860, and appointments have since been made by the Sovereign acting alone, with no prior nominations. The statutes prescribing the former procedure were not amended, however, until 1953.[15]:198\\r\\nFrom the 18th century, the Sovereign made his or her choices on the advice of the Government. In 1946, with the agreement of the Prime Minister Clement Attlee and the Leader of the Opposition Winston Churchill, membership of the United Kingdom's highest ranking orders of chivalry (the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the dormant Order of St. Patrick) became a personal gift of the Sovereign once again.[11] Thus, the Sovereign personally selects Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, and need not act on or solicit the advice of His or Her Government.[16]\\r\\nIn addition, the Order includes supernumerary members, who do not count towards the limit of 24 companions. Several supernumerary members, known as \\"Royal Knights and Ladies of the Garter\\", belong to the royal family. These titles were introduced in 1786 by King George III so that his many sons would not count towards the limit on the number of companions. He created the statute of supernumerary members in 1805 so that any descendant of King George II could be installed as such a member. In 1831, this statute was extended again to include all descendants of King George I.[4]\\r\\nWith the installation of Emperor Alexander I of Russia in 1813, supernumerary membership was extended to foreign monarchs, who are known as \\"Stranger Knights and Ladies of the Garter\\".[17] Each such installation originally required the enactment of a statute; however, a 1954 statute authorises the regular admission of Stranger Knights or Ladies without further special enactments.[17] In lesser orders of chivalry, such foreign members would be regarded as having received honorary knighthoods.\\r\\nTraditionally, reigning European monarchs are admitted to the Order as Strangers. Constantine II, King of the Hellenes has not succeeded his father Paul of Greece as a member of the Order, neither during his short reign nor after being deposed. Similarly, Albert II, King of the Belgians and his son and successor Philippe are the only Belgian monarchs to date not to have been admitted to the Order.\\r\\nFor a time, both Juliana, Queen of the Netherlands and her successor, Queen Beatrix were concurrently members of the Order as Stranger Ladies of the Garter. Juan Carlos I of Spain and his successor Felipe VI of Spain are concurrently Stranger Knights of the Garter.\\r\\nThe Sovereign may \\"degrade\\" members who have committed very serious crimes, such as treason or fleeing the battlefield, or those who have taken up arms against the Sovereign.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrom the late 15th century, there was a formal ceremony of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied by the rest of the heralds, proceeded to St George's Chapel. While the Garter King of Arms read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the quire. Then the rest of the heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel, out of the doors, and into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of James, Duke of Ormonde in 1716.[18]\\r\\nDuring the First World War, two Royal Knights and six Stranger Knights, all monarchs or princes of enemy nations and including Wilhelm II, German Emperor and Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria were struck off the roll of the Order or had their appointments annulled in 1915.[17]\\r\\nThe banner of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy was also removed from the chapel after Italy entered World War II against the United Kingdom and her Allies.[19] The banner of Emperor Hirohito of Japan was removed from St. George's chapel when Japan entered World War II in 1941, but that banner and the Japanese monarch's knighthood were restored by Elizabeth II in 1971, when Hirohito made a state visit to the United Kingdom. The Emperor was particularly pleased by the restoration of his banner as a Knight of the Garter.[20]\\r\\nThe Order has six officers: the Prelate, the Chancellor, the Register, the Garter Principal King of Arms, the Usher, and the Secretary.[21] The offices of Prelate, Register, and Usher were created on the order's establishment; those of Garter Principal King of Arms and Chancellor, in the 15th century; and that of Secretary, in the 20th century.[22]\\r\\nWilliam of Edington, Bishop of Winchester, was the first Prelate of the Order, and that office has since been held by his successors at Winchester, traditionally a senior bishopric of the Church of England.[15]:105\\r\\nThe office of Chancellor is now held by one of the companions of the order. For most of its existence, the Bishop of Salisbury has held the office, although laymen held it from 1553 to 1671. In 1837, after boundary changes made Windsor Castle fall in the diocese of Oxford, the Chancellorship was transferred to the Bishop of Oxford. A century later, the Bishop of Salisbury challenged this transfer, on the grounds that the Chancellorship had been attached to his office regardless of the diocese in which the chapel of the order lay; and that, in any event, St George's Chapel, as a Royal Peculiar, was not under diocesan jurisdiction. The office of Chancellor was removed from the Bishop of Oxford (the outgoing bishop, Thomas Strong, had been outspoken in the abdication crisis of Edward VIII), and so it was withheld from his successor, Kenneth Kirk, and has since been held by one of the Knights Companion.[15]:109ÿ112 Since 1937, the following members have held the post of Chancellor:[citation needed]\\r\\nThe office of Register has been held by the Dean of Windsor since 1558.[15]:116 The Garter Principal King of Arms is ex officio the senior officer of the College of Arms (the heraldic authority of England), and is usually appointed from among the other officers of arms at the College.[15]:122 As the title suggests, Garter Principal King of Arms has specific duties as the Order's officer of arms, attending to the companions' crests and banners of arms, which are exhibited in the chapel. The Secretary, who acts as deputy to Garter in the ceremonial aspects of the Order, has since 1952 also been selected from the other officers of the College of Arms.[15]:143 The office of Usher is held by the Usher of the Black Rod, who is also the Serjeant-at-Arms of the United Kingdom House of Lords[15]:132 (although their functions are more often performed there by a deputy, the Yeoman Usher).[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the founding of the Order of the Garter, 26 \\"poor knights\\" were appointed and attached to the Order and its chapel. This number was not always maintained, and by the 17th century, there were only thirteen such knights. King Charles II increased the number to 18 (in large part because of funds allocated from Sir Francis Crane's will) after his coronation in 1660. After the knights objected to being termed \\"poor\\", King William IV redesignated them in the 19th century as the Military Knights of Windsor.[23]\\r\\nThe poor knights were impoverished military veterans, required to pray daily for the Knights Companion. In return, they received a salary and lodging in Windsor Castle. The knights are no longer necessarily poor, but are still military pensioners. They participate in the Order's processions, escorting the members, and in the chapel services. However, they are not considered members of the Order.[23]\\r\\nThe poor knights originally wore red mantles, each of which bore St George's Cross, but did not depict the Garter. Queen Elizabeth I replaced the mantles in the 16th and 17th centuries with blue and purple gowns, but the red mantles returned in the 17th century under King Charles I. When the knights were renamed, the mantles were abandoned. The military knights now wear the old military uniform of an \\"army officer on the unattached list\\": black trousers with red stripe, a red double-breasted swallow-tailed coat, gold epaulets and brushes, a cocked hat with a plume, and a sword on a white sash.[24]\\r\\nFor the Order's ceremonial occasions, such as the annual Garter Day, the members wear elaborate vestments and accoutrements, which include:\\r\\nUp until the middle part of the 20th century, it was customary to wear Tudor style under-dress, consisting of white silk embroidered doublet, breeches, full hose, white doeskin pumps with satin bows and a sword belt with sword, under the robes. Nowadays, morning dress or a lounge suit is worn, except for coronations when Tudor under-dress is worn by the canopy-bearers.[28]\\r\\nOn other occasions when decorations are worn, the members wear simpler insignia:\\r\\nOn the death of a member, the Lesser George and breast star are returned personally to the Sovereign by the former member's nearest male relative, and the other insignia to the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, save the riband, mantle and hat.[24]\\r\\nFor ceremonial occasions of the Order, the officers wear the following garments and accessories:\\r\\nThe chancellor carries a purse, which is embroidered with the royal arms impaled by the Cross of St. George. The purse contains the seal of the Order. Garter Principal King of Arms carries his baton of office. The usher carries their staff of office, the Black Rod.[24]\\r\\nSt George's Chapel in Windsor is the mother church of the Order of the Garter. Special service are held annually in June. The Order of the Garter once held services at the chapel, but they became rare in the 18th century.[citation needed] The annual Garter Services, discontinued in 1805, were revived by King George VI in 1948 and have become an annual event.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring their lifetime, all members of the Order of the Garter are entitled to display their heraldic crests and banners in St. George's Chapel. While the Garter stall plates (see below) stay in the chapel permanently, the crests and banners of deceased knights are, following presentation at the High Altar, removed from the chapel. Sometimes they are then given to institutions that were connected with the late knight, or kept privately depending on family wishes.[29] Originally after a knight's death, the crests became the property of Garter King of Arms, and these crests have been the subject of occasional exhibitions in the Earl Marshal's Court at the College of Arms.\\r\\nGarter stall plates are small enamelled and engraved brass plates located in St George's Chapel as memorials to Knights of the Garter. They are inscribed with the knight's name, and generally with his titles, offices, and motto. In most cases his heraldic achievement is depicted.\\r\\nEach June, on Garter Day, the members of the Order, wearing their habits and garter insignia, meet at Windsor Castle. When any new Knights of the Garter are due for installation, an investiture ceremony is held in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle on the morning of Garter Day.[30] This ceremony is attended by all Knights Companions of the order, wearing the ceremonial habits and garter insignia, and also by their wives. The wording of the oath sworn by the new knights at this ceremony and of the Admonitions addressed to them in turn by the prelate and chancellor of the order when the several items of insignia are placed upon them are extremely similar to the traditions of the past.[31][32]\\r\\nAt the investiture ceremony the Admonitions are read in turn by the prelate and chancellor of the order and several insignia are offered on a cushion to the Sovereign by Garter King of Arms, Black Rod, and the secretary of the order, in turn, so that the Sovereign may perform the ceremony of investiture.[citation needed] Two senior knights of the order assist the Sovereign in these ceremonies by placing the garter around the left leg of the new knight and by assisting the Sovereign in the fastening of the riband and Lesser George about the body of the new knight, and in the adjustment of the mantle and the collar.[33] After the investiture ceremony at Windsor is concluded, a state luncheon is held in the Banqueting Room. This is attended by the royal family, by all the Companions of the Order and their spouses, and by the Officers of the Order. After the banquet all the knights and ladies of the order, together with the prelate, chancellor and other officers of the order, in their mantles and ceremonial robes, led by the Military Knights of Windsor, move in procession, watched by a great crowd of spectators, through the castle, down the hill, which is lined with troops, to Saint George's Chapel for a worship service, before which the formal installation of the new knights takes place.[34]\\r\\nWhile knights continued to be invested with their ensigns, the formal installation of knights at St. George's Chapel ceased in 1805. Installation, along with the annual Garter service, returned in 1948;[35] on the occasion on the order's 600th anniversary.[36]\\r\\nMembers are assigned positions in the order of precedence, coming before all others of knightly rank, and above baronets. The wives, sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Companion are also assigned precedence. Relatives of Ladies Companion are not, however, assigned any special positions. (Generally, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their mothers or wives.) The Chancellor is also assigned precedence, but except for the period between 1553 and 1671 when the office was held by a layman who was not necessarily a member of the Order, this precedence has been purely theoretical.[citation needed] As a member of the Order, the Chancellor has a higher precedence than that attached to the office, and when the office was filled by a diocesan bishop of the Church of England, the holder again had a higher precedence by virtue of that office than any that the chancellorship could bestow.[37]\\r\\nKnights Companion prefix \\"Sir\\"[38] and Ladies Companion prefix \\"Lady\\" to their forenames.[39] Wives of Knights Companion may prefix \\"Lady\\" to their surnames, but no corresponding privilege exists for husbands of Ladies Companion.[40] Such forms are not used by royalty, peers, peeresses, or Anglican clergymen, who instead use only the post-nominal letters.[38]\\r\\nKnights and Ladies Companion use the post-nominal letters \\"KG\\" and \\"LG\\" respectively.[16] When an individual is entitled to use multiple post-nominal letters, those of the Order of the Garter appear before all others, except \\"Bt\\" or \\"Bart\\" (Baronet), \\"VC\\" (Victoria Cross) and \\"GC\\" (George Cross).[41]\\r\\nIn their heraldic achievements, members of the Order of the Garter may encircle their escutcheon with the Garter.[42] Knights and Ladies Companion are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters, a privilege granted to few other private individuals. While some families claim supporters by ancient use, and others have been granted them as a special reward, only members of the Royal Family, peers, Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, Knights and Ladies of the Thistle, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders of chivalry are automatically entitled to them.[42]\\r\\nGarter Banner of the late Alexander Baring, 6th Baron Ashburton, now in Winchester Cathedral\\r\\nGarter Banner of the late Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos, now at Hagley Hall\\r\\nGarter Banner of the late Lord Wilson of Rievaulx, now at Jesus College Chapel, Oxford\\r\\nArms of Philip of Spain, encircled by the Garter (In 1554)\\r\\nGarter stall plate of George, 5th Earl Cadogan\\r\\nArms of the late Margaret Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher\\r\\nThe arms of John, Duke of Marlborough, are encircled by both the Garter and the collar.\\r\\nThe arms of John Casimir of the Palatinate-Simmern, encircled by the Garter\\r\\nCoat of Arms of Henry III of France as King of France and lifelong King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania with chain of Order of the Garter.","input":"When was the order of the garter founded?"},{"output":"Rin Nohara","context":"","input":"What is rin's last name in naruto?"},{"output":"Middle Island","context":"Middle Island is a small island, just 18.5 hectares (46 acres) in size.[1] It is the southernmost point of land in Canada, located at 4141'N, 8241\\"W (41.685,-82.684), or about 41.7 degrees north latitude.

The distance to the northernmost point of land in CanadaCape Columbia, Ellesmere Islandis 4,640 kilometres (2,883 miles).\\r\\nThe southernmost point of Middle Island is at a latitude of North 4140'53\\", which is at a slightly lower latitude than the southernmost point in Michigan and slightly farther south than downtown Chicago. Twenty-seven U.S. states lie all or partly north of this point, as do European cities such as Rome and Barcelona. Thirteen states are entirely north of this latitude (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine).[2] California, albeit only its northernmost edge, is one of the states that lies partially north of Middle Island, as the California/Oregon border is at the 42nd parallel north.\\r\\nThere are no permanent settlements on Middle Island, as the entire island is a conservation area. The most common species are double-crested cormorants, though several others also nest there. The birds are so plentiful that in May 2008, Parks Canada attempted to cull the number of cormorants from more than 4000 nests to between 400 and 800.[3] It once was the site of a lighthouse, built in 1872 but which fell into disuse by 1918.\\r\\nThe 15-metre (49?ft) pyramidal square tower burned sometime afterward, but its stone foundation is visible. Located in Canadian waters, and hence indisputably under Canadian sovereignty, the island was privately owned for years by various U.S. owners. Subsequently, Middle Island was purchased in 1999 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and then donated to the Canadian national park system on September 6, 2000.\\r\\nArchaeological evidence from a study done in 1982 suggests human occupation dating from 1000-1500 A.D., with one site containing remains that may date to 500 B.C. Others claim that the island has seen inhabitation for more than 10,000 years.[4] Despite early rumours of burial mounds, none were found.\\r\\nThe island is part of an archipelago across western Lake Erie, providing a natural migratory corridor for birds and other animals. It has also seen human migrations, mainly from the U.S. northward in the 19th century, including escaped slaves, prisoners of war and army deserters from the U.S. Civil War seeking asylum in mainland Ontario.\\r\\nThroughout the later decades of the 19th century, parts of Middle Island were used for growing grapes to be used in the production of wine, as was being done on Pelee Island.[4]\\r\\nDuring Prohibition, the island was a way station for alcohol en route to the United States on the south shore of Lake Erie. Gangster Joe Roscoe acquired part of the island and built a seven-bedroom \\"clubhouse\\" that became the centre of rum-running activity. The hotel offered electricity, fireplaces, and a large screened-in porch with views of the lake. The basement held a casino, carved out of solid bedrock.[5]\\r\\nIn the years after 1933, after the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution resulted in the repeal of the Volstead Act, the hotel drew as many as 200 visitors a day in peak season. Its kitchen became known for pheasant dinners.[5]\\r\\nLikely prior to the 1950s,[5] there was an airstrip of about 275 metres (900 feet) in length. The runway began and ended in water, and is now choked with vegetation.[5]\\r\\nThere was at one time a stately mansion on the island, rumoured to be a brothel some time after Prohibition.[5] Only a remnant of the foundation remains.\\r\\nWhen purchased in 1999 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada, the island had no physical improvements and had essentially become a nature preserve over the last ten years, hosting the occasional scientific visit, and curious boaters. Although part of Point Pelee National Park, Middle Island is not officially open to visitors.\\r\\nInterest in preserving the island prompted a 1982 study by Parks Canada, which recommended naming it a national natural landmark. Its ecological, historical, and aesthetic value led Essex County to include it on its list of Environmentally Sensitive Areas and an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. A conservation group, Carolinian Canada Coalition, named Middle Island one of 38 critical unprotected sites in its effort to preserve remnants of Ontario's southern forests.\\r\\nCoordinates: 414057N 82414W? / ?41.68250N 82.68444W? / 41.68250; -82.68444","input":"Where is the southern most part of canada?"},{"output":"began in 1775.","context":"The history of the United States Army began in 1775. From its formation, the United States Army has been the primary land based part of the United States Armed Forces. The Army's main responsibility has been in fighting land battles and military occupation. The Corps of Engineers also has a major role in controlling rivers inside the United States. The Continental Army was founded in response to a need for professional soldiers in the American Revolutionary War to fight the invading British Army. Until the 1940s, the Army was relatively small in peacetime. In 1947, the Air Force became completely independent of the Army Air Forces. The Army was under the control of the War Department until 1947, and since then the Defense Department. The U.S. Army fought the Indian Wars of the 1790s, the War of 1812 (1812ÿ15), American Civil War (1861ÿ65), SpanishÿAmerican War (1898), World War I (1917ÿ18), World War II (1941ÿ45), Korean War (1950ÿ53) and Vietnam War (1965ÿ71). Following the Cold War's end in 1991, Army has focused primarily on Western Asia, and also took part in the 1991 Gulf War and war in Iraq, and the war in Afghanistan.\\r\\nWhen the American Revolutionary War began in April 1775, the colonial revolutionaries did not have an army. Previously, each colony had relied upon the militia, made up of part-time civilian-soldiers. The initial orders from Congress authorized ten companies of riflemen. The first full regiment of Regular Army infantry, the 3rd Infantry Regiment, was not formed until June 1784.[1] After the war, the Continental Army was quickly disbanded because of the American distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the new nation's sole ground army, with the exception of a regiment to guard the Western Frontier and one battery of artillery guarding West Point's arsenal.\\r\\nDuring the War of 1812, an invasion of Canada failed, and U.S. troops were unable to stop the British from burning the new capital of Washington, D.C.. However, the Regular Army, under Generals Winfield Scott and Jacob Brown, proved they were professional and capable of defeating a major invasion by the regular British Army in the Niagara campaign of 1814. Between 1815 and 1860, the main role of the U.S. Army was fighting Native Americans in the West in the American Indian Wars, and manning coast artillery stations at major ports. The U.S. used regular units and many volunteer units in the Mexican-American War of 1846-48. At the outset of the American Civil War, the regular U.S. Army was small and generally assigned to defend the nation's frontiers from attacks by Native Americans. Following the Civil War, the U.S. Army fought more wars with Native Americans, who resisted U.S. expansion into the center of the continent.\\r\\nA combined conscript and volunteer force, the National Army, was formed by the United States War Department in 1917 to fight in World War I. During World War II, the Army of the United States was formed as a successor to the National Army. The end of World War II set the stage for the ideological confrontation known as the Cold War. With the outbreak of the Korean War, concerns over the defense of Western Europe led to the establishment of NATO. During the Cold War, American troops and their allies fought communist forces in Korea and Vietnam (see containment). The 1980s was mostly a decade of reorganization. The Army converted to an all-volunteer force with greater emphasis on training and technology. By 1989, the Cold War was coming to a close. The Army leadership reacted by starting to plan for a reduction in strength. After Desert Storm, the Army did not see major combat operations for the remainder of the 1990s. After the September 11 attacks, and as part of the War on Terror, U.S. and other NATO forces invaded Afghanistan in 2001, replacing the Taliban government. The Army took part in the U.S. and allied 2003 invasion of Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Continental Army consisted of troops from all 13 colonies. When the American Revolutionary War began at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, the colonial revolutionaries did not have an army. Previously, each colony had relied upon the militia, made up of part-time civilian-soldiers, for local defense, or the raising of temporary \\"provincial regiments\\" during specific crises such as the French and Indian War. As tensions with Great Britain increased in the years leading up to the war, colonists began to reform their militia in preparation for the potential conflict. Training of militiamen increased after the passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774. Colonists such as Richard Henry Lee proposed creating a national militia force, but the First Continental Congress rejected the idea.[2]\\r\\nOn April 23, 1775, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress authorized the raising of a colonial army consisting of 26 company regiments, followed shortly by similar but smaller forces raised by New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. On June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress decided to proceed with the establishment of a Continental Army for purposes of common defense, adopting the forces already in place outside Boston (22,000 troops) and New York (5,000). It also raised the first ten companies of Continental troops on a one-year enlistment, riflemen from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia to be used as light infantry, who later became the 1st Continental Regiment in 1776. On June 15, the Congress elected George Washington as Commander-in-Chief by unanimous vote.\\r\\nWashington succeeded in forcing the British out of Boston in 1776, but was defeated and almost captured later that year when he lost New York City. After crossing the Delaware River in the dead of winter, he defeated the British in two battles, retook New Jersey and restored momentum to the Patriot cause. Because of his strategy, Revolutionary forces captured two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781. Historians laud Washington for his selection and supervision of his generals, encouragement of morale and ability to hold together the army, coordination with the state governors and state militia units, relations with Congress and attention to supplies, logistics, and training. In battle, however, Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies. After victory had been achieved in 1783, Washington resigned rather than seize power, proving his opposition to military dictatorship and his commitment to American republicanism.[3]\\r\\nThe initial orders from Congress authorized ten companies of riflemen. However, the first full regiment of Regular Army infantry, the 3rd Infantry Regiment was not formed until June 1784.[1]\\r\\nAfter the authorization of the creation of a Continental Army, Congress, on 16 June 1775, created multiple departments to help support the operations of the Army. These four departments would later be renamed as Corps: the Adjutant General's Corps, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Finance Corps and the Quartermasters Corps. Congress later authorized both the creation of Field Artillery and Cavalry units in November 1775 and December 1776 respectively.[1]\\r\\nBroadly speaking, Continental forces consisted of several successive armies, or establishments:\\r\\nIn addition to the Continental Army regulars, local militia units, raised and funded by individual colonies/states, participated in battles throughout the war. Sometimes, the militia units operated independently of the Continental Army, but often local militias were called out to support and augment the Continental Army regulars during campaigns. (The militia troops developed a reputation for being prone to premature retreats, a fact that was integrated into the strategy at the Battle of Cowpens.)\\r\\nAfter the war the Continental Army was quickly disbanded as part of the American distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the new nation's sole ground army, with the exception of a regiment to guard the Western Frontier and one battery of artillery guarding West Point's arsenal. However, because of continuing conflict with Native Americans, it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the Legion of the United States, was established in 1791.\\r\\nThe War of 1812, the second and last American war against the British, was less successful than the Revolution had been. An invasion of Canada failed, and U.S. troops were unable to stop the British from burning the new capital of Washington, D.C.. However, the Regular Army, under Generals Winfield Scott and Jacob Brown, proved they were professional and capable of defeating a major invasion by the regular British army in the Niagara campaign of 1814. The nation celebrated the Army's great victory under Andrew Jackson, at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815, thus ending the war on a high note.\\r\\nThe multiple failures and fiascos of the War of 1812 convinced Washington that thorough reform of the War Department was necessary. Secretary of War John C. Calhoun reorganized the department into a system of bureaus, whose chiefs held office for life, and a commanding general in the field, although the Congress did not authorize this position. Through the 1840s and 1850s, Winfield Scott was the senior general, only retiring at the start of the American Civil War in 1861. The bureau chiefs acted as advisers to the Secretary of War while commanding their own troops and field installations. The bureaus frequently conflicted among themselves, but in disputes with the commanding general, the Secretary of War generally supported the bureaus. Congress regulated the affairs of the bureaus in detail, and their chiefs looked to that body for support.[4]\\r\\nCalhoun set up the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1824, the main agency within the War Department for dealing with Native Americans until 1849, when the Congress transferred it to the newly founded Department of the Interior.[5][6]\\r\\nBetween 1815 and 1860, the main role of the Army was control of Indians in the West, and manning coast artillery stations at major ports. Most of the forces were stationed on the frontier, or and coastal defense units near seaports.[7]\\r\\nTransportation was a key issue and the Army (especially the Army Corps of Engineers) was given full responsibility for facilitating navigation on the rivers. The steamboat, first used on the Ohio River in 1811, made possible inexpensive travel using the river systems, especially the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and their tributaries.[8] Army expeditions up the Missouri River in 1818ÿ25 allowed engineers to improve the technology. For example, the Army's steamboat \\"Western Engineer\\" of 1819 combined a very shallow draft with one of the earliest stern wheels. In 1819ÿ25 Colonel Henry Atkinson developed keelboats with hand-powered paddle wheels.[9]\\r\\nInternally the main military action involved the years of warfare with the Seminole Indians in Florida. They refused to move west and effectively used the terrain as a defense. The First Seminole War was from 1814 to 1819, the Second Seminole War from 1835 to 1842, and the Third Seminole War from 1855 to 1858.[10]\\r\\nThe U.S. used regular units and many volunteer units to fight Mexico, 1846ÿ48. The American strategy was threefold: to take control of the Southwest (New Mexico and California); to invade Mexico from the North under general Zachary Taylor.[11] Finally to land troops and capture Mexico City with an army under General Winfield Scott.[12] All the operations were successful; the Americans won all the major battles.\\r\\nThe army expanded from 6,000 regulars to more than 115,000. Of these, approximately 1.5% were killed in the fighting and nearly 10% died of disease; another 12% were wounded or discharged because of disease.[13][14]\\r\\nAt the outset of the American Civil War the regular U.S. army was small and generally assigned to defend the nation's frontiers from attacks by Native Americans. As one after another Southern state seceded many experienced officers and men resigned or left to join the Confederate States Army, further limiting the regular army's abilities.\\r\\nThe attack on Fort Sumter by South Carolina militia marked the beginning of hostilities. Both sides recruited large numbers of men into a new Volunteer Army, recruited and formed by the states. Regiments were recruited locally, with company officers elected by the men. Although many officers in the regular army accepted commissions in the new volunteer units outsiders were not usually welcome as officers, unless they were surgeons whose value was obvious.[15] Colonels ÿ often local politicians who helped raise the troops ÿ were appointed by the governors, and generals were appointed by President Abraham Lincoln.\\r\\nThe Volunteer Army was so much larger than the Regular Army that entirely new units above the regimental level had to be formed. The grand plan involved geographical theaters, with armies (named after rivers such as the Army of the Potomac in the Eastern Theater) comprising brigades, divisions and corps headquarters.[16]\\r\\nThe rapidly growing armies were relatively poorly trained when the first major battle of the war occurred at Bull Run in the middle of 1861. The embarrassing Union defeat and subsequent inability of the Confederacy to capitalize on their victory resulted in both sides spending more time organizing and training their green armies. Much of the subsequent actions taken in 1861 were skirmishes between pro-Union and pro-Confederacy irregular forces in border states like Missouri and Kentucky.\\r\\nIn 1862 the war became much more bloody, though neither side was able to gain a lasting strategic advantage over the other. However, the decisive battles of Gettysburg in the east and Vicksburg in the west allowed the momentum of the war to shift in favor of the Union in 1863. Increasingly, Confederate forces were outmatched by the more numerous and better equipped Union forces, whose greater population and economic resources became critical factors as the war became one of attrition. An increasingly effective naval blockade further damaged the Southern war economy.\\r\\nBy 1864, long-term Union advantages in geography, manpower, industry, finance, political organization and transportation were overwhelming the Confederacy. Grant fought a remarkable series of bloody battles with Lee in Virginia in the summer of 1864. Lee's defensive tactics resulted in higher casualties for Grant's army, but Lee lost strategically overall as he could not replace his casualties and was forced to retreat into trenches around his capital, Richmond, Virginia. Meanwhile, in the West, William Tecumseh Sherman captured Atlanta in 1864. His March to the Sea destroyed a hundred-mile-wide swath of Georgia, with little Confederate resistance. In 1865, the Confederacy collapsed after Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Courthouse.\\r\\nIn all, 2.2 million men served in the Union army; 360,000 of whom died from all causes ÿ two-thirds from disease. The Volunteer Army was demobilized in summer 1865.\\r\\nWhile the Confederacy never had enough supplies and it kept getting worse, the Union forces typically had enough food, supplies, ammunition and weapons. The Union supply system, even as it penetrated deeper into the South, maintained its efficiency. The key leader was Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs.[17][18] Union quartermasters were responsible for most of the $3 billion spent for the war. They operated out of sixteen major depots, which formed the basis of the system of procurement and supply throughout the war. As the war expanded, operation of these depots became much more complex, with an overlapping and interweaving relationship between the Army and government operated factories, private factories, and numerous middlemen. The purchase of goods and services through contracts supervised by the quartermasters accounted for most of federal military expenditures, apart from the wages of the soldiers. The quartermasters supervised their own soldiers, and cooperated closely with state officials, manufacturers and wholesalers trying to sell directly to the army; and representatives of civilian workers looking for higher pay at government factories. The complex system was closely monitored by congressmen anxious to ensure that their districts won their share of contracts.[19]\\r\\nLincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, enabled both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army.[20] About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery. Black Union soldiers were mostly used in garrison duty, but they fought in several battles, such as the Battle of the Crater (1864), and the Battle of Nashville (1865).\\r\\nThere was bad blood between Confederates and black soldiers, with no quarter given on either side. At Ft. Pillow on April 12, 1864 Confederate units under Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest went wild and massacred black soldiers attempting to surrender, which further inflamed passions.[21]\\r\\nFollowing the Civil War, the U.S. Army fought a Series Of Wars with Native Americans, who resisted U.S. expansion into the center of the continent. By the 1890s the U.S. saw itself as a potential international player. The Army played a central role in winning the SpanishÿAmerican War of 1898 and the less well known PhilippineÿAmerican War of 1899ÿ1901.\\r\\nAs settlement sped up across the West after the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, clashes with Native Americans of the Plains and southwest reached a final phase. The military's mission was to clear the land of free-roaming Indians and put them onto reservations. The stiff resistance of battle-hardened, well-armed mounted Indian warriors resulted in the Indian Wars.\\r\\nIn the Apache and Navajo Wars, Colonel Christopher \\"Kit\\" Carson forced the Mescalero Apache onto a reservation in 1862. Skirmishes between Americans and Apaches continued until after the turn of the century. In 1863ÿ1864, Carson used a scorched earth policy in the Navajo campaign, burning Navajo fields and homes, and capturing or killing their livestock. He was aided by other Indian tribes with long-standing enmity toward the Navajos, chiefly the Utes. Later in 1864, he fought a combined force of more than one thousand Kiowa, Comanche, and Plains Apache at the First Battle of Adobe Walls. Carson retreated but he managed to destroy an Indian village and winter supplies. In the Red River War which followed the U.S. army systematically destroyed Comanche property, horses, and livelihood in the Texas panhandle, resulting in the surrender of the last Comanche war chief, Quanah Parker, in June 1875.\\r\\nIn June 1877, in the Nez Perce War the Nez Perce under Chief Joseph, unwilling to give up their traditional lands and move to a reservation, undertook a 1,200 mile fighting retreat from Oregon to near the CanadaÿUS border in Montana. Numbering only 200 warriors, the Nez Perce battled some 2,000 American regulars and volunteers in a total of eighteen engagements, including four major battles and at least four fiercely contested skirmishes.\\"[22] The Nez Perce were finally surrounded at the Battle of Bear Paw and surrendered.\\r\\nThe Great Sioux War of 1876ÿ77 was conducted by the Lakota under Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. The conflict began after repeated violations of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) once gold was discovered in the hills. By far the most famous battle was the one-sided Indian victory at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, in which combined Sioux and Cheyenne forces defeated the 7th Cavalry, led by General George Armstrong Custer. The West was largely pacified by 1890, apart from small Indian raids along the Mexican border.[23]\\r\\nCombat in the Indian wars resulted in the deaths of about 4,340 people, including soldiers, civilians and Native Americans. In all the Indian wars combined from 1790 to 1910, regular cavalry units fought in about 1000 engagements and suffered more than 2000 total killed and wounded.[24] Disease and accidents caused far more Army casualties than combat; annually, eight soldiers per 1000 died from disease, and five per 1000 died from battle wounds or accidents.[25]\\r\\nIn 1910, the U.S. Signal Corps acquired and flew the Army's first aircraft, the Wright Type A biplane.[26]\\r\\nThe Maneuver Division was formed in San Antonio, Texas, in March 1911, to undertake offensive operations against Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. This was the United States' first attempt at modernizing the division concept. Major General Leonard Wood, then Army Chief of Staff, mobilized the division primarily to demonstrate to Congress that the United States was not adequately prepared for modern warfare. The division was disbanded on 7 August 1911.\\r\\nBecause of the mobilization difficulties experienced with the Maneuver Division, on 15 February 1913 a standing organization of a \\"regular army organized in divisions and cavalry brigades ready for immediate use as an expeditionary force or for other purposes...\\" and \\"an army of national citizen soldiers organized in peace in complete divisions and prepared to reenforce the Regular Army in time of war\\" was organized by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and known as the \\"Stimson Plan.\\" The continental United States was divided into four geographic departments (Eastern, Central, Western, and Southern) and a regular army division assigned to each, and 12 geographic districts, each with a national guard infantry division assigned. 32 of the 48 state governors committed their national guards to support of the plan. There were also three artillery commands: the Northern Atlantic Coast Artillery District, the Southern Atlantic Coast Artillery District, and the Pacific Coast Artillery District.[27]\\r\\nIn 1914 and 1916, U.S. troops were sent into Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. The Pancho Villa Expedition under Brigadier General John J. Pershing attempted to capture Pancho Villa, a Mexican who had mounted attacks on U.S. border towns. The skirmishes on the border later became known as the Border War (1910ÿ19).\\r\\nA combined conscript and volunteer force, the National Army, was formed by the United States War Department in 1917 to fight in World War I. The National Army was formed from the old core of the regular United States Army, augmented by units of the United States National Guard and a large draft of able-bodied men.[28]\\r\\nThe Selective Service Act established the broad outlines of the Army's structure. There were to be three increments:\\r\\nMuch of the identity of these three segments eventually would be lost as recruits and draftees alike were absorbed in all units, so that in mid-1918 the War Department would change the designation of all land forces to one \\"United States Army.\\" The original segment to which regiments, brigades, and divisions belonged nevertheless remained apparent from numerical designations. For the Regular Army, for example, divisions were numbered up to 25, while numbers 26 through 49 were reserved for the National Guard and 50 through higher numbers for divisions of the National Army.[29]\\r\\nAt its greatest size the National Army had more than six million men. Promotions within the National Army were quick, with most United States Army officers receiving double and triple promotions within a space of only two years.[disputed ÿ discuss] Dwight D. Eisenhower entered the National Army as a captain and was a lieutenant colonel one year later. Douglas MacArthur also advanced quickly in the National Army, rising from major to brigadier general in two years.\\r\\nThe Army entered World War I with very large divisions, often numbering more than 30,000 men (the 4th Division contained 32,000, for example) and consisting of two infantry brigades of two regiments each, with a total of sixteen infantry battalions per division. Each division also had three artillery regiments and an engineer regiment.[30]\\r\\nThe United States joined World War I in April 1917 on the side of the Triple Entente (British Empire, France, and Russia). Because of the necessary period of training before the units were moved overseas, the first elements of the American Expeditionary Forces arrived in June 1917. Their first actions of the Western Front came in October 1917. U.S. troops contributed to the offensive that finally broke through the German lines. With the armistice on 11 November 1918, the Army once again decreased its forces.\\r\\nThe National Army was disbanded in 1920 and all personnel not subject to demobilization who had held ranks in the National Army were reverted to Regular Army status. George S. Patton, who had been a colonel in the National Army, returned to the Regular Army as a captain. Some, such as Douglas MacArthur, maintained their wartime rank in the Regular Army. For those keeping their wartime ranks the reality was, however, that they would usually remain at that specific rank for years. This often resulted in talented officers leaving service in the interwar years.\\r\\nAfter establishing post-World War I divisions, the Army experienced a prolonged period of stagnation and deterioration. The National Defense Act of 1920 authorized a Regular Army of 296,000 men, but Congress gradually backed away from that number. As with the Regular Army, the National Guard never recruited its authorized 486,000 men, and the Organized Reserves became merely a pool of reserve officers. The root of the Army's problem was money. Congress yearly appropriated only about half the funds that the General Staff requested. Impoverished in manpower and funds, infantry and cavalry divisions dwindled to skeletal organizations.\\r\\nBetween 1923 and 1939 divisions gradually declined as fighting organizations. After Regular Army divisions moved to permanent posts, the War Department modified command relationships between divisional units and the corps areas, making division and brigade commanders responsible only for unit training. They were limited to two visits per year to their assigned elements ÿ and that only if corps area commanders made funds available. Later, as a further economy move, the War Department reduced the number of command visits to one per year, a restriction that effectively destroyed the possibility of training units as combined arms teams.\\r\\nDuring World War II, the Army of the United States was formed as a successor to the National Army. The Army of the United States operated on the same principles as its predecessor, combining Regular Army, National Guard, and conscript forces into one fighting unit. The Army of the United States also incorporated Reserve forces.\\r\\nThe Army fought World War II with more flexible divisions, consisting of three infantry regiments of three infantry battalions each. From the point of view of soldiers, most of their time was spent in training in the United States, with large numbers going overseas in 1944.[31]\\r\\nThe United States entered World War II after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. On the European front, U.S. Army troops formed a significant portion of the forces that captured North Africa and Sicily and later fought in Italy. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, and in the subsequent liberation of Europe and defeat of Nazi Germany, millions of U.S. Army troops played a central role. In the Pacific, Army soldiers participated alongside the U.S. Marine Corps in the \\"island hopping\\" campaign that wrested the Pacific Islands from Japanese control. Following the Axis surrenders in May (Germany) and August (Japan) of 1945, Army troops were deployed to Japan and Germany to occupy the two defeated nations.\\r\\nThe U.S. Army Air Force, which was an outgrowth of the earlier Army Air Corps, had been virtually independent during the war. In 1947, it separated from the Army to become the United States Air Force.\\r\\nShortly after the war, in 1948, the Women's Armed Services Integration Act gave women permanent status in the Regular and Reserve forces of the Army.[32]\\r\\nThe end of World War II set the stage for the East-West confrontation known as the Cold War. With the outbreak of the Korean War, concerns over the defense of Western Europe rose. Two corps, V and VII, were reactivated under Seventh United States Army in 1950 and American strength in Europe rose from one division to four. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops remained stationed in West Germany, with others in Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, until the 1990s in anticipation of a possible Soviet attack.\\r\\nDuring the Cold War, American troops and their allies fought Communist forces in Korea and Vietnam (see Domino Theory). The Korean War began in 1950, when the Soviets walked out of a U.N. Security Council meeting, removing their possible veto. Under a United Nations umbrella, hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops fought to prevent the takeover of South Korea by North Korea, and later, to invade the northern nation. After repeated advances and retreats by both sides, and the PRC People's Volunteer Army entry into the war, the Korean Armistice Agreement ended the war and returned the peninsula to the status quo in 1953.\\r\\nDuring the 1950s, the Pentomic reorganization shifted the basic tactical unit from the regiment to the five-company battle group. Armored divisions did not change during the Pentomic era. Instead of brigades, an armored division had three Combat Commands designated: CCA, CCB, and CCC.\\r\\nOn 16 December 1960, the Army Chief of Staff directed a reappraisal of division organization. Resulting studies were carried out between January and April 1961, and fully implemented by 1965.[33] The resulting Reorganization of Army Divisions (ROAD) program shifted all types of divisions (Mechanized, Airborne, Armor, Infantry and Cavalry) to an identical structure of three brigades of three (sometimes four) battalions. The ROAD division consisted of a mix of nine to twelve armor and infantry battalions assigned to the division to meet the expected needs of the division based on its Mission, the likely Enemy, the Terrain/weather, and other forces available or Troops (METT). Each brigade would be assigned or attached the mix of battalions and companies based on the division commanders estimate based on METT. The ROAD concept was based on the armored divisions of WWII and Korea.\\r\\nAs operations continued, the division commander could and did move battalions and companies as needed by the flow of the battle. The 1st Air Cavalry in Vietnam had nine battalions spread as needed between the three brigade headquarters, but often moved the equivalent of one battalion each day by airlift from one side of the battefield to the other. An infantry battalion in 1st Infantry Division in Vietnam could expect having the number of companies under his command change at least once a day, with companies from different divisions not uncommon. In the \\"Heavy\\" divisions in Europe, a tank or infantry company could find itself moved to other battalions more than once a week, and to another brigade as needed.\\r\\nThe Vietnam War is often regarded as a low point in the Army's record due to the extensive use of drafted enlisted personnel versus mobilization of Army Reserve and Army National Guard personnel, the unpopularity of the war with the American public, and frustrating restrictions placed on the Army by U.S. political leaders (i.e., no invasion of communist-held North Vietnam). While American forces had been stationed in the Republic of Vietnam since 1959, in intelligence and advisory/training roles, they did not deploy in large numbers until 1965, after the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. American forces effectively established and maintained control of the \\"traditional\\" battlefield, however they struggled to counter the guerrilla hit and run tactics of the communist Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army. On a tactical level, American soldiers (and the U.S. military as a whole) did not lose a sizable battle.[34] For instance in the Tet Offensive in 1968, the U.S. Army turned a large scale attack by communist forces into a massive defeat of the Viet Cong on the battlefield (though at the time the offensive sapped the political will of the American public) which permanently weakened the guerrilla force. Thereafter, most large scale engagements were fought with the regular North Vietnamese Army. In 1973 domestic political opposition to the war finally forced a U.S. withdrawal. In 1975, Vietnam was unified under a communist government.\\r\\nDuring the 1960s the Department of Defense continued to scrutinize the reserve forces and to question the number of divisions and brigades as well as the redundancy of maintaining two reserve components, the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve.[35] In 1967 Secretary of Defense McNamara decided that 15 combat divisions in the Army National Guard were unnecessary and cut the number to 8 divisions (1 mechanized infantry, 2 armored, and 5 infantry), but increased the number of brigades from 7 to 18 (1 airborne, 1 armored, 2 mechanized infantry, and 14 infantry). The loss of the divisions did not set well with the states. Their objections included the inadequate maneuver element mix for those that remained and the end to the practice of rotating divisional commands among the states that supported them. Under the proposal, the remaining division commanders were to reside in the state of the division base. No reduction, however, in total Army National Guard strength was to take place, which convinced the governors to accept the plan. The states reorganized their forces accordingly between 1 December 1967 and 1 May 1968.\\r\\nA \\"Total Force Policy\\" was adopted by Chief of Staff of the Army General Creighton Abrams in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and involved treating the three components of the Army ÿ the Regular Army, the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve as a single force.[36]\\r\\nTraining and Doctrine Command was established as a major U.S. Army command on 1 July 1973. The new command, along with the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM), was created from the Continental Army Command (CONARC) located at Fort Monroe, VA. That action was the major innovation in the Army's post-Vietnam reorganization, in the face of realization that CONARC's obligations and span of control were too broad for efficient focus. The new organization functionally realigned the major Army commands in the continental United States. CONARC, and Headquarters, U.S. Army Combat Developments Command (CDC), situated at Fort Belvoir, VA, were discontinued, with TRADOC and FORSCOM at Fort Belvoir assuming the realigned missions. TRADOC assumed the combat developments mission from CDC, took over the individual training mission formerly the responsibility of CONARC, and assumed command from CONARC of the major Army installations in the United States housing Army training center and Army branch schools. FORSCOM assumed CONARC's operational responsibility for the command and readiness of all divisions and corps in the continental U.S. and for the installations where they were based.\\r\\nThe 1980s was mostly a decade of reorganization. The Army converted to an all-volunteer force with greater emphasis on training and technology.[37] The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 created Unified Combatant Commands bringing the Army together with the other three military branches under unified, geographically organized command structures. The Army also played a role in the invasions of Grenada in 1983 (Operation Urgent Fury) and Panama in 1989 (Operation Just Cause).\\r\\nBy 1989 Germany was nearing reunification and the Cold War was coming to a close. The Army leadership reacted by starting to plan for a reduction in strength. By November 1989 Pentagon briefers were laying out plans for 'Operation Quicksilver,' a plan to reduce Army endstrength by 23%, from 750,000 to 580,000.[38] A number of incentives such as early retirement were used. In 1990 Iraq invaded its smaller neighbor, Kuwait, and U.S. land forces, led by the 82nd Airborne Division, quickly deployed to assure the protection of Saudi Arabia. In January 1991 Operation Desert Storm commenced, a U.S.-led coalition which deployed over 500,000 troops, the bulk of them from U.S. Army formations, to drive out Iraqi forces. The campaign ended in a victory for the Army, as Western coalition forces routed the Iraqi Army, organized along Soviet lines, in just one hundred hours.\\r\\nAfter Desert Storm, the Army did not see major combat operations for the remainder of the 1990s. Army units did participate in a number of peacekeeping activities, such as the UN peacekeeping mission in Somalia in 1993, where the abortive Operation Gothic Serpent led to the deaths of eighteen American soldiers and the withdrawal of international forces. The Army also contributed troops to NATO peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia from December 1995, initially with IFOR. U.S. Army forces only left Bosnia & Herzegovina in 2004 with the disestablishment of Task Force Eagle on November 24, 2004.[39] U.S. Army troops remain in Kosovo with KFOR.\\r\\nDuring the first half of the decade the Army deactivated 8 of its 18 active divisions:\\r\\nas well as two of its ten National Guard divisions:\\r\\nPlans to convert two Army National Guard divisions to cadre formations were rejected by Congress in 1992.[40]\\r\\nDuring the mid-late 1990s, the Army trialled Force XXI. One of its initiatives was Task Force 21 (also called Task Force XXI), a battlefield digitized brigade formed for the Advanced Warfighting Exercises in 1997 to test Force XXI concepts, technology, and tactics. The brigade was formed from the 4th Infantry Division (which replaced the deactivated 2d Armored Division in 1992) and the 1st Cavalry Division as early as 1992, with some field testing beginning at Fort Hood in late 1992, early 1993. The 4th Infantry Division units assigned were 3-66 Armor and 1-22 Infantry, both of the 3d Brigade, while 1st Cavalry Division drew soldiers across a variety of support and combat fields.\\r\\nTechnologies tested included Software-defined radios, Applique computers, Ground Surveillance Radar, Satellite radio email systems, and Advanced UAV technology. TF-XXI participated in various Advanced Warfighting Exercises, including WARRIOR FOCUS (1995 #4).\\r\\nOn September 11, 2001, 53 Army civilians (47 employees and six contractors) and 22 soldiers were among the 125 victims killed in the Pentagon in a terrorist attack when American Airlines Flight 77 commandeered by five Al-Qaeda hijackers slammed into the western side of the building, as part of the September 11 attacks. Lieutenant General Timothy Maude was the highest-ranking military official killed at the Pentagon, and the most senior U.S. Army officer killed by foreign action since the death of Lieutenant General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr. on June 18, 1945, in the Battle of Okinawa during World War II.\\r\\nIn response to the September 11 attacks, and as part of the Global War on Terror, U.S. and NATO combined arms (i.e. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, Special Operations) forces invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, replacing the Taliban government.\\r\\nThe Army took part in the combined U.S. and allied 2003 invasion of Iraq. Within months the mission changed from conflict between regular militaries to counterinsurgency, with large numbers of suicide attacks resulting in the deaths of more than 4,000 U.S. service members (as of March 2008) and injuries to thousands more.[41]\\r\\nMost of the units that carried out the ground campaign phase of the invasion of Iraq, and who bore the larger part of the conflict with the Iraqi military in 2003 were those of the Army. Since then, they have performed numerous operations against insurgents.\\r\\nThe Army has had to make several adjustments to address demands on its personnel and equipment. The US Army has utilized its stop-loss policy and has required more of its combat personnel to serve more tours of duty than before, due to the need for experienced personnel. As opposed to Vietnam, there was no involuntary draft of enlisted males into the Army. Instead, the service employed its Total Force model and mobilized/recalled to active duty numerous Army National Guard and Army Reserve combat arms, combat support and combat service support units and personnel, often deploying many of them repeatedly to the Southwest Asia combat zone in a manner similar to their Regular Army counterparts.\\r\\nThere are deep concerns about effects on the psychological health of US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Suicides among US soldiers have been rising, and have reached their highest rate in 26 years. This increase has coincided with US deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq.[42]\\r\\nDuring the insurgency, it was found that most Army and Marine Corps vehicles such as HMMWVs were insufficiently armored, leading to efforts to add greater armor to protect against improvised explosive devices. Some soldiers added armor by using modifications known as hillbilly armor. In the short term, HMMWVs in service in Iraq are being replaced by Category 1 MRAP vehicles, primarily the Force Protection Cougar H and the International MaxxPro.[43] The US Marine Corps plans to replace all HMMWVs patrolling \\"outside the wire\\" with MRAP vehicles.\\r\\nThe lack of stability in Iraq has led to longer deployments for Regular Army as well as Army Reserve and Army National Guard troops. U.S. troops withdrew in December 2011, but fighting continues. 3,293 US Army personnel were killed in the conflict.[44]\\r\\nThe Army's chief modernization plan was the Future Combat Systems program. Many systems were canceled and the remaining were swept into the BCT modernization program.[citation needed]","input":"When was the first standing army created in the united states?"},{"output":"difficulty","context":"Dysphagia is the medical term for the symptom of difficulty in swallowing.[1][2] Although classified under \\"symptoms and signs\\" in ICD-10,[3] the term is sometimes used as a condition in its own right.[4][5][6] People with dysphagia are sometimes unaware of having it.[7][8]\\r\\nIt may be a sensation that suggests difficulty in the passage of solids or liquids from the mouth to the stomach,[9] a lack of pharyngeal sensation, or various other inadequacies of the swallowing mechanism. Dysphagia is distinguished from other symptoms including odynophagia, which is defined as painful swallowing,[10] and globus, which is the sensation of a lump in the throat. A person can have dysphagia without odynophagia (dysfunction without pain), odynophagia without dysphagia (pain without dysfunction), or both together. A psychogenic dysphagia is known as phagophobia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome patients have limited awareness of their dysphagia, so lack of the symptom does not exclude an underlying disease.[11] When dysphagia goes undiagnosed or untreated, patients are at a high risk of pulmonary aspiration and subsequent aspiration pneumonia secondary to food or liquids going the wrong way into the lungs. Some people present with \\"silent aspiration\\" and do not cough or show outward signs of aspiration. Undiagnosed dysphagia can also result in dehydration, malnutrition, and renal failure.\\r\\nSome signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia include difficulty controlling food in the mouth, inability to control food or saliva in the mouth, difficulty initiating a swallow, coughing, choking, frequent pneumonia, unexplained weight loss, gurgly or wet voice after swallowing, nasal regurgitation, and dysphagia (patient complaint of swallowing difficulty).[11] When asked where the food is getting stuck, patients will often point to the cervical (neck) region as the site of the obstruction. The actual site of obstruction is always at or below the level at which the level of obstruction is perceived.\\r\\nThe most common symptom of esophageal dysphagia is the inability to swallow solid food, which the patient will describe as 'becoming stuck' or 'held up' before it either passes into the stomach or is regurgitated. Pain on swallowing or odynophagia is a distinctive symptom that can be highly indicative of carcinoma, although it also has numerous other causes that are not related to cancer.\\r\\nAchalasia is a major exception to usual pattern of dysphagia in that swallowing of fluid tends to cause more difficulty than swallowing solids. In achalasia, there is idiopathic destruction of parasympathetic ganglia of the Auerbach's (Myenteric) plexus of the entire esophagus, which results in functional narrowing of the lower esophagus, and peristaltic failure throughout its length.\\r\\nComplications of dysphagia may include aspiration, pneumonia, dehydration, and weight loss.\\r\\nDysphagia is classified into the following major types:[12]\\r\\nFollowing table enumerates possible causes of dysphagia:\\r\\nThe gold-standard for diagnosing oropharyngeal dysphagia in countries of the Commonwealth are via a modified barium swallow study or videofluoroscopic swallow study (fluoroscopy). This is a lateral video (and AP in some cases) X-ray that provides objective information on bolus transport, safest consistency of bolus (different consistencies including honey, nectar, thin, pudding, puree, regular), and possible head positioning and/or maneuvers that may facilitate swallow function depending on each individual's anatomy and physiology. In Zenker's diverticulum, barium meal first fills the pouch, then overflows from top. In achalasia, it shows \\"bird-beak\\" tapering of distal esophagus, this is also discirbed as a \\" rat's tail\\" appearance. Reflux can be demonstrated in fluorscopy. In strictures, meal is initially arrested above stricture, then gradually trickles down.\\r\\nAll causes of dysphagia are considered as differential diagnoses. Some common ones are:\\r\\nEsophageal dysphagia is almost always caused by disease in or adjacent to the esophagus but occasionally the lesion is in the pharynx or stomach. In many of the pathological conditions causing dysphagia, the lumen becomes progressively narrowed and indistensible. Initially only fibrous solids cause difficulty but later the problem can extend to all solids and later even to liquids. Patients with difficulty swallowing may benefit from thickened fluids if the person is more comfortable with those liquids, although, so far, there are no scientific study that proves that those thickened liquids are beneficial.\\r\\nDysphagia may manifest as the result of autonomic nervous system pathologies including stroke[14] and ALS,[15] or due to rapid iatrogenic correction of an electrolyte imbalance.[16]\\r\\nThere are many ways to treat dysphagia, such as swallowing therapy, dietary changes, feeding tubes, certain medications, and surgery. Treatments for dysphagia will be managed by a group of specialists known as a multidisciplinary team.\\r\\nMinitablets make medications easier to swallow.[17]\\r\\nSwallowing disorders can occur in all age groups, resulting from congenital abnormalities, structural damage, and/or medical conditions.[11] Swallowing problems are a common complaint among older individuals, and the incidence of dysphagia is higher in the elderly,[18][19] in patients who have had strokes,[20] and in patients who are admitted to acute care hospitals or chronic care facilities. Dysphagia is a symptom of many different causes, which can usually be elicited through a careful history by the treating physician. A formal oropharyngeal dysphagia evaluation is performed by a medical speech pathologist or occupational therapist.[21]\\r\\nThe word \\"dysphagia\\" is derived from the Greek dys meaning bad or disordered, and the root phag- meaning \\"eat\\".","input":"What is the difference between dysphagia and odynophagia?"},{"output":"10 November 1775","context":"","input":"When was the u s marine corps established?"},{"output":"fifty","context":"The Bayeux Tapestry (UK: /ba??j??r/, US: /b??ju?, be?-/; French: Tapisserie de Bayeux, IPA:?[tapis?i d? baj?], or La telle du conquest; Latin: Tapete Baiocense) is an embroidered cloth nearly 70 metres (230?ft) long and 50 centimetres (20?in) tall,[1][2][3] which depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England concerning William, Duke of Normandy, and Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England, and culminating in the Battle of Hastings. It is thought to date to the 11th century, within a few years after the battle. It tells the story from the point of view of the conquering Normans.\\r\\nAccording to Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, in her 2005 book La Tapisserie de Bayeux:\\r\\nThe Bayeux tapestry is one of the supreme achievements of the Norman Romanesque?.... Its survival almost intact over nine centuries is little short of miraculous?... Its exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit combine to make it endlessly fascinating.[4]\\r\\nThe tapestry consists of some fifty scenes with Latin tituli, embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns. It is likely that it was commissioned by Bishop Odo, William's half-brother, and made in Englandnot Bayeuxin the 1070s. In 1729 the hanging was rediscovered by scholars at a time when it was being displayed annually in Bayeux Cathedral. The tapestry is now exhibited at the Muse de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in Bayeux, Normandy, France (491628N 04201W? / ?49.2744N 0.7003W? / 49.2744; -0.7003).\\r\\nThe designs on the Bayeux Tapestry are embroidered rather than woven, so that it is not technically a tapestry.[5] Nevertheless, it has always been referred to as a tapestry until recent years, when the name \\"Bayeux Embroidery\\" has gained ground among certain art historians. The tapestry can be seen as a perfect example of secular Norman art. Tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in Medieval western Europe, though at 0.5 by 68.38 metres (1.6 by 224.3?ft, and apparently incomplete) the Bayeux Tapestry is exceptionally large. Only the figures and decoration are embroidered, on a background left plain, which shows the subject very clearly and was necessary to cover large areas.\\r\\nOn 18 January 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that the Bayeux Tapestry would be loaned to Britain for public display. It is expected to be exhibited at the British Museum in London from 2022. It will be the first time that the Tapestry has left France in 950 years.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known written reference to the tapestry is a 1476 inventory of Bayeux Cathedral,[7] but its origins have been the subject of much speculation and controversy.\\r\\nFrench legend maintained the tapestry was commissioned and created by Queen Matilda, William the Conqueror's wife, and her ladies-in-waiting. Indeed, in France it is occasionally known as \\"La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde\\" (Tapestry of Queen Matilda). However, scholarly analysis[8] in the 20th century concluded it was probably commissioned by William's half-brother, Bishop Odo, who, after the Conquest, became Earl of Kent and, when William was absent in Normandy, regent of England.\\r\\nThe reasons for the Odo commission theory include: 1) three of the bishop's followers mentioned in the Domesday Book appear on the tapestry; 2) it was found in Bayeux Cathedral, built by Odo; and 3) it may have been commissioned at the same time as the cathedral's construction in the 1070s, possibly completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral's dedication.\\r\\nAssuming Odo commissioned the tapestry, it was probably designed and constructed in England by Anglo-Saxon artists (Odo's main power base being by then in Kent); the Latin text contains hints of Anglo-Saxon; other embroideries originate from England at this time; and the vegetable dyes can be found in cloth traditionally woven there.[9][10][11] Howard B. Clarke has proposed that the designer of the tapestry was Scolland, the abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, because of his previous position as head of the scriptorium at Mont Saint-Michel (famed for its illumination), his travels to Trajan's Column, and his connections to Wadard and Vital, two individuals identified in the tapestry.[12][13] The actual physical work of stitching was most likely undertaken by female needle workers. Anglo-Saxon needlework of the more detailed type known as Opus Anglicanum was famous across Europe. It was perhaps commissioned for display in the hall of his palace and then bequeathed to the cathedral he built, following the pattern of the documented but lost hanging of Byrhtnoth.[14]\\r\\nAlternative theories exist. Carola Hicks has suggested it could possibly have been commissioned by Edith of Wessex.[15] Wolfgang Grape has challenged the consensus that the embroidery is Anglo-Saxon, distinguishing between Anglo-Saxon and other Northern European techniques;[16] Medieval material authority Elizabeth Coatsworth[17] contradicted this: \\"The attempt to distinguish Anglo-Saxon from other Northern European embroideries before 1100 on the grounds of technique cannot be upheld on the basis of present knowledge.\\"[18] George Beech suggests the tapestry was executed at the Abbey of St. Florent in the Loire Valley, and says the detailed depiction of the Breton campaign argues for additional sources in France.[19] Andrew Bridgeford has suggested that the tapestry was actually of English design and encoded with secret messages meant to undermine Norman rule.[20]\\r\\nIn common with other embroidered hangings of the early medieval period, this piece is conventionally referred to as a \\"tapestry\\", although it is not a true tapestry in which the design is woven into the cloth; it is in fact an embroidery.\\r\\nThe Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in crewel (wool yarn) on a tabby-woven linen ground 68.38 metres long and 0.5 metres wide (224.3?ft G?1.6?ft) and using two methods of stitching: outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures.[10][11] Nine linen panels, between fourteen and three metres in length, were sewn together after each was embroidered and the joins were disguised with subsequent embroidery.[21] At the first join (start of scene 14) the borders do not line up properly but the technique was improved so that the later joins are practically invisible.[21] The design involved a broad central zone with narrow decorative borders top and bottom.[21] By inspecting the woollen threads behind the linen it is apparent all these aspects were embroidered together at a session and the awkward placing of the tituli is not due to them being added later.[21] Later generations have patched the hanging in numerous places and some of the embroidery (especially in the final scene) has been reworked.[21] The tapestry may well have maintained much of its original appearanceit now compares closely with a careful drawing made in 1730.[21]\\r\\nThe main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green. Later repairs are worked in light yellow, orange, and light greens.[10] Laid yarns are couched in place with yarn of the same or contrasting colour.\\r\\nThe tapestry's central zone contains most of the action, which sometimes overflows into the borders either for dramatic effect or because depictions would otherwise be very cramped (for example at Edward's death scene). Events take place in a long series of scenes which are generally separated by highly stylised trees. However, the trees are not placed consistently and the greatest scene shift, between Harold's audience with Edward after his return to England and Edward's burial scene, is not marked in any way at all.[22]\\r\\nThe tituli are normally in the central zone but occasionally use the top border. The borders are otherwise mostly purely decorative and only sometimes does the decoration complement the action in the central zone. The decoration consists of birds, beasts, fish and scenes from fables, agriculture and hunting. There are frequent oblique bands separating the vignettes. There are nude figures, some of corpses from battle, others of a ribald nature.[22] A harrow, a newly invented implement, is depicted (scene 10) and this is the earliest known depiction. The picture of Halley's Comet, which appears in the upper border (scene 32), is the first known picture of this comet.[22]\\r\\nThe end of the tapestry has been missing from time immemorial and the final titulus \\"Et fuga verterunt Angli\\" (\\"and the English left fleeing\\") is said to be \\"entirely spurious\\", added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment.[22] Musset speculates the hanging was originally about 1.5 metres longer.[22] At the last section still remaining the embroidery has been almost completely restored but this seems to have been done with at least some regard to the original stitching.[22] The stylised tree is quite unlike any other tree in the tapestry.[22] The start of the tapestry has also been restored but to a much lesser extent.[22]\\r\\nIn 1724 a linen backing cloth was sewn on comparatively crudely and, in around the year 1800, large ink numerals were written on the backing which broadly enumerate each scene and which are still commonly used for reference.[22]\\r\\nIn a series of pictures supported by a written commentary the tapestry tells the story of the events of 1064ÿ1066 culminating in the Battle of Hastings. The two main protagonists are Harold Godwinson, recently crowned King of England, leading the Anglo-Saxon English, and William, Duke of Normandy, leading a mainly Norman army, sometimes called the companions of William the Conqueror.[22]\\r\\nWilliam was the illegitimate son of Robert the Magnificent, Duke of Normandy, and Herleva (or Arlette), a tanner's daughter. William became Duke of Normandy at the age of seven and was in control of Normandy by the age of nineteen. His half brother was Bishop Odo of Bayeux.\\r\\nKing Edward the Confessor, king of England and about sixty years old at the time the tapestry starts its narration, had no children or any clear successor. Edward's mother, Emma of Normandy, was William's great aunt. At that time succession to the English throne was not by primogeniture but was decided jointly by the king and by an assembly of nobility, the Witenagemot.\\r\\nHarold Godwinson, earl of Wessex and the most powerful noble in England, was Edward's brother-in-law. The Norman chronicler William of Poitiers[23] reported that Edward had previously determined that William would succeed him on the throne, and Harold had sworn to honour this, and yet later that Harold had claimed Edward, on his deathbed, had made him heir over William. However, other sources dispute this claim.\\r\\nThe tapestry begins with a panel of Edward the Confessor sending Harold to Normandy.(scene 1) Later Norman sources say that the mission was for Harold to pledge loyalty to William but the tapestry does not suggest any specific purpose.[21] By mischance, Harold arrives at the wrong location in France and is taken prisoner by Guy, Count of Ponthieu.(scene 7) After exchanges of messages borne by mounted messengers, Harold is released to William who then invites Harold to accompany him on a campaign against Conan II, Duke of Brittany. On the way, just outside the monastery of Mont Saint-Michel, the army become mired in quicksand and Harold saves two Norman soldiers.(scene 17) William's army chases Conan from Dol de Bretagne to Rennes, and Conan finally surrenders at Dinan.(scene 20) William gives Harold arms and armour (possibly knighting him) and Harold takes an oath on saintly relics.(scene 23) Although the writing on the tapestry explicitly states an oath is taken there is no clue as to what is being promised.[21]\\r\\nHarold leaves for home and meets again with the old king Edward, who appears to be remonstrating with him.(scene 25) Harold is in a somewhat submissive posture and seems to be in disgrace.[21] However, possibly deliberately, the king's intentions are not made clear.[21] The scene then shifts by about one year to when Edward has become mortally ill and the tapestry strongly suggests that, on his deathbed, he bequeaths the crown to Harold.[note 1][22] What is probably the coronation ceremony[note 2] is attended by Stigand, whose position as Archbishop of Canterbury was controversial.[22](scene 31) Stigand is performing a liturgical function, possibly not the crowning itself.[22] The tapestry labels the celebrant as \\"Stigant Archieps\\" (Stigand the archbishop) although by that time he had been excommunicated by the papacy who considered his appointment unlawful.[21]\\r\\nA star with a streaming tail? probably Halley's Comet)? then appears.[note 3] At this point the lower border of the tapestry shows a fleet of ghost-like ships thus hinting at a future invasion.[21](scene 33) The news of Harold's coronation is taken to Normandy, whereupon we are told that William is ordering a fleet of ships to be built although it is Bishop Odo shown issuing the instructions.(scene 35) The invaders reach England, and land unopposed. William orders his men to find food, and a meal is cooked.(scene 43) A house is burnt by two soldiers, which may indicate some ravaging of the local countryside on the part of the invaders, and underneath, on a smaller scale than the arsonists, a woman holds her boy's hand as she asks for humanity.(scene 47) News is brought to William.[note 4] The Normans build a motte and bailey at Hastings to defend their position. Messengers are sent between the two armies, and William makes a speech to prepare his army for battle.(scene 51)\\r\\nThe Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 less than three weeks after the Battle of Stamford Bridge but the tapestry does not provide this context. The English fight on foot behind a shield wall, whilst the Normans are on horses.[note 5] Two fallen knights are named as Leofwine and Gyrth, Harold's brothers, but both armies are shown fighting bravely.[21] Bishop Odo brandishes his baton or mace and rallies the Norman troops in battle.(scene 54)[note 6][21] To reassure his knights that he is still alive and well, William raises his helmet to show his face.[22] The battle becomes very bloody with troops being slaughtered and dismembered corpses littering the ground. King Harold is killed.(scene 57) This scene can be interpreted in different ways, as the name \\"Harold\\" appears above a number of knights, making it difficult to identify which character is Harold, since one character appears with an arrow shot in his head under the name \\"Harold\\" while another character is slain by a sword underneath the words \\"he is slain\\". The final remaining scene shows unarmoured English troops fleeing the battlefield. The last part of the tapestry is missing but it is thought that the story contained only one additional scene.[21]\\r\\nTituli are included in many scenes to point out names of people and places or to explain briefly the event being depicted.[22] The text is in Latin but at times the style of words and spelling shows an English influence.[22] A dark blue wool, almost black, is mostly used but towards the end of the tapestry other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter.[22] The complete text and English translation are displayed beside images of each scene at Bayeux Tapestry tituli.\\r\\nThe first reference to the tapestry is from 1476 when it was listed in an inventory of the treasures of Bayeux Cathedral. It survived the sack of Bayeux by the Huguenots in 1562; and the next certain reference is from 1724.[22] Antoine Lancelot sent a report to the Acadmie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres concerning a sketch he had received about a work concerning William the Conqueror. He had no idea where or what the original was, although he suggested it could have been a tapestry.[24] Despite further enquiries he discovered no more.\\r\\nThe Benedictine scholar Bernard de Montfaucon made more successful investigations and found that the sketch was of a small portion of a tapestry preserved at Bayeux Cathedral. In 1729 and 1730 he published drawings and a detailed description of the complete work in the first two volumes of his Les Monuments de la Monarchie fran?aise. The drawings were by Antoine Beno?t, one of the ablest draughtsmen of that time.[24]\\r\\nThe tapestry was first briefly noted in English in 1743 by William Stukeley, in his Palaeographia Britannica.[25] The first detailed account in English was written by Smart Lethieullier, who was living in Paris in 1732ÿ3, and was acquainted with Lancelot and de Montfaucon: it was not published, however, until 1767, as an appendix to Andrew Ducarel's Anglo-Norman Antiquities.[26]\\r\\nDuring the French Revolution, in 1792, the tapestry was confiscated as public property to be used for covering military wagons.[22] It was rescued from a wagon by a local lawyer who stored it in his house until the troubles were over, whereupon he sent it to the city administrators for safekeeping.[24] After the Terror the Fine Arts Commission, set up to safeguard national treasures in 1803, required it to be removed to Paris for display at the Muse Napolon.[24] When Napoleon abandoned his planned invasion of Britain the tapestry's propaganda value was lost and it was returned to Bayeux where the council displayed it on a winding apparatus of two cylinders.[24] Despite scholars' concern that the tapestry was becoming damaged the council refused to return it to the Cathedral.[24]\\r\\nIn 1816 the Society of Antiquaries of London commissioned its historical draughtsman, Charles Stothard, to visit Bayeux to make an accurate hand-coloured facsimile of the tapestry. His drawings were subsequently engraved by James Basire jr. and published by the Society in 1819ÿ23.[27] Stothard's images are still of value as a record of the tapestry as it was before 19th-century restoration.\\r\\nBy 1842 the tapestry was displayed in a special-purpose room in the Bibliothque Publique. It required special storage in 1870 with the threatened invasion of Normandy in the Franco-Prussian War and again in 1939ÿ1944 by the Ahnenerbe during the German Occupation of France and the Normandy landings. On 27 June 1944 the Gestapo took the tapestry to the Louvre and on 18 August, three days before the Wehrmacht withdrew from Paris, Himmler sent a message (intercepted by Bletchley Park) ordering it to be taken to \\"a place of safety\\", thought to be Berlin.[21] It was only on 22 August that the SS attempted to take possession of the tapestry by which time the Louvre was again in French hands.[21] After the liberation of Paris, on 25 August, the tapestry was again put on public display in the Louvre, and in 1945 it was returned to Bayeux[24] where it is exhibited at the Muse de la Tapisserie de Bayeux.\\r\\nThe inventory listing of 1476 shows that the tapestry was being hung annually in Bayeux Cathedral for the week of the Feast of St. John the Baptist; and this was still the case in 1728, although by that time the purpose was merely to air the hanging, which was otherwise stored in a chest.[21] Clearly, the work was being well cared for. In the eighteenth century the artistry was regarded as crude or even barbarousred and yellow multi-coloured horses upset some critics. It was thought to be unfinished because the linen was not covered with embroidery.[21] However, its exhibition in the Louvre in 1797 caused a sensation, with Le Moniteur, which normally dealt with foreign affairs, reporting on it on its first two pages.[21] It inspired a popular musical, La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde. It was because the tapestry was regarded as an antiquity rather than a work of art that in 1804 it was returned to Bayeux, where in 1823 one commentator, A. L. Lchaud d'Anisy, reported that \\"there is a sort of purity in its primitive forms, especially considering the state of the arts in the eleventh century\\".[21]\\r\\nThe tapestry was becoming a tourist attraction, with Robert Southey complaining of the need to queue to see the work.[note 7] In the 1843 Hand-book for Travellers in France by John Murray III, a visit was included on \\"Recommended Route 26 (Caen to Cherbourg via Bayeux)\\", and this guidebook led John Ruskin to go there; he would describe the tapestry as \\"the most interesting thing in its way conceivable\\". Charles Dickens, however, was not impressed: \\"It is certainly the work of amateurs; very feeble amateurs at the beginning and very heedless some of them too.\\"[21]\\r\\nDuring the Second World War Heinrich Himmler coveted the work, regarding it as \\"important for our glorious and cultured Germanic history\\".[21]\\r\\nThe depiction of events on the tapestry raises several mysteries:\\r\\nThe Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by the House of Normandy and essentially depicts a Norman viewpoint. However, Harold is shown as brave and his soldiers are not belittled. Throughout, William is described as \\"dux\\" (duke) whereas Harold, also called dux up to his coronation, is subsequently called \\"rex\\" (king).[21] The fact that the narrative extensively covers Harold's activities in Normandy (in 1064) indicates that the intention was to show a strong relationship between that expedition and the Norman Conquest starting two years later. It is for this reason that the tapestry is generally seen by modern scholars as an apologia for the Norman Conquest.\\r\\nThe tapestry's narration seems to place stress on Harold's oath to William although its rationale is not made clear.[22] Norman sources claimed that the English succession was being pledged to William but English sources gave varied accounts.[22] Today it is thought the Norman sources are to be preferred.[30] Both the tapestry and Norman sources[31] named Stigand, the excommunicated Archbishop of Canterbury, as the man who crowned Harold, possibly to discredit Harold's kingship; English sources[32] suggested that he was crowned by Ealdred, Archbishop of York and favoured by the papacy, making Harold's position as legitimate king more secure. Contemporary scholarship has not decided the matter although it is generally thought Ealdred performed the coronation.[33][34]\\r\\nWhile political propaganda or personal emphasis may have somewhat distorted the historical accuracy of the story, the Bayeux tapestry presents a unique visual document of medieval arms, apparel, and other objects unlike any other artifact surviving from this period. There is no attempt at continuity between scenes either for individuals' appearance or clothing. The knights carry shields, but show no system of hereditary coats of armsthe beginnings of modern heraldic structure were in place, but would not become standard until the middle of the 12th century.[22] It has been noted that the warriors are depicted fighting with bare hands, while other sources indicate the general use of gloves in battle and hunt.\\r\\nTapestry fragments have been found in Scandinavia dating from the ninth century and it is thought that Norman and Anglo-Saxon embroidery developed from this sort of work. Examples are to be found in the grave goods of the Oseberg ship and the ?verhogdal tapestries.[22]\\r\\nA monastic text from Ely, the Liber Eliensis, mentions a woven narrative wall-hanging commemorating the deeds of Byrhtnoth, killed in 991. Wall-hangings were common by the tenth century with English and Norman texts particularly commending the skill of Anglo-Saxon seamstresses. Mural paintings imitating draperies still exist in France and Italy and there are twelfth century mentions of other wall-hangings in Normandy and France. A poem by Baldric of Dol might even describe the Bayeux Tapestry itself.[22] The Bayeux Tapestry was therefore not unique at the time it was created: rather it is remarkable for being the sole surviving example of medieval narrative needlework.[35]\\r\\nThere are a number of replicas of the Bayeux Tapestry in existence. Through the collaboration of William Morris with textile manufacturer Thomas Wardle, Wardle's wife Elizabeth, who was an accomplished seamstress, embarked on creating a reproduction in 1885.[21] She organised some 37 women in her Leek School of Art Embroidery[note 8] to collaborate working from a full-scale water-colour facsimile drawing provided by the South Kensington Museum. The full-size replica was finished in 1886 and is now exhibited in the Museum of Reading in Reading, Berkshire, England.[36] The naked figure in the original tapestry (in the border below the ?lfgyva figure) is depicted wearing a brief garment because the drawing which was worked from was similarly bowdlerised.[21]\\r\\nRay Dugan of University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, completed a stitched replica in 1996.[37] Since its completion, it has been displayed in various museums and galleries in Canada and the United States.[38]\\r\\nIn 2000, the Danish-based Bayeux Group, part of the Viking Group Lindholm H?je, began making an accurate replica of the Bayeux Tapestry, using the original sewing techniques.[39] The replica was completed in June 2014 and went on permanent exhibition at B?rglum Abbey in May 2015.[40]\\r\\nDr. E. D. Wheeler, former judge and former dean at Oglethorpe University, commissioned a hand-painted, full-size replica of the Bayeux Tapestry and donated it to the University of West Georgia in Carrollton in 1994. In 2014, the replica was acquired by the University of North Georgia in Dahlonega.\\r\\nAn approximately half scale mosaic version of the Bayeux Tapestry was formerly on display at Geraldine, New Zealand.[41] It was made up of 1.5 million 7?mm2 pieces of spring steel ÿ off-cuts from patterning disks of knitting machines ÿ and was created by Michael Linton over a period of twenty years from 1979. The work was in 32 sections, and included a hypothetical reconstruction of the missing final section leading up to William the Conqueror's coronation at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day, 1066.[42]\\r\\nJason Welch, a woodcarver from North Creake, Norfolk, England, created a replica of the Tapestry between 2011 and 2014 in carved and painted wooden relief on 25 five-foot planks. He undertook the project to help cope with the grief of losing his 16-year-old son.[43]\\r\\nOther modern artists have attempted to complete the work by creating panels depicting subsequent events up to William's coronation, though the actual content of the missing panels is unknown. In 1997, the embroidery artist Jan Messent completed a reconstruction showing William accepting the surrender of English nobles at Berkhamsted (Beorcham), Hertfordshire, and his coronation.[44][45][46] In early 2013, 416 residents of Alderney in the Channel Islands finished a continuation including William's coronation and the building of the Tower of London.[47]\\r\\nBecause it resembles a modern comic strip or movie storyboard, is widely recognised, and is so distinctive in its artistic style, the Bayeux Tapestry has frequently been used or reimagined in a variety of different popular culture contexts. George Wingfield Digby wrote in 1957:\\r\\nIt was designed to tell a story to a largely illiterate public; it is like a strip cartoon, racy, emphatic, colourful, with a good deal of blood and thunder and some ribaldry.[48]\\r\\nIt has been cited by Scott McCloud in Understanding Comics as an example of early narrative art;[49] and Bryan Talbot, a British comic book artist, has called it \\"the first known British comic strip\\".[50]\\r\\nIt has inspired many modern political and other cartoons, including:\\r\\nThe tapestry has also inspired modern embroideries, notably:\\r\\nA number of films have used sections of the tapestry in their opening credits or closing titles, including Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Anthony Mann's El Cid, Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet, Frank Cassenti's La Chanson de Roland, Kevin Reynolds' Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and Richard Fleischer's The Vikings.[54]\\r\\nThe design and embroidery of the tapestry form one of the narrative strands of Marta Morazzoni's 1988 novella The Invention of Truth.\\r\\nThe tapestry is referenced in Tony Kushner's play Angels in America. The apocryphal account of Queen Matilda's creation of the tapestry is used, perhaps in order to demonstrate that Louis, one of the main characters, holds himself to mythological standards.[55]\\r\\nThe Ulster Museum in Northern Ireland currently hosts a Game of Thrones tapestry inspired by the Bayeux tapestry, depicting the events of the television show.","input":"How many scenes are on the bayeux tapestry?"},{"output":"the right of women to vote in elections","context":"","input":"What do you mean by women's suffrage?"},{"output":"September 30, 1998.","context":"Pokmon (Japanese: ̸ƹ, Hepburn: Pokemon, Japanese:?[pokemo?]; English: /?po?k??m?n, -ki-, -ke?-/)[1][2][3] is a media franchise managed by The Pokmon Company, a Japanese consortium between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.[4] The franchise copyright is shared by all three companies, but Nintendo is the sole owner of the trademark.[5] The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995,[6] and is centered on fictional creatures called \\"Pokmon\\", which humans, known as Pokmon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport.\\r\\nThe franchise began as a pair of video games for the original Game Boy that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo. It now spans video games, trading card games, animated television shows and movies, comic books, and toys. Pokmon is the second best-selling video game franchise, behind only Nintendo's Mario franchise[7] and the highest-grossing media franchise of all time. The franchise is also represented in other Nintendo media, such as the Super Smash Bros. series.\\r\\nCumulative sales of the video games (including home console games, such as Hey You, Pikachu! for the Nintendo 64) have reached more than 290 million copies.[8] In November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment, which had managed the non-game related licensing of Pokmon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the Pokmon representation agreement. The Pokmon Company International (formerly Pokmon USA Inc.), a subsidiary of Japan's Pokmon Co., oversees all Pokmon licensing outside Asia.[9] As of March 2017, the Pokmon franchise has grossed revenues of 6.0?trillion worldwide[8] (equivalent to US$55.15?billion).\\r\\nThe franchise celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2006.[10] 2016 marks the 20th anniversary of the release of the original games, with the company celebrating by airing an ad during Super Bowl 50, issuing re-releases of Pokmon Red, Blue, and Yellow, and completely redesigning the way the newest games are played.[11][12] The mobile augmented reality game Pokmon Go was released in July 2016.[13] The first seventh-generation games Pokmon Sun and Moon were released worldwide on November 18, 2016.[14] A live-action film adaptation based on Great Detective Pikachu began production in 2017.[15] The English slogan for the franchise is \\"Gotta Catch 'Em All\\".[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Pokmon is the romanized contraction of the Japanese brand Pocket Monsters (̸ƹ, Poketto Monsut).[18] The term Pokmon, in addition to referring to the Pokmon franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 805 fictional species that have made appearances in Pokmon media as of the release of the seventh generation titles Pokmon Sun and Moon. \\"Pokmon\\" is identical in both the singular and plural, as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say \\"one Pokmon\\" and \\"many Pokmon\\", as well as \\"one Pikachu\\" and \\"many Pikachu\\".[19]\\r\\nTajiri first thought of Pokmon, albeit with a different concept and name, around 1989, when the Game Boy was first released. The concept of the Pokmon universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of Pokmon, stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Pokmon executive director Satoshi Tajiri enjoyed as a child.[20] Players are designated as Pokmon Trainers and have three general goals: to complete the regional Pokdex by collecting all of the available Pokmon species found in the fictional region where a game takes place, to complete the national Pokdex by transferring Pokmon from other regions, and to train a team of powerful Pokmon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers so they may eventually win the Pokmon League and become the regional Champion. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the Pokmon franchise, including the video games, the anime and manga series, and the Pokmon Trading Card Game.\\r\\nIn most incarnations of the Pokmon universe, a Trainer who encounters a wild Pokmon is able to capture that Pokmon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a Pok Ball at it. If the Pokmon is unable to escape the confines of the Pok Ball, it is officially considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pokmon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pokmon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokmon; if the opposing Pokmon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokmon with a Pok Ball, increasing his or her collection of creatures. Pokmon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain side games. If a Pokmon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (\\"faints\\"), the winning Pokmon gains experience points and may level up. When leveling up, the Pokmon's battling aptitude statistics (\\"stats, such as Attack and Speed\\") increase. At certain levels, the Pokmon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pokmon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pokmon, a process called evolution.\\r\\nIn the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to raise a team of Pokmon to defeat many non-player character (NPC) Trainers and their Pokmon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the Pokmon world for the Trainer to journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way (including foiling the plans of an 'evil' team of Pokmon Trainers who serve as antagonists to the player). Each game (excluding Sun and Moon) features eight especially powerful Trainers, referred to as Gym Leaders, that the Trainer must defeat in order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer receives a Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, that Trainer is eligible to challenge the region's Pokmon League, where four immensely talented trainers (referred to collectively as the \\"Elite Four\\") challenge the Trainer to four Pokmon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, he or she must then challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this last battle becomes the new champion.\\r\\nIn Sun and Moon, however, the Gym Leaders are not present, and are instead replaced with \\"Trial Captains\\", a NPC who gives the Trainer a challenge to complete so as to earn a special item. Once the player completes all of these on an island, the Trainer must take on the Island Kahuna, the strongest Trainer on the island. Once the player beats all the Kahunas, he must travel to the recently built Pokmon League, where he must re-defeat two of the Kahunas and two strong Trainers, who now form the Elite Four, and then defend his newly received title against challengers.\\r\\nIt is implied by Takeshi Shudo, the initial writer for the anime, that the creators of Pokmon had not anticipated the franchise would become so popular, and there were plans to end the series by the Gold and Silver era. In his blog, Shudo reveals he even had an ending drafted for the anime, in which the last episode reveals an elderly Ash Ketchum hallucinated the entire events of the show.[21] This is supported in an interview with president of The Pokmon Company, Tsunekazu Ishihara, who predicted the anime would end by 1998. He also stated he initially did not intend on making \\"any more Pokmon titles\\" after Gold and Silver and would have moved on to other projects. However the games' success following their release prompted Ishinhara to continue work on the series.[22]\\r\\nThe original Pokmon games were role-playing games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. These RPGs, and their sequels, remakes, and English language translations, are still considered the \\"main\\" Pokmon games, and the games which most fans of the series are referring to when they use the term \\"Pokmon games\\". All of the licensed Pokmon properties overseen by The Pokmon Company International are divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly chronological divisions by release; every several years, when an official sequel in the main RPG series is released that features new Pokmon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. The main games and their spin-offs, the anime, manga, and trading card game are all updated with the new Pokmon properties each time a new generation begins. The franchise began the seventh generation on November 18, 2016.\\r\\nThe Pokmon franchise started off in its first generation with its initial release of Pocket Monsters Aka and Midori (\\"Red\\" and \\"Green\\", respectively) for the Game Boy in Japan on February 27, 1996. When these games proved extremely popular, an enhanced Ao (\\"Blue\\") version was released sometime after, and the Ao version was reprogrammed as Pokmon Red and Blue for international release. The games launched in the United States on September 30, 1998. The original Aka and Midori versions were never released outside Japan.[24] Afterwards, a further enhanced version titled Pokmon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition was released to partially take advantage of the color palette of the Game Boy Color, as well as to feature more elements from the popular Pokmon anime. This first generation of games introduced the original 151 species of Pokmon, in National Pokdex order, encompassing all Pokmon from Bulbasaur to Mew. It also introduced the basic game concepts of capturing, training, battling, and trading Pokmon with both computer and human players. These versions of the games take place within the fictional Kanto region, inspired by the real world Kant region of Japan, though the name \\"Kanto\\" was not used until the second generation.\\r\\nThe second generation of Pokmon began in 1999 with the release of Pokmon Gold and Silver for Game Boy Color. Like the previous generation, an enhanced version titled Pokmon Crystal was later released. The second generation introduced 100 new species of Pokmon, starting with Chikorita and ending with Celebi. The Pokdex totaled 251 Pokmon to collect, train, and battle, set in Johto, inspired by Japan's Kansai region. The Pokmon mini is a handheld game console released in November 2001 in North America, December 2001 in Japan, and 2002 in Europe.\\r\\nPokmon entered its third generation with the 2002 release of Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire for Game Boy Advance and continued with the Game Boy Advance remakes of Pokmon Red and Blue, Pokmon FireRed and LeafGreen, and an enhanced version of Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire titled Pokmon Emerald. The third generation introduced 135 new Pokmon, starting with Treecko and ending with Deoxys, for a total of 386 species. Pokmon Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald are set in Hoenn, inspired by Japan's Kyushu region. However, this generation also garnered some criticism for leaving out several gameplay features, including the day-and-night system introduced in the previous generation. It was also the first installment that encouraged the player to collect merely a selected assortment of the total number of Pokmon rather than every existing species. By contrast, 202 out of 386 species are catchable in the Ruby and Sapphire versions.\\r\\nIn 2006, Japan began the fourth generation of the franchise with the release of Pokmon Diamond and Pearl for Nintendo DS. The fourth generation introduced another 107 new species of Pokmon, starting with Turtwig and ending with Arceus, bringing the total of Pokmon species to 493.[25] The Nintendo DS \\"touch screen\\" allows new features to the game such as cooking poffins with the stylus and using the \\"Poktch\\". New gameplay concepts include a restructured move-classification system, online multiplayer trading and battling via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, the return and expansion of the second generation's day-and-night system, the expansion of the third generation's Pokmon Contests into \\"Super Contests\\", and the new region of Sinnoh. This region was inspired by Japan's Hokkaido region and part of Russia's Sakhalin, and has an underground component for multiplayer gameplay in addition to the main overworld. Pokmon Platinum, the enhanced version of Diamond and Pearlmuch like Pokmon Yellow, Crystal, and Emeraldwas released in September 2008 in Japan, March 2009 in North America, and May 2009 in Australia and Europe. Spin-off titles in the fourth generation include the Pokmon Stadium follow-up Pokmon Battle Revolution for Wii, which has Wi-Fi connectivity as well.[26] Nintendo announced in May 2009 that enhanced remakes of Pokmon Gold and Silver, entitled Pokmon HeartGold and SoulSilver, would be released for the Nintendo DS system. HeartGold and SoulSilver are set in the Johto region and were released in September 2009 in Japan[27] and March 2010 in North America.[28]\\r\\nThe fifth generation of Pokmon began on September 18, 2010, with the release of Pokmon Black and White in Japan for Nintendo DS.[29] The games were originally announced by the Pokmon Company on January 29, 2010, with a tentative release later that year.[30][31] The final release date of September 18 was announced on June 27, 2010.[32] This version is set in the Unova region (ˁAԴ, Isshu-chih, Isshu region), inspired by New York City, and utilizes the Nintendo DS's 3-D rendering capabilities to a greater extent than Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver, as shown in game footage of the player walking through the Castelia City (˚ū, Hiun Shiti) metropolis. A total of 156 new Pokmon were introduced, starting with Victini and ending with Genesect, bringing the franchise's total to 649. This is currently the only time that the number of Pokmon introduced surpasses the number introduced in the first generation.[33] It also deployed new game mechanics such as the C Gear (Cʧ, C Gia) wireless interactivity features[34] and the ability to upload game data to the Internet and to the player's own computer.[35] Pokmon Black and White was released in Europe on March 4, 2011, in North America on March 6, 2011, and in Australia on March 10, 2011. On June 23, 2012, Nintendo released Pokmon Black 2 and Pokmon White 2 in Japan for Nintendo DS, with early October releases in North America and Europe. Black 2 and White 2 are sequels to Black and White, with several events in the second games referencing events in the first; they also allow players to link their previous Black or White with their Black 2 or White 2, introducing several events based on how they played their previous game.\\r\\nOfficially announced on January 8, 2013, and released simultaneously worldwide on October 12, 2013, Pokmon X and Pokmon Y for the Nintendo 3DS are part of the sixth generation of games.[36] Introducing the France-inspired Kalos region, these are the first Pokmon games rendered in 3D, and the first released worldwide together.[37] A total of 72 new Pokmon were introduced, starting with Chespin and ending with Volcanion, bringing the franchise's total to 721. The fewest new Pokmon in a single generation so far; however, the new Mega Evolution feature was added to the games to balance out the lack of new characters. Another addition was the Fairy typing, the first new type since Dark and Steel in the second generation. On May 7, 2014, Nintendo announced remakes of the third generation games Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire titled Pokmon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire which were released in Japan, North America, Australia, and South Korea on November 21, 2014, and in Europe on November 28, 2014.\\r\\nOfficially announced on February 26, 2016, Pokmon Sun and Moon for the Nintendo 3DS are part of the seventh generation of games, and the celebrations for the 20th anniversary of the franchise, introducing the Hawaii-inspired Alola region. Both games were released worldwide on November 18, 2016, in nine languages; Japanese, English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Korean, and, for the first time, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified).[38] A total of 81 new Pokmon were introduced, bringing the total to 802. Though no new mega evolutions were added, a new type of form was added for specific Pokmon, called Alola Form, changing their types and move sets. A new type of move was added as well, called the Z-move. Usable by any Pokmon, Z-moves are extremely powerful and as such can only be used once per battle.\\r\\nThe main staple of the Pokmon video game series revolves around the catching and battling of Pokmon. Starting with a starter Pokmon, the player can catch wild Pokmon by weakening them and catching them with Pok Balls. Conversely, they can choose to defeat them in battle in order to gain experience for their Pokmon, raising their levels and teaching them new moves. Most Pokmon have 'evolution families', a term which refers to the Pokmon to evolve into or be evolved into more powerful forms by raising their levels or using certain items. Throughout the game, players will have to battle other trainers in order to progress, with the main goal to defeat various Gym Leaders/Trials and earn the right to become the regional champion. Subsequent games in the series have introduced various side games and side quests, including the Battle Frontiers that display unique battle types and the Pokmon Contests where visual appearance is put on display.\\r\\nOne of the consistent aspects of the Pokmon gamesspanning from Pokmon Red and Blue on the Game Boy to the Nintendo 3DS games Pokmon Sun and Moonis the choice of one of three different Pokmon at the start of the player's adventures; these three are often labeled \\"starter Pokmon\\". Players can choose a Grass-type, a Fire-type, or a Water-type.[39] For example, in Pokmon Red and Blue (and their respective remakes, Pokmon FireRed and Pokmon LeafGreen), the player has the choice of starting with Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle. The exception to this rule is Pokmon Yellow (a remake of the original games that loosely follows the story of the Pokmon anime), where players are given a Pikachu, an Electric-type mouse Pokmon, famous for being the mascot of the Pokmon media franchise; in this game, however, the three starter Pokmon from Red and Blue can be obtained by meeting certain requirements in game, such as Pikachu having full happiness.[40] Another consistent aspect is that the player's rival will always choose as his or her starter Pokmon the one that has a type advantage over the player's Pokmon. For instance, if the player picks a Grass-type Pokmon, the rival will always pick the Fire-type starter. An exception to this is again Pokmon Yellow, in which the rival picks an Eevee, but whether this Eevee evolves into Vaporeon, Jolteon, or Flareon is decided by when the player wins and loses to the rival through the journey. Pokmon Sun and Moon are also an exception where the rival will pick the starter weak toward the players, with the remaining starter used elsewhere. The GameCube games Pokmon Colosseum and Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness also contain an exception; whereas in most games the player's initial Pokmon starts at Level 5, in these two games the player's initial Pokmon starts at Levels 10 and 25, respectively. In Colosseum the player's starter Pokmon are Espeon and Umbreon, while in Gale of Darkness the player's starter is Eevee.\\r\\nThe Pokdex is an electronic device featured in the Pokmon video game, anime, and manga series. In the games, whenever a Pokmon is first captured, its data will be added to a player's Pokdex, but in the anime, the Pokdex is a comprehensive electronic reference encyclopedia, usually referred to in order to deliver exposition. \\"Pokdex\\" is also used to refer to a list of Pokmon, usually a list of Pokmon by number. In the video games, a Pokmon Trainer is issued a blank device at the start of the journey. A trainer must then attempt to fill the Pokdex by encountering and at least briefly obtaining each of the different species of Pokmon. A player will receive the name and image of a Pokmon after encountering one that was not previously in the Pokdex, typically after battling said Pokmon either in the wild or in a trainer battle (with the exceptions of link battles and tournament battles, such as in the Battle Frontier). In Pokmon Red and Blue, some Pokmon's data is added to the Pokdex simply by viewing the Pokmon, such as in the zoo outside the Safari Zone. Also, certain NPC characters may add to the Pokdex by explaining what a Pokmon looks like during conversation.\\r\\nMore detailed information is available after the player obtains a member of the species, either through capturing the Pokmon in the wild, evolving a previously captured Pokmon, hatching a Pokmon egg (from the second generation onwards), or through a trade with another trainer (either an NPC or another player). This information includes height, weight, species type, typing, and a short description of the Pokmon. Later versions of the Pokdex have more detailed information, like the size of a certain Pokmon compared to the player character, or Pokmon being sorted by their habitat (so far, the latter feature is only in the FireRed and LeafGreen versions). The most current forms of Pokdex are capable of containing information on all Pokmon currently known. The GameCube games, Pokmon Colosseum and Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, have a Pokmon Digital Assistant (PDA) which is similar to the Pokdex, but also tells what types are effective against a Pokmon and gives a description of its abilities.[41]\\r\\nThe Pokmon anime series and films are a meta-series of adventures usually separate from the canon that most of the Pokmon video games follow (with the exception of Pokmon Yellow, a game based loosely on the anime storyline). The anime follows the quest of the main character, Ash Ketchum (known as Satoshi in Japan), a Pokmon Master in training, as he and a small group of friends travel around the world of Pokmon along with their Pokmon partners.[42]\\r\\nThe original series, titled Pocket Monsters, or simply Pokmon in Western countries (often referred to as Pokmon: Gotta Catch 'Em All to distinguish it from the later series), begins with Ash's first day as a Pokmon trainer. His first (and signature) Pokmon is a Pikachu, differing from the games, where only Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle could be chosen.[43] The series follows the storyline of the original games, Pokmon Red and Blue, in the region of Kanto. Accompanying Ash on his journeys are Brock, the Pewter City Gym Leader, and Misty, the youngest of the Gym Leader sisters from Cerulean City. Pokmon: Adventures in the Orange Islands follows Ash's adventures in the Orange Islands, a place unique to the anime, and replaces Brock with Tracey Sketchit, an artist and \\"Pokmon watcher\\". The next series, based on the second generation of games, include Pokmon: Johto Journeys, Pokmon: Johto League Champions, and Pokmon: Master Quest, following the original trio of Ash, Brock, and Misty in the western Johto region.\\r\\nThe saga continues in Pokmon: Advanced, based on the third generation games. Ash and company travel to Hoenn, a southern region in the Pokmon World. Ash takes on the role of a teacher and mentor for a novice Pokmon trainer named May. Her brother Max accompanies them, and though he isn't a trainer, he knows large amounts of handy information. Brock (from the original series) soon catches up with Ash, but Misty has returned to Cerulean City to tend to her duties as a gym leader (Misty, along with other recurring characters, appears in the spin-off series Pokmon Chronicles). The Advanced series concludes with the Battle Frontier saga, based on the Emerald version and including aspects of FireRed and LeafGreen. It ended with Max leaving to pick his starter Pokmon and May going to the Grand Festival in Johto.\\r\\nIn the Diamond and Pearl series, based on the fourth generation games, Ash, Brock, and a new companion, an aspiring Pokmon coordinator named Dawn, travel through the region of Sinnoh. At the end of the series, Ash and Brock return to Kanto where Brock begins to follow his newfound dream of becoming a Pokmon doctor himself.\\r\\nPocket Monsters: Best Wishes!, based on the fifth generation games, features Ash and Pikachu traveling through the region of Unova (Isshu in Japan) alongside two new companions, Iris and Cilan (Dent in Japan) who part ways with them after returning to Kanto.\\r\\nPocket Monsters: XY (̸ƹXY, Poketo Monsut Ekkusu Wai), is the current airing series based on the sixth generation games, following Ash and Pikachu's journey through the region of Kalos, accompanied by Ash's childhood friend Serena and the siblings Clemont and Bonnie.[44][45][46]\\r\\nIn addition to the TV series, nineteen Pokmon films have been made, with the pair of films, Pokmon the Movie: BlackVictini and Reshiram and WhiteVictini and Zekrom considered together as one. A twentieth is also in production. Collectible bonuses, such as promotional trading cards, have been available with some of the films. Various children's books, collectively known as Pokmon Junior, are also based on the anime.[47]\\r\\nGiven release years are the original Japanese release years. The twentieth addition on this list is yet to be released.\\r\\nIt was announced by The Hollywood Reporter that Warner Bros. Pictures, Sony Pictures, and Legendary Pictures are in negotiations for a live action Pokmon movie.[48] Deadline reports that Legendary are closing a deal for the film after Pokmon Go's success and will also make a live Detective Pikachu movie as well with Universal Pictures distributing outside Japan.[49][50] Nicole Perlman and Alex Hirsch are penning the script.[15] Dean Israelite, Robert Rodriguez, Tim Miller, Mark A.Z. Dipp, Shane Acker and Chris Wedge were being considered as potential directors. Toho will distribute the film in Japan, while Universal Pictures will distribute it outside Japan. On November 30, 2016, Deadline reveals that Legendary Entertainment has chosen Rob Letterman to direct the film.[51] It was announced that the film's titled will be called Pokmon's Detective Pikachu.[52]\\r\\nPokmon CDs have been released in North America, most of them in conjunction with the theatrical releases of the first three Pokmon films. These releases were commonplace until late 2001. On March 27, 2007, a tenth anniversary CD was released containing 18 tracks from the English dub; this was the first English-language release in over five years. Soundtracks of the Pokmon feature films have been released in Japan each year in conjunction with the theatrical releases.\\r\\n^1 The exact date of release is unknown.\\r\\nThe Pokmon Trading Card Game (TCG) is a collectible card game with a goal similar to a Pokmon battle in the video game series. Players use Pokmon cards, with individual strengths and weaknesses, in an attempt to defeat their opponent by \\"knocking out\\" his or her Pokmon cards.[55] The game was first published in North America by Wizards of the Coast in 1999.[56] However, with the release of Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire Game Boy Advance video games, The Pokmon Company took back the card game from Wizards of the Coast and started publishing the cards themselves.[56] The Expedition expansion introduced the Pokmon-e Trading Card Game, where the cards (for the most part) were compatible with the Nintendo e-Reader. Nintendo discontinued its production of e-Reader compatible cards with the release of 'ex' FireRed & LeafGreen. In 1998, Nintendo released a Game Boy Color version of the trading card game in Japan; Pokmon Trading Card Game was subsequently released to the US and Europe in 2000. The game included digital versions cards from the original set of cards and the first two expansions (Jungle and Fossil), as well as several cards exclusive to the game. A Japan-exclusive sequel was released in 2001.[57]\\r\\nThere are various Pokmon manga series, four of which were released in English by Viz Media, and seven of them released in English by Chuang Yi. The manga series vary from game-based series to being based on the anime and the Trading Card Game. Original stories have also been published. As there are several series created by different authors most Pokmon manga series differ greatly from each other and other media, such as the anime. Pokmon Pocket Monsters and Pokmon Adventures are the only two manga never stopped since the first generation.\\r\\nA Monopoly board game was released in August 2014.[72]\\r\\nPokmon has been criticized by some Christians over perceived occult and violent themes and the concept of \\"Pokmon evolution\\", which they feel goes against the Biblical creation account in Genesis.[73] However, Sat2000, a satellite television station based in Vatican City, has countered that the Pokmon Trading Card Game and video games are \\"full of inventive imagination\\" and have no \\"harmful moral side effects\\".[74][75] In the United Kingdom, the \\"Christian Power Cards\\" game was introduced in 1999 by David Tate who stated, \\"Some people aren't happy with Pokmon and want an alternative, others just want Christian games.\\" The game was similar to the Pokmon Trading Card Game but used Biblical figures.[76]\\r\\nIn 1999, Nintendo stopped manufacturing the Japanese version of the \\"Koga's Ninja Trick\\" trading card because it depicted a manji, a traditionally Buddhist symbol with no negative connotations. The Jewish civil rights group Anti-Defamation League complained because the symbol is the reverse of a swastika, which is considered offensive to Jewish people. The cards were intended for sale in Japan only, but the popularity of Pokmon led to importation into the United States with approval from Nintendo. The Anti-Defamation League understood that the issue symbol was not intended to offend and acknowledged the sensitivity that Nintendo showed by removing the product.[77]\\r\\nIn 1999, two nine-year-old boys from Merrick, New York sued Nintendo because they claimed the Pokmon Trading Card Game caused their problematic gambling.[78]\\r\\nIn 2001, Saudi Arabia banned Pokmon games and cards, alleging that the franchise promoted Zionism by displaying the Star of David in the trading cards (a six-pointed star is featured in the card game) as well as other religious symbols such as crosses they associated with Christianity and triangles they associated with Freemasonry; the games also involved gambling, which is in violation of Muslim doctrine.[79][80]\\r\\nPokmon has also been accused of promoting materialism.[81]\\r\\nIn 2012, PETA publicly criticized the concept of Pokmon as supporting cruelty to animals. PETA compared the game's concept, of capturing animals and forcing them to fight, to cockfights, dog fighting rings and circuses, all events frequently criticized for cruelty to animals. PETA released a game spoofing Pokmon where the Pokmon battle their trainers to win their freedom.[82] PETA reaffirmed their objections in 2016 with the release of Pokmon Go, promoting the hashtag #GottaFreeThemAll.[83]\\r\\nOn December 16, 1997, more than 635 Japanese children were admitted to hospitals with epileptic seizures.[84] It was determined the seizures were caused by watching an episode of Pokmon \\"Denn Senshi Porygon\\", (most commonly translated \\"Electric Soldier Porygon\\", season 1, episode 38); as a result, this episode has not been aired since. In this particular episode, there were bright explosions with rapidly alternating blue and red color patterns.[85] It was determined in subsequent research that these strobing light effects cause some individuals to have epileptic seizures, even if the person had no previous history of epilepsy.[86] This incident is a common focus of Pokmon-related parodies in other media, and was lampooned by the Simpsons episode \\"Thirty Minutes over Tokyo\\"[87] and the South Park episode \\"Chinpokomon\\",[88] among others.\\r\\nIn March 2000, Morrison Entertainment Group, a small toy developer based at Manhattan Beach, California, sued Nintendo over claims that Pokmon infringed on its own Monster in My Pocket characters. A judge ruled there was no infringement, so Morrison appealed the ruling. On February 4, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision by the District Court to dismiss the suit.[89]\\r\\nWithin its first two days of release, Pokmon Go raised safety concerns among players. Multiple people also suffered minor injuries from falling while playing the game due to being distracted.[90]\\r\\nMultiple police departments in various countries have issued warnings, some tongue-in-cheek, regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one's surroundings.[91][92] People have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game,[93][94][95][96] and Bosnian players have been warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s Bosnian War.[97] On July 20, 2016, it was reported that an 18-year-old boy in Chiquimula, Guatemala was shot and killed while playing the game in the late evening hours.[98] This was the first reported death in connection with the app. The boy's 17-year-old cousin, who was accompanying the victim, was shot in the foot. Police speculated that the shooters used the game's GPS capability to find the two.[99]\\r\\nPokmon, being a globally popular franchise, has left a significant mark on today's pop culture. The Pokmon characters themselves have become pop culture icons; examples include two different Pikachu balloons in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Pokmon Jets operated by All Nippon Airways, thousands of merchandise items, and a traveling theme park that was in Nagoya, Japan in 2005 and in Taipei in 2006. Pokmon also appeared on the cover of the U.S. magazine Time in 1999. The Comedy Central show Drawn Together has a character named Ling-Ling who is a direct parody of Pikachu.[100] Several other shows such as ReBoot, The Simpsons, South Park, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, Robot Chicken, All Grown Up!, and Johnny Test have made references and spoofs of Pokmon, among other series. Pokmon was also featured on VH1's I Love the '90s: Part Deux. A live action show called Pokmon Live! toured the United States in late 2000. It was based on the popular Pokmon anime, but had some continuity errors relating to it. Jim Butcher cites Pokmon as one of the inspirations for the Codex Alera series of novels.\\r\\nIn November 2001, Nintendo opened a store called the Pokmon Center in New York, in New York's Rockefeller Center,[101] modeled after the two other Pokmon Center stores in Tokyo and Osaka and named after a staple of the videogame series; Pokmon Centers are fictional buildings where Trainers take their injured Pokmon to be healed after combat.[102] The store sold Pokmon merchandise on a total of two floors, with items ranging from collectible shirts to stuffed Pokmon plushies.[103] The store also featured a Pokmon Distributing Machine in which players would place their game to receive an egg of a Pokmon that was being given out at that time. The store also had tables that were open for players of the Pokmon Trading Card Game to duel each other or an employee. The store was closed and replaced by the Nintendo World Store on May 14, 2005.[104] Three Pokmon Center kiosks were put in malls in Washington, with one in Tacoma and one in Seattle currently remaining.[105][unreliable source?] The Pokmon Center online store was relaunched on August 6, 2014.[106]\\r\\nJoseph Jay Tobin theorizes that the success of the franchise was mainly due to the long list of names that could be learned by children and repeated in their peer groups. The rich fictional universe provided a lot of opportunities for discussion and demonstration of knowledge in front of their peers. In the French version Nintendo took care to translate the name of the creatures so that they reflected the French culture and language. In all cases the names of the creatures were linked to its characteristics, which converged with the children's belief that names have symbolic power. Children could pick their favourite Pokmon and affirm their individuality while at the same time affirming their conformance to the values of the group, and they could distinguish themselves from other kids by asserting what they liked and what they didn't like from every chapter. Pokmon gained popularity because it provided a sense of identity to a wide variety of children, and lost it quickly when many of those children found that the identity groups were too big and searched for identities that would distinguish them into smaller groups.[107]\\r\\nPokmon's history has been marked at times by rivalry with the Digimon media franchise that debuted at a similar time. Described as \\"the other 'mon'\\" by IGN's Juan Castro, Digimon has not enjoyed Pokmon's level of international popularity or success, but has maintained a dedicated fanbase.[108] IGN's Lucas M. Thomas stated that Pokmon is Digimon's \\"constant competition and comparison\\", attributing the former's relative success to the simplicity of its evolution mechanic as opposed to Digivolution.[109] The two have been noted for conceptual and stylistic similarities by sources such as GameZone.[110] A debate among fans exists over which of the two franchises came first.[111] In actuality, the first Pokmon media, Pokmon Red and Green, were released initially on February 27, 1996;[112] whereas the Digimon virtual pet was released on June 26, 1997.\\r\\nWhile Pokmon's target demographic is young boys, early purchasers of Pokmon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire were in their 20's.[113] Many fans are adults who originally played the games as children and later returned to the series.\\r\\nBulbapedia, a wiki-based encyclopedia[114] associated with longtime fan site Bulbagarden,[115][116] is the \\"Internet's most detailed Pokmon database project\\".[117] Bulbapedia finally received a mobile makeover with the release of BulbaGo, the app for Bulbapedia. The app's developer, Jonathan Zarra, was the same that created the location based chat app GoChat for Pokmon Go. The Bulbapedia App was so successful that within 3 days of its release, it was acquired by Bulbapedia and turned into its official app.\\r\\nA significant community around the Pokmon video games' metagame has existed for a long time, analyzing the best ways to use each Pokmon to their full potential in competitive battles. The most prolific competitive community is Smogon University, which has created a widely accepted tier-based battle system.[118]\\r\\nIn early 2014, an anonymous video streamer on Twitch launched Twitch Plays Pokmon, an experiment trying to crowdsource playing subsequent Pokmon games starting with Pokmon Red.[119][120]\\r\\nA challenge called the Nuzlocke Challenge was created in order for older players of the series to enjoy Pokmon again, but with a twist. When a Pokmon faints it is considered \\"dead\\" and must be released or stored in the PC permanently.[121] If the player blacks out/whites out the game is considered over and the player must restart.[122] The original idea only consisted of 2 to 3 rules that the community has since built upon. There are many fan made Pokmon games made that contains a game mode similar to the Nuzlocke Challenge, such as Pokmon Uranium.[123]\\r\\nAn online Pokmon game was created called Pokmon Showdown, in which players create a team and battle against other players around the world.[124]","input":"When did pokemon become popular in the us?"},{"output":"eight","context":"The Solar System[a] is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.[b] Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets,[c] with the remainder being smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.[d]\\r\\nThe Solar System formed 4.6?billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.\\r\\nThe Solar System also contains smaller objects.[e] The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations are several dozen to possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough that they have been rounded by their own gravity.[10] Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified dwarf planets include the asteroid Ceres and the trans-Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris.[e] In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, at least four of the dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites,[f] usually termed \\"moons\\" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.\\r\\nThe solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out to the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most of history, humanity did not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System. Most people up to the Late Middle AgesÿRenaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system.[11][12] In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that govern Earth. The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons. Improvements in the telescope and the use of unmanned spacecraft have enabled the investigation of geological phenomena, such as mountains, craters, seasonal meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, dust storms and ice caps on the other planets.\\r\\nThe principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a G2 main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally.[13] The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.[g]\\r\\nMost large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets are very close to the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are frequently at significantly greater angles to it.[17][18] All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole).[19] There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.\\r\\nThe overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets.[20] Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.[21]\\r\\nMost of the planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites, or moons (two of which, Titan and Ganymede, are larger than the planet Mercury), and, in the case of the four giant planets, by planetary rings, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent.\\r\\nKepler's laws of planetary motion describe the orbits of objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly because they are more affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using numerical models.\\r\\nAlthough the Sun dominates the system by mass, it accounts for only about 2% of the angular momentum.[22][23] The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.[22]\\r\\nThe Sun, which comprises nearly all the matter in the Solar System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium.[24] Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise nearly all the remaining matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.[25][26] A composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and light pressure from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points.[27] The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could condense is known as the frost line, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.[5]\\r\\nThe objects of the inner Solar System are composed mostly of rock,[28] the collective name for compounds with high melting points, such as silicates, iron or nickel, that remained solid under almost all conditions in the protoplanetary nebula.[29] Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of gases, the astronomical term for materials with extremely low melting points and high vapour pressure, such as hydrogen, helium, and neon, which were always in the gaseous phase in the nebula.[29] Ices, like water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide,[28] have melting points up to a few hundred kelvins.[29] They can be found as ices, liquids, or gases in various places in the Solar System, whereas in the nebula they were either in the solid or gaseous phase.[29] Icy substances comprise the majority of the satellites of the giant planets, as well as most of Uranus and Neptune (the so-called \\"ice giants\\") and the numerous small objects that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.[28][30] Together, gases and ices are referred to as volatiles.[31]\\r\\nThe distance from Earth to the Sun is 1 astronomical unit (150,000,000?km), or AU. For comparison, the radius of the Sun is 0.0047?AU (700,000?km). Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (10?5?%) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly one millionth (10?6) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is 5.2 astronomical units (780,000,000?km) from the Sun and has a radius of 71,000?km (0.00047?AU), whereas the most distant planet, Neptune, is 30?AU (4.5G109?km) from the Sun.\\r\\nWith a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts have been made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the TitiusÿBode law),[32] but no such theory has been accepted. The images at the beginning of this section show the orbits of the various constituents of the Solar System on different scales.\\r\\nSome Solar System models attempt to convey the relative scales involved in the Solar System on human terms. Some are small in scale (and may be mechanicalcalled orreries)whereas others extend across cities or regional areas.[33] The largest such scale model, the Sweden Solar System, uses the 110-metre (361?ft) Ericsson Globe in Stockholm as its substitute Sun, and, following the scale, Jupiter is a 7.5-metre (25-foot) sphere at Arlanda International Airport, 40?km (25?mi) away, whereas the farthest current object, Sedna, is a 10?cm (4?in) sphere in Lule?, 912?km (567?mi) away.[34][35]\\r\\nIf the SunÿNeptune distance is scaled to 100 metres, then the Sun would be about 3?cm in diameter (roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball), the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3?mm, and Earth's diameter along with that of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea (0.3?mm) at this scale.[36]\\r\\nDistances of selected bodies of the Solar System from the Sun. The left and right edges of each bar correspond to the perihelion and aphelion of the body, respectively, hence long bars denote high orbital eccentricity. The radius of the Sun is 0.7 million km, and the radius of Jupiter (the largest planet) is 0.07 million km, both too small to resolve on this image.\\r\\nThe Solar System formed 4.568?billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.[h] This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars.[38] As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar nebula,[39] collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The centre, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.[38] As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200?AU[38] and a hot, dense protostar at the centre.[40][41] The planets formed by accretion from this disc,[42] in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.\\r\\nDue to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would eventually form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.\\r\\nWithin 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.[43] The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star.[44] The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10?billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined.[45] Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.[46]\\r\\nThe Solar System will remain roughly as we know it today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5?billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence.[45] The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth.[47] The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sunbut now enriched with heavier elements like carbonto the interstellar medium.\\r\\nThe Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses),[48] which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System,[49] produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a main-sequence star.[50] This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.[51]\\r\\nThe Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous. The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.[52][53]\\r\\nThe Sun is a population I star; it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium (\\"metals\\" in astronomical parlance) than the older population II stars.[54] Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so the first generation of stars had to die before the Universe could be enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas stars born later have more. This high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun's development of a planetary system because the planets form from the accretion of \\"metals\\".[55]\\r\\nThe vast majority of the Solar System consists of a near-vacuum known as the interplanetary medium. Along with light, the Sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles (a plasma) known as the solar wind. This stream of particles spreads outwards at roughly 1.5?million kilometres per hour,[56] creating a tenuous atmosphere that permeates the interplanetary medium out to at least 100?AU (see ?Heliosphere).[57] Activity on the Sun's surface, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, disturb the heliosphere, creating space weather and causing geomagnetic storms.[58] The largest structure within the heliosphere is the heliospheric current sheet, a spiral form created by the actions of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium.[59][60]\\r\\nEarth's magnetic field stops its atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.[61] Venus and Mars do not have magnetic fields, and as a result the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space.[62] Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material from the surface of the Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.\\r\\nThe heliosphere and planetary magnetic fields (for those planets that have them) partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays. The density of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium and the strength of the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown.[63]\\r\\nThe interplanetary medium is home to at least two disc-like regions of cosmic dust. The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the inner Solar System and causes the zodiacal light. It was likely formed by collisions within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the planets.[64] The second dust cloud extends from about 10?AU to about 40?AU, and was probably created by similar collisions within the Kuiper belt.[65][66]\\r\\nThe inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt.[67] Composed mainly of silicates and metals, the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This region is also within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU (about 700 million km) from the Sun.[68]\\r\\nThe four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems. They are composed largely of refractory minerals, such as the silicates, which form their crusts and mantles, and metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet should not be confused with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).\\r\\nAsteroids except for the largest, Ceres, are classified as small Solar System bodies[e] and are composed mainly of refractory rocky and metallic minerals, with some ice.[82][83] They range from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres in size. Asteroids smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids (grain-sized), depending on different, somewhat arbitrary definitions.\\r\\nThe asteroid belt occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3?AU from the Sun. It is thought to be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter.[84] The asteroid belt contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter.[85] Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely to be more than a thousandth of that of Earth.[16] The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.\\r\\nThe outer region of the Solar System is home to the giant planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region. Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.\\r\\nThe four outer planets, or giant planets (sometimes called Jovian planets), collectively make up 99% of the mass known to orbit the Sun.[g] Jupiter and Saturn are together more than 400 times the mass of Earth and consist overwhelmingly of hydrogen and helium; Uranus and Neptune are far less massive (<20 Earth masses each) and are composed primarily of ices. For these reasons, some astronomers suggest they belong in their own category, \\"ice giants\\".[90] All four giant planets have rings, although only Saturn's ring system is easily observed from Earth. The term superior planet designates planets outside Earth's orbit and thus includes both the outer planets and Mars.\\r\\nThe centaurs are icy comet-like bodies whose orbits have semi-major axes greater than Jupiter's (5.5?AU) and less than Neptune's (30?AU). The largest known centaur, 10199 Chariklo, has a diameter of about 250?km.[97] The first centaur discovered, 2060 Chiron, has also been classified as comet (95P) because it develops a coma just as comets do when they approach the Sun.[98]\\r\\nComets are small Solar System bodies,[e] typically only a few kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye.\\r\\nShort-period comets have orbits lasting less than two hundred years. Long-period comets have orbits lasting thousands of years. Short-period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as HaleÿBopp, are thought to originate in the Oort cloud. Many comet groups, such as the Kreutz Sungrazers, formed from the breakup of a single parent.[99] Some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult.[100] Old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.[101]\\r\\nBeyond the orbit of Neptune lies the area of the \\"trans-Neptunian region\\", with the doughnut-shaped Kuiper belt, home of Pluto and several other dwarf planets, and an overlapping disc of scattered objects, which is tilted toward the plane of the Solar System and reaches much further out than the Kuiper belt. The entire region is still largely unexplored. It appears to consist overwhelmingly of many thousands of small worldsthe largest having a diameter only a fifth that of Earth and a mass far smaller than that of the Mooncomposed mainly of rock and ice. This region is sometimes described as the \\"third zone of the Solar System\\", enclosing the inner and the outer Solar System.[102]\\r\\nThe Kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice.[103] It extends between 30 and 50?AU from the Sun. Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such as Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus, may prove to be dwarf planets with further data. There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50?km, but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth.[15] Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites,[104] and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.[105]\\r\\nThe Kuiper belt can be roughly divided into the \\"classical\\" belt and the resonances.[103] Resonances are orbits linked to that of Neptune (e.g. twice for every three Neptune orbits, or once for every two). The first resonance begins within the orbit of Neptune itself. The classical belt consists of objects having no resonance with Neptune, and extends from roughly 39.4?AU to 47.7?AU.[106] Members of the classical Kuiper belt are classified as cubewanos, after the first of their kind to be discovered, 15760 Albion (which previously had the provisional designation 1992 QB1), and are still in near primordial, low-eccentricity orbits.[107]\\r\\nThe scattered disc, which overlaps the Kuiper belt but extends much further outwards, is thought to be the source of short-period comets. Scattered-disc objects are thought to have been ejected into erratic orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune's early outward migration. Most scattered disc objects (SDOs) have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but aphelia far beyond it (some more than 150?AU from the Sun). SDOs' orbits are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane and are often almost perpendicular to it. Some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt and describe scattered disc objects as \\"scattered Kuiper belt objects\\".[112] Some astronomers also classify centaurs as inward-scattered Kuiper belt objects along with the outward-scattered residents of the scattered disc.[113]\\r\\nThe point at which the Solar System ends and interstellar space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this heliopause, the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium.[57] The Sun's Hill sphere, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.[115]\\r\\nThe heliosphere is a stellar-wind bubble, a region of space dominated by the Sun, which radiates at roughly 400?km/s its solar wind, a stream of charged particles, until it collides with the wind of the interstellar medium.\\r\\nThe collision occurs at the termination shock, which is roughly 80ÿ100?AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200?AU from the Sun downwind.[116] Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent,[116] forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought to look and behave very much like a comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40?AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.[117]\\r\\nThe outer boundary of the heliosphere, the heliopause, is the point at which the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of interstellar space.[57] Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, at 94 and 84?AU from the Sun, respectively.[118][119] Voyager 1 is reported to have crossed the heliopause in August 2012.[120]\\r\\nThe shape and form of the outer edge of the heliosphere is likely affected by the fluid dynamics of interactions with the interstellar medium as well as solar magnetic fields prevailing to the south, e.g. it is bluntly shaped with the northern hemisphere extending 9?AU farther than the southern hemisphere.[116] Beyond the heliopause, at around 230 AU, lies the bow shock, a plasma \\"wake\\" left by the Sun as it travels through the Milky Way.[121]\\r\\nDue to a lack of data, conditions in local interstellar space are not known for certain. It is expected that NASA's Voyager spacecraft, as they pass the heliopause, will transmit valuable data on radiation levels and solar wind to Earth.[122] How well the heliosphere shields the Solar System from cosmic rays is poorly understood. A NASA-funded team has developed a concept of a \\"Vision Mission\\" dedicated to sending a probe to the heliosphere.[123][124]\\r\\n90377 Sedna (520 AU average) is a large, reddish object with a gigantic, highly elliptical orbit that takes it from about 76?AU at perihelion to 940?AU at aphelion and takes 11,400 years to complete. Mike Brown, who discovered the object in 2003, asserts that it cannot be part of the scattered disc or the Kuiper belt because its perihelion is too distant to have been affected by Neptune's migration. He and other astronomers consider it to be the first in an entirely new population, sometimes termed \\"distant detached objects\\" (DDOs), which also may include the object 2000 CR105, which has a perihelion of 45?AU, an aphelion of 415?AU, and an orbital period of 3,420 years.[125] Brown terms this population the \\"inner Oort cloud\\" because it may have formed through a similar process, although it is far closer to the Sun.[126] Sedna is very likely a dwarf planet, though its shape has yet to be determined. The second unequivocally detached object, with a perihelion farther than Sedna's at roughly 81 AU, is 2012 VP113, discovered in 2012. Its aphelion is only half that of Sedna's, at 400ÿ500 AU.[127][128]\\r\\nThe Oort cloud is a hypothetical spherical cloud of up to a trillion icy objects that is thought to be the source for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000?AU (around 1?light-year (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000?AU (1.87?ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the galactic tide, the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way.[129][130]\\r\\nMuch of the Solar System is still unknown. The Sun's gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two light years (125,000 AU). Lower estimates for the radius of the Oort cloud, by contrast, do not place it farther than 50,000 AU.[131] Despite discoveries such as Sedna, the region between the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud, an area tens of thousands of AU in radius, is still virtually unmapped. There are also ongoing studies of the region between Mercury and the Sun.[132] Objects may yet be discovered in the Solar System's uncharted regions.\\r\\nCurrently, the furthest known objects, such as Comet West, have aphelia around 70,000 AU from the Sun, but as the Oort cloud becomes better known, this may change.\\r\\nThe Solar System is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter of about 100,000 light-years containing about 100?billion stars.[133] The Sun resides in one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the OrionÿCygnus Arm or Local Spur.[134] The Sun lies between 25,000 and 28,000 light-years from the Galactic Centre,[135] and its speed within the Milky Way is about 220?km/s, so that it completes one revolution every 225ÿ250?million years. This revolution is known as the Solar System's galactic year.[136] The solar apex, the direction of the Sun's path through interstellar space, is near the constellation Hercules in the direction of the current location of the bright star Vega.[137] The plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about 60 to the galactic plane.[i]\\r\\nThe Solar System's location in the Milky Way is a factor in the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Its orbit is close to circular, and orbits near the Sun are at roughly the same speed as that of the spiral arms.[139][140] Therefore, the Sun passes through arms only rarely. Because spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of supernovae, gravitational instabilities, and radiation that could disrupt the Solar System, this has given Earth long periods of stability for life to evolve.[139] The Solar System also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre. Near the centre, gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the Oort cloud and send many comets into the inner Solar System, producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on Earth. The intense radiation of the galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex life.[139] Even at the Solar System's current location, some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last 35,000 years, by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the Sun, as radioactive dust grains and larger, comet-like bodies.[141]\\r\\nThe Solar System is in the Local Interstellar Cloud or Local Fluff. It is thought to be near the neighbouring G-Cloud but it is not known if the Solar System is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud, or if it is in the region where the Local Interstellar Cloud and G-Cloud are interacting.[142][143] The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the Local Bubble, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.[144]\\r\\nThere are relatively few stars within ten light-years of the Sun. The closest is the triple star system Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4 light-years away. Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the small red dwarf, Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-year. In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was confirmed to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun.[145] The stars next closest to the Sun are the red dwarfs Barnard's Star (at 5.9?ly), Wolf 359 (7.8?ly), and Lalande 21185 (8.3?ly).\\r\\nThe largest nearby star is Sirius, a bright main-sequence star roughly 8.6 light-years away and roughly twice the Sun's mass and that is orbited by a white dwarf, Sirius B. The nearest brown dwarfs are the binary Luhman 16 system at 6.6 light-years. Other systems within ten light-years are the binary red-dwarf system Luyten 726-8 (8.7?ly) and the solitary red dwarf Ross 154 (9.7?ly).[146] The closest solitary Sun-like star to the Solar System is Tau Ceti at 11.9 light-years. It has roughly 80% of the Sun's mass but only 60% of its luminosity.[147] The closest known free-floating planetary-mass object to the Sun is WISE 0855?0714,[148] an object with a mass less than 10 Jupiter masses roughly 7 light-years away.\\r\\nCompared to other planetary systems the Solar System stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of Mercury.[149][150] The known Solar System also lacks super-Earths (Planet Nine could be a super-Earth beyond the known Solar System).[149] Uncommonly, it has only small rocky planets and large gas giants; elsewhere planets of intermediate size are typicalboth rocky and gasso there is no \\"gap\\" as seen between the size of Earth and of Neptune (with a radius 3.8 times as large). Also, these super-Earths have closer orbits than Mercury.[149] This led to hypothesis that all planetary systems start with many close-in planets, and that typically a sequence of their collisions causes consolidation of mass into few larger planets, but in case of the Solar System the collisions caused their destruction and ejection.[151][152]\\r\\nThe orbits of Solar System planets are nearly circular. Compared to other systems, they have smaller orbital eccentricity.[149] Although there are attempts to explain it partly with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets, the exact causes remain undetermined.[149][153]\\r\\nThis section is a sampling of Solar System bodies, selected for size and quality of imagery, and sorted by volume.

National Geographic has ranked Myrtle Beach Boardwalk number three in the United States,[2] while Travel and Leisure ranked the boardwalk number two.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northern section, 8 feet (2.4?m) wide[4] with a raised wooden deck design,[5] runs from Pier 14 to Plyler Park, the location of \\"Hot Summer Nights\\", with live music twice a week during the summer,[6] and weekly attractions that include a \\"Kids Carnival\\", bagpipes, and a Dixieland band.[7] The middle section, from Plyler Park to the former site of Myrtle Beach Pavilion, has \\"a carnival atmosphere accompanied by restaurants, bars and gift shops\\".[6] The Southern Promenade,[8] from the former Pavilion to 2nd Avenue Pier, city officials describe as a \\"meandering oceanfront park\\"[6] with benches and landscaping.[5] The 2nd Avenue Pier is the location of weekly fireworks. The contractor responsible for constructing the MB Boardwalk Project is M.B. Kahn Construction Co., Inc.,[9] according to city officials,[6] used close to 770,000 board-feet of lumber, 555,000 screws, and 300,000 nails. The city contributed 600 palmetto trees and 50,000 beach grass seedlings.[10]\\r\\nMyrtle Beach had a wooden boardwalk in the 1930s. After being upgraded with concrete in 1940, with plans to expand it delayed by World War II,[11] it was destroyed by Hurricane Hazel in 1954. All that remained was a concrete walkway between 9th Avenue North and 11th Avenue North, later renamed Mr. Joe White Avenue.[12] The 1999 Pavilion Area Master Plan included a boardwalk.[13] When the Pavilion closed in 2006 after 58 years, area merchants wanted an attraction to replace it. A mile-long boardwalk had been discussed for several years, but the estimated cost was $10 million, and even if construction started in 2007, it would not be complete until 2010. A major storm could also damage the new attraction. Sebok said \\"Most tourists expect a boardwalk ... and we really don't have one to speak of.\\" [14]\\r\\nThe city allocated $285,000 for design, and The LandArt Co. made preliminary sketches that included benches and planters.[15] By 2007, the cost estimate had risen to $12 million and the start date was Fall 2008. The city was considering several payment methods. City manager Tom Leath wanted a tax district where businesses nearby would pay more because they would benefit more, while some believed the entire city should contribute since the boardwalk would be good for everyone. Opponents of the tax district wondered if small businesses could pay. Some people worried about crime and vagrants.[16]\\r\\nA design with \\"a traditional wood-plank walkway\\" and \\"a meandering concrete sidewalk ... with wooden crosswalks to the beach, colorful shade sails and public parks\\" was presented to city council Aug. 14, 2007, but funding was still not set.[17] Burroughs & Chapin, which had torn down the Pavilion building and cleared the 11-acre (45,000?m2) site of the amusement park over the previous year,[18] agreed to pay for the section across the 11-acre (45,000?m2) Pavilion site, using a design matching that in the other areas.[17]\\r\\nGroundbreaking took place in September 2009, despite a dispute between the city and Burroughs & Chapin, with a question over whether the company would pay for its section. Nevertheless, the company supported the boardwalk and expected its plans for the Pavilion site would benefit. The cost of the project had been cut in half,[19] mainly due to the economic slowdown, making companies more eager to get work. A controversial sales tax for tourism promotion has made it possible, without raising property taxes in the area, to pay off bonds the city issued to finance the project.[13]\\r\\nThe boardwalk was finished from 14th Avenue to 4th Avenue early in April.[20] The boardwalk opened in May 2010 with a ribbon-cutting held May 15 as part of the Beach Music Festival. It attracted people from the area and across the country who had not been downtown in years.[10] The southernmost section, beyond 4th Avenue, was not complete until June.[21]\\r\\nOn December 1, 2011, the Myrtle Beach Community Appearance Board saw plans for a new restaurant and park north of 14th Avenue North, which could include an extension of the boardwalk, but it was not known who would pay to add to the boardwalk.[22] On January 24, 2012, the city council agreed to allow alleys to be moved, creating space for the new park. Coastal Dining planned to build the Banditos Mexican restaurant where the Breakwater Inn was before its demolition, and to pay part of the $420,000 cost of the boardwalk extension as well as connecting 15th Avenue North to Ocean Boulevard.[23] The 425-foot (130?m) extension was completed in 2013.[4][24]\\r\\nOn November 8, 2012 at a meeting of people involved in making the boardwalk possible, Mayor John Rhodes stated a goal of spending $20 million to extend the boardwalk to a length of 4.6 miles (7.4?km). This would make the boardwalk longer than the one in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The city would ask companies and organizations to contribute the money. If the city approved the plan, the boardwalk would start two miles further south at Springmaid Pier, and it would end one mile farther north. Also, boardwalk designer Mike Wooten stated his interest in widening the boardwalk, which would require action by the South Carolina legislature.[4][25] In 2013, a presentation was made to the city council.[24]\\r\\nThe Myrtle Beach Downtown Redevelopment Corporation voted on April 16, 2014 to plan for a municipal improvement district in which extra property taxes would be paid. If the city council voted for this idea, the revenue could be used for projects that would help downtown. Private sponsorships, however, were the preferred means of financing extensions.[26]\\r\\nBuchanan Motels LLC planned a 23-story hotel at 17th Avenue North which would begin construction in 2015, and among their planned improvements for the area was a $500,000 extension of the boardwalk to 18th Avenue North.[27]\\r\\nEven during the boardwalk's construction, the national media showed interest in the boardwalk.[8] CBS' The Early Show, including meteorologist Dave Price, broadcast live on May 14, 2010, the weekend of the official opening.[21] Team Sandtastic made a sand sculpture of Price. Also, Cake Boss Buddy Valastro from TLC helped produce a 10-foot 1200-pound cake in the shape of a flip-flop, made in Hoboken, New Jersey, and delivered to the May opening ceremony. The episode aired October 25, 2010.[28][29][30] Travel and Leisure named Myrtle Beach Boardwalk the number two boardwalk mainly because of the entertainers, and The Today Show featured the report.[3][31] On July 14, 2010, National Geographic ranked the Myrtle Beach Boardwalk behind the boardwalks at Atlantic City, New Jersey and Coney Island, and calling it \\"the town's hub of activity\\".[2] Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce president Brad Dean estimated that publicity resulting from the boardwalk reached the equivalent of more than $1 million.[13]\\r\\nThis event happens from October 7th thru Halloween. The boardwalk at dusk turns into a spooky Halloween themed beach that has live zombies and haunted attractions.[32]\\r\\nHosted by the Oceanfront Merchants Association and the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber o f Commerce. The festival is from June 3 until June 5 to kickoff the summer season. There are parades, entertainers, music, and food.

The term Filipino American is sometimes shortened to \\"Fil-Ams\\",[7] or \\"Pinoy\\". According to Filipino American historian Dawn Mabalon, the earliest appearance of the term Pinoy (alt. Pinay), was in a 1926 issue of the Filipino Student Bulletin.[citation needed] The article that featured the terms, is titled, \\"Filipino Women in U.S. Excel in Their Courses: Invade Business, Politics.\\"[8] Some Filipinos believe that the term Pinoy was coined by Filipinos who came to the United States to distinguish themselves from Filipinos living in the Philippines.[9][dubious ÿ discuss][additional citation needed]\\r\\nFilipinos in North America were first documented in the 16th century,[10] with small settlements beginning in the 18th century.[11] Mass migration did not begin until the early 20th century, when the Philippines was ceded from Spain to the United States in the Treaty of Paris.[12][13]\\r\\nFilipino sailors were the first Asians in North America.[14] The first recorded presence of Filipinos in what is now the United States dates back to October 1587 around Morro Bay, California, with the first permanent settlement in Louisiana in 1763,[15] with small settlements beginning in the 18th century.[16] Mass migration began in the early 20th century when, for a period following the 1898 Treaty of Paris, the Philippines was a territory of the United States. During the 1920s, a majority of Filipino workers who arrived in the United States lacked necessary training.[17]\\r\\nPhilippine independence was recognized by the United States on July 4, 1946. After independence in 1946, Filipino American numbers continued to grow. Immigration was reduced significantly during the 1930s, except for those who served in the United States Navy, and increased following immigration reform in the 1960s.[18] The population of Filipino immigrant workers, as well the quality of their skills, improved following the passing of the Immigration Act of 1965.[17]\\r\\nThe 2010 Census counted 3.4 million Filipino Americans, while the United States Department of State in 2011 estimated the total at 4 million, or 1.1% of the U.S. population. the total at 4 million, or 1.1% of the U.S. population. They are the country's second largest self-reported Asian ancestry group after Chinese Americans according to 2010 American Community Survey.[19][20] They are also the largest population of Overseas Filipinos.[21] Significant populations of Filipino Americans can be found in California, Hawaii, the New York metropolitan area and Illinois.\\r\\nThe history of Spanish and American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of Eastern and Western cultures in the Philippines.[22] Filipino American cultural identity has been described as fluid, adopting aspects from various cultures;[23] that said there has not been significant research into the culture of Filipino Americans.[24] Fashion, dance, music, theater and arts have all had roles in building Filipino American cultural identities and communities.[25][page?needed]\\r\\nIn areas of sparse Filipino population, they often form loosely-knit social organizations aimed at maintaining a \\"sense of family\\", which is a key feature of Filipino culture. These organizations generally arrange social events, especially of a charitable nature, and keep members up-to-date with local events.[26] Organizations are often organized into regional associations.[27] The associations are a small part of Filipino American life. Filipino Americans formed close-knit neighborhoods, notably in California and Hawaii.[28] A few communities have \\"Little Manilas\\", civic and business districts tailored for the Filipino American community.[29]\\r\\nSome Filipinos retain Philippine surnames, such as Bacdayan or Macapagal, while others derive from Japanese, Indian, and Chinese and reflect centuries of trade with these merchants preceding European and American rule.[30][31][32] Reflecting its 333 years of Spanish rule, many Filipinos adopted Hispanic surnames,[30] and celebrate fiestas.[33] Due to the legacy of colonization, Filipinos are considered Latinos of Asia.[34]\\r\\nDespite being from Asia, Filipinos are sometimes called \\"Latinos\\" due to their historical relationship to Spanish colonialism.[34] Similar to Puerto Rico, Filipinos have been subjected to both Spanish and American colonial structures and territory status.[35] This shared history may also contribute to why some Filipinos choose to also identify as Hispanic or Latino, while others may not and identify more as Asian Americans.[36] Only a small percentage of Filipino Americans identify as Latino.[37]\\r\\nFilipino and English are constitutionally established as official languages in the Philippines, and Filipino is designated as the national language, with English in wide use.[38] Many Filipinos speak American English due to American colonial influence in the country's education system and due to limited Spanish education.[39] Among Asian Americans in 1990, Filipino Americans had the smallest percentage of individuals who had problems with English.[40] In 2000, among U.S.-born Filipino Americans, three quarters responded that English is their primary language.[41]\\r\\nTagalog is the fifth most-spoken language in the United States, with 1.262 million speakers.[4] Many of California's public announcements and documents are translated into Tagalog.[42] Tagalog is also taught in some public schools, as well as in higher education.[43] Other significant Filipino languages are Ilocano and Cebuano.[44] Other languages spoken in Filipino American households include Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Hiligaynon, Bicolano and Waray.[45] However, fluency in Philippine languages tends to be lost among second- and third-generation Filipino Americans.[46] Other languages of the community include Spanish and Chinese (Minnan and Fujien).[5]\\r\\nThe Philippines is 90% Christian,[33][47] one of only two such countries in Asia, along with East Timor.[48] Following the European discovery of the Philippines by Ferdinand Magellan, Spaniards made a concerted effort to convert Filipinos to Catholicism; outside of the Muslim Sultanates in the Philippines, missionaries were able to covert large numbers of Filipinos.[47] and the majority are Roman Catholic, giving Catholicism a major impact on Filipino culture.[49] Other denominations include Protestants (Aglipayan, Episcopalian, and others), nontrinitarian (Iglesia ni Cristo and Jehovah's Witnesses), Muslims, Buddhist or nonreligious; religion has served as a dividing factor within the Philippines and Filipino American communities.[49]\\r\\nAs Filipinos began to migrate to the United States, Filipino Roman Catholics were often not embraced by their American Catholic brethren, nor were they sympathetic to a Filipino-ized Catholicism. This led to creation of ethnic-specific parishes.[50] The first-ever American Church for Filipinos, San Lorenzo Ruiz Church in New York City, is named after the first saint from the Philippines, San Lorenzo Ruiz. This was officially designated as a church for Filipinos in July 2005, the first in the United States, and the second in the world, after a church in Rome.[51] In 2010, Filipino American Catholics were the largest population of Asian American Catholics, making up more than three fourths of Asian American Catholics.[52]\\r\\nThe number of Filipino restaurants does not reflect the size of the population.[53][54][55] Due to the restaurant business not being a major source of income for the community, few non-Filipinos are familiar with the cuisine.[56] Although American cuisine influenced Philippine cuisine,[57] it has been criticized by non-Filipinos.[58] Even on Oahu where there is a significant Filipino American population,[59] Philippine cuisine is not as noticeable as other Asian cuisines.[60] On television, Philippine cuisine has been criticized, such as on Fear Factor,[61] and praised, such as on Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations,[62] and Bizarre Foods America.[63]\\r\\nFilipino American chefs cook in many fine dining restaurants,[64] including Cristeta Comerford who is the executive chef in the White House,[54] though many do not serve Filipino cuisine in their restaurants.[64] Reasons given for the lack of Philippine cuisine in the U.S. include colonial mentality,[55] lack of a clear identity,[55] a preference for cooking at home[54] and a continuing preference of Filipino Americans for cuisines other than their own.[65] Philippine cuisine remains prevalent among Filipino immigrants,[66] with restaurants and grocery stores catering to the Filipino American community,[53][67] including Jollibee, a Philippines-based fast-food chain.[68]\\r\\nFilipino-Americans, similar to other people of color, undergo experiences that are unique to their own identities. These experiences derive from both the Filipino culture and American cultures individually and the dueling of these identities as well. These stressors, if great enough, can lead Filipino-Americans into suicidal behaviors.[69] Members of the Filipino community learn early on about kapwa, which is defined as interpersonal connectedness or togetherness.[70]\\r\\nWith kapwa, many Filipino-Americans have a strong sense of needing to repay their family members for the opportunities that they have been able to receive. An example of this is a new college graduate feeling the need to find a job that will allow them to financially support their family and themself. This notion comes from utang na loob, defined as a debt that must be repaid to those who have supported the individual.[71]\\r\\nWith kapwa and utang na loob as strong forces enacting on the individual, there is an all or nothing mentality that is being played out. In order to bring success back to ones family, there is a desire to succeed for ones family through living out a familys wants as opposed to ones own true desires.[72] This can manifest as one entering a career path that they are not passionate in, but select in order to help support their family.[73]\\r\\nDespite many of the stressors for these students deriving from family, it also becomes apparent that these are the reasons that these students are resilient. When family conflict rises in Filipino-American families, there is a negative association with suicide attempts.[69] This suggests that though family is a presenting stressor in a Filipino-Americans life, it also plays a role for their resilience.[69] In a study conducted by Yusuke Kuroki, family connectedness, whether defined as positive or negative to each individual, served as one means of lowering suicide attempts.[69]\\r\\nFilipino Americans have traditionally been socially conservative,[74] particularly with \\"second wave\\" immigrants.[75] In the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election Republican president George W. Bush won the Filipino American vote over John Kerry by nearly a two-to-one ratio,[76] which followed strong support in the 2000 election.[77] However, during the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, Filipino Americans voted majority Democratic, with 50% to 58% of the community voting for President Barack Obama and 42% to 46% voting for Senator John McCain.[78][79] The 2008 election marked the first time that a majority of Filipino Americans voted for a Democrat presidential candidate.[80]\\r\\nAccording to the 2012 National Asian American Survey, conducted in September 2012,[81] 45% of Filipinos were independent or nonpartisan, 27% were Republican, and 24% were Democrats.[79] Additionally, Filipino Americans had the largest proportions of Republicans among Asian Americans polled, a position normally held by Vietnamese Americans, leading up to the 2012 election,[81] and had the lowest job approval opinion of Obama among Asian Americans.[81] In a survey of Asian Americans from thirty seven cities conducted by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, it found that of the Filipino American respondents, 65% voted for Obama.[82]\\r\\nDue to scattered living patterns, it is nearly impossible for Filipino American candidates to win an election solely based on the Filipino American vote.[83] Filipino American politicians have increased their visibility over the past few decades. Ben Cayetano, former governor of Hawaii, became the first governor of Filipino descent in the United States. The number of Congress-members of Filipino descent doubled to numbers not reached since 1937, two when the Philippine Islands were represented by non-voting Resident Commissioners, due to the 2000 Senatorial Election. In 2009 three Congress-members claimed at least one-eighth Filipino ethnicity;[84] the largest number to date. Since the resignation of Senator John Ensign in 2011[85] (the only Filipino American to have been a member of the Senate), and Representative Steve Austria (the only Asian Pacific American Republican in the 112th Congress[86]) choosing not to seek reelection and retire,[87] Representative Robert C. Scott is the only Filipino American in the 113th Congress.[88]\\r\\nThe Citizenship Retention and Re-Acquisition Act of 2003 (Republic Act No. 9225) made Filipino Americans eligible for dual citizenship in the United States and the Philippines.[89] Overseas suffrage was first employed in the May 2004 elections in which Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was reelected to a second term.[90]\\r\\nBy 2005, about 6,000 Filipino Americans had become dual citizens of the two countries.[91] This act allow Filipino Americans to invest in the Philippines, through land purchases, which are limited to Filipino citizens and, with some limitations, former citizens.[92]), vote in Philippine elections, retire in the Philippines, and participate in representing the Philippine flag. In 2013, for the Philippine general election there were 125,604 registered Filipino voters in the United States and Caribbean, of which only 13,976 voted.[93]\\r\\nDual citizens have been recruited to participate in international sports events including athletes representing the Philippines who competed in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens,[94] and the Olympic Games in Beijing 2008.[95]\\r\\nThe Philippine government actively encourages Filipino Americans to visit or return permanently to the Philippines via the \\"Balikbayan\\" program and to invest in the country.[96]\\r\\nFilipinos remain one of the largest immigrant groups to date with over 40,000 arriving annually since 1979.[97] The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has a preference system for issuing visas to non-citizen family members of U.S. citizens, with preference based generally on familial closeness. Some non-citizen relatives of U.S. citizens spend long periods on waiting lists.[98] Petitions for immigrant visas, particularly for siblings of previously naturalized Filipinos that date back to 1984, were not granted until 2006.[99] As of 2016[update], over 380 thousand Filipinos were on the visa wait list, second only to Mexico and ahead of India, Vietnam and China.[100] Filipinos have the longest waiting times for family reunification visas, as Filipinos disproportionately apply for family visas; this has led to visa petitions filed in July 1989 still waiting to be processed in March 2013.[101]\\r\\nIt has been documented that Filipinos were among those naturalized due to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.[102] In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that 270,000 Filipino were \\"unauthorized immigrants\\". This was an increase of 70,000 from a previous estimate in 2000. In both years, Filipinos accounted for 2% of the total. As of 2009[update], Filipinos were the fifth-largest community of illegal immigrants behind Mexico (6.65 million, 62%), El Salvador (530,000, 5%), Guatemala (480,000, 4%), and Honduras (320,000, 3%).[103] In January 2011, the Department of Homeland Security estimate of \\"unauthorized immigrants\\" from the Philippines remained at 270,000.[104] Filipinos who reside in the United States illegally are known within the Filipino community as \\"TnT's\\" (tago nang tago translated to \\"hide and hide\\").[105]\\r\\nFilipino Americans may be mistaken for members of other racial/ethnic groups, such as Latinos or Pacific Islanders;[106] this may lead to \\"mistaken\\" discrimination that is not specific to Asian Americans.[106] Filipino Americans additionally, have had difficulty being categorized, termed by one source as being in \\"perpetual absence\\".[107]\\r\\nIn the period, prior to 1946, Filipinos were taught that they were American, and presented with an idealized America.[97] They had official status as United States nationals.[108] When ill-treated and discriminated by other Americans, Filipinos were faced with the racism of that period, which undermined these ideals.[109] Carlos Bulosan later wrote about this experience in America is in the Heart. Even pensionados, who immigrated on government scholarships,[97] were treated poorly.[109]\\r\\nIn Hawaii, Filipino Americans often have little identification with their heritage,[110] and it has been documented that many disclaim their ethnicity.[111] This may be due to the \\"colonial mentality\\", or the idea that Western ideals and physical characteristics are superior to their own.[112] Although categorized as Asian Americans, Filipino Americans have not fully embraced being part of this racial category due to marginalization by other Asian American groups and or the dominant American society.[113] This created a struggle within Filipino American communities over how far to assimilate.[114] The term \\"white-washed\\" has been applied to those seeking to further assimilate.[115] Those who disclaim their ethnicity lose the positive adjustment to outcomes that are found in those who have a strong, positive, ethnic identity.[112]\\r\\nOf the ten largest immigrant groups, Filipino Americans have the highest rate of assimilation.[116] with exception to the cuisine;[117] Filipino Americans have been described as the most \\"Americanized\\" of the Asian American ethnicities.[118] However, even though Filipino Americans are the second largest group among Asian Americans, community activists have described the ethnicity as \\"invisible\\", claiming that the group is virtually unknown to the American public,[119] and is often not seen as significant even among its members.[120]\\r\\nThis description has also been used in the political arena, given the lack of political mobilization.[121] In the mid-1990s it was estimated that some one hundred Filipino Americans have been elected or appointed to public office. This lack of political representation contributes to the perception that Filipino Americans are invisible.[122]\\r\\nThe concept is also used to describe how the ethnicity has assimilated.[123] Few affirmative action programs target the group although affirmative action programs rarely target Asian Americans in general.[124] Assimilation was easier given that the group is majority religiously Christian, fluency in English, and high levels of education.[125] The concept was in greater use in the past, before the post-1965 wave of arrivals.[126]\\r\\nThe term \\"invisible minority\\" has been used to describe Asian Americans as a whole,[127][128] and the term \\"model minority\\" has been applied to Filipinos as well as other Asian American groups.[129] Filipino critics allege that Filipino Americans are ignored in immigration literature and studies.[130]\\r\\nAs with fellow Asian Americans, Filipino Americans are viewed as \\"perpetual foreigners\\", even for those born in the United States.[131] This has resulted in physical attacks on Filipino Americans, as well as non-violent forms of discrimination.[132]\\r\\nFilipino American gay, lesbian, transgender, and bisexual identities are often shaped by immigration status, generation, religion, and racial formation.[133]\\r\\nDuring World War II, some 250,000 to 400,000 Filipinos served in the United States Military,[134][135] in units including the Philippine Scouts, Philippine Commonwealth Army under U.S. Command, and recognized guerrillas during the Japanese Occupation. In January 2013, ten thousand surviving Filipino American veterans of World War II lived in the United States, and a further fourteen thousand in the Philippines,[136] although some estimates found eighteen thousand or fewer surviving veterans.[137]\\r\\nThe U.S. government promised these soldiers all of the benefits afforded to other veterans.[138] However, in 1946, the United States Congress passed the Rescission Act of 1946 which stripped Filipino veterans of the promised benefits. One estimate claims that monies due to these veterans for back pay and other benefits exceeds one billion dollars.[135] Of the sixty-six countries allied with the United States during the war, the Philippines is the only country that did not receive military benefits from the United States.[120] The phrase \\"Second Class Veterans\\" has been used to describe their status.[120][139]\\r\\nMany Filipino veterans traveled to the United States to lobby Congress for these benefits .[140] Since 1993, numerous bills have been introduced in Congress to pay the benefits, but all died in committee.\\r\\nRepresentative Hanabusa submitted legislation to award Filipino Veterans with a Congressional Gold Medal.[141] Known as the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act, it was referred to the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on House Administration.[142] As of February 2012 had attracted 41 cosponsors.[143] In January 2017, the medal was approved.[144]\\r\\nThere was a proposed lawsuit to be filed in 2011 by The Justice for Filipino American Veterans against the Department of Veterans Affairs.[145]\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, efforts towards reinstating benefits first succeeded with the incorporation of Filipino veteran naturalization in the Immigration Act of 1990.[120] Over 30,000 such veterans had immigrated, with mostly American citizens, receiving benefits relating to their service.[146]\\r\\nSimilar language to those bills was inserted by the Senate into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[147] which provided a one time payment of at least 9,000 USD to eligible non-US Citizens and 15,000 USD to eligible US Citizens via the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund.[148] These payments went to those recognized as soldiers or guerrillas or their spouses.[149] The list of eligibles is smaller than the list recognized by the Philippines.[150] Additionally, recipients had to waive all rights to possible future benefits.[151] As of March 2011, 42 percent (24,385) of claims had been rejected;[152] By September 2012, that number was further reduced to some 24 thousand, using the \\"Missouri list\\" (the Approved Revised Reconstructed Guerilla Roster kept by the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) in St Louis, MO.)\\r\\nIn the 113th Congress, Representative Joe Heck reintroduced his legislation to allow documents from the Philippine government and the U.S. Army to be accepted as proof of eligibility.[153] Known as H.R. 481, it was referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.[154] In 2013, the U.S. released a previously classified report detailing guerrilla activities, including guerrilla units not on the \\"Missouri list\\".[155]\\r\\nIn September 2012, the Social Security Administration announced that non-resident Filipino World War II veterans were eligible for certain social security benefits; however an eligible veteran would lose those benefits if they visited for more than one month in a year, or immigrated.[156]\\r\\nCongress established Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in May to commemorate Filipino American and other Asian American cultures. Upon becoming the largest Asian American group in California, October was established as Filipino American History Month to acknowledge the first landing of Filipinos on October 18, 1587 in Morro Bay, California. It is widely celebrated by Fil-Ams.[157][158]\\r\\n\\r\\n1 The U.S. Census Bureau definition of Asians refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent.

It was originally composed as Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata in Bengali by poet Rabindranath Tagore.[1][2] The first stanza of the song Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata in its Hindi version was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the National Anthem on 24 January 1950.[3][4] A formal rendition of the national anthem takes approximately fifty-two seconds. A shortened version consisting of the first and last lines (and taking about 20?seconds to play) is also staged occasionally.[5]  It was first publicly sung on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta (now, Kolkata) Session of the Indian National Congress.[6] This is the first of five stanzas of Tagore's Bengali song Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poem was first sung on the second day of the annual session of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta on December 27, 1911, and again in January 1912 at the annual event of the Adi Brahmo Samaj.[8][9] Though the Bengali song had been written in 1911,[8] it was largely unknown except to the readers of the Adi Brahmo Samaj journal, Tattwabodhini Patrika, of which Tagore was the editor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSong was performed by Sarala Devi Chowdhurani, Tagores niece, along with a group of school students, in front of prominent Congress Members like Bishan Narayan Dhar, Indian National Congress President and Ambika Charan Majumdar. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1912, the song was published under the title Bharat Bhagya Bidhata in the Tatwabodhini Patrika, which was the official publication of the Brahmo Samaj and of which Tagore was the Editor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOutside of Calcutta, the song was first sung by the bard himself at a session in Besant Theosophical College in Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh on February 28, 1919 when Tagore visited the college and sung the song. The song enthralled the college students while Margaret Cousins, then vice-principal of the college (also an expert in European music and wife of Irish poet James Cousins), both requested Tagore to create an English translation of the song and set down the notation to the national anthem, which is followed only when the song is sung in the original slow rendition style. Tagore duly translated the work into English while at the college on February 28, 1919. The college adopted Tagore's translation of the song as their prayer song which is sung till today. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the occasion of India attaining freedom, the Indian Constituent Assembly assembled for the first time as a sovereign body on August 14, 1947, midnight and the session closed with a unanimous performance of Jana Gana Mana.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe members of the Indian Delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations held at New York in 1947 gave a recording of Jana Gana Mana as the countrys national anthem.

Instructions have been issued from time to time about the correct versions of the Anthem, the occasions on which these are to be played or sung, and about the need for paying respect to the anthem by observance of proper decorum on such occasions. The substance of these instructions has been embodied in the information sheet issued by the government of India for general information and guidance.

On 11 August 1986,[17] the Supreme Court reversed the High Court and ruled that the High Court had misdirected itself because the question is not whether a particular religious belief or practice appeals to our reason or sentiment but whether the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held as part of the profession or practice of a religion. \\"Our personal views and reactions are irrelevant\\" The Supreme Court affirmed the principle that it is not for a secular judge to sit in judgment on the correctness of a religious belief.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSupreme Court observed in its ruling[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"There is no provision of law which obliges anyone to sing the National Anthem nor is it disrespectful to the National Anthem if a person who stands up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung does not join the singing. Proper respect is shown to the National Anthem by standing up when the National Anthem is sung. It will not be right to say that disrespect is shown by not joining in the singing. Standing up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung but not singing oneself clearly does not either prevent the singing of the National Anthem or cause disturbance to an assembly engaged in such singing so as to constitute the offence mentioned in s. 3 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 November 2016, Supreme Court of India ordered the National Anthem must be played before movies in theaters, in order to instill \\"committed patriotism and nationalism\\".[20] On February 10, 2017, 2 Kashmiris were booked for not standing during anthem in Jammu Cinema, under provisions of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. This was the first arrest of its kind made by a state government in India.[21][22] In January 2018, the government reversed its stance and requested that the Supreme Court rescind the order until a government panel could consider the issue in more depth; the court agreed, and so around 9 January 2018 the National Anthem ceased being compulsory in movie theaters.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition was first sung during a convention of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta on 27 December 1911.[24] It was sung on the second day of the convention, and the agenda of that day devoted itself to a loyal welcome of George V on his visit to India. The event was reported thus in the British Indian press:\\r\\n\\"The Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore sang a song composed by him specially to welcome the Emperor.\\" (Statesman, Dec. 28, 1911)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The proceedings began with the singing by Rabindranath Tagore of a song specially composed by him in honour of the Emperor.\\" (Englishman, Dec. 28, 1911)\\"When the proceedings of the Indian National Congress began on Wednesday 27th December 1911, a Bengali song in welcome of the Emperor was sung. A resolution welcoming the Emperor and Empress was also adopted unanimously.\\" (Indian, Dec. 29, 1911)\\r\\nMany historians aver that the newspaper reports cited above were misguided. The confusion arose in British Indian press since a different song, \\"Badshah Humara\\" written in Hindi by Rambhuj Chaudhary,[25] was sung on the same occasion in praise of the monarch. The nationalist Indian press stated this difference of events clearly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The proceedings of the Congress party session started with a prayer in Bengali to praise God (song of benediction). This was followed by a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V. Then another song was sung welcoming King George V.\\" (Amrita Bazar Patrika, Dec.28,1911)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\"The annual session of Congress began by singing a song composed by the great Bengali poet Ravindranath Tagore. Then a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V was passed. A song paying a heartfelt homage to King George V was then sung by a group of boys and girls.\\" (The Bengalee, Dec. 28, 1911)\\r\\nEven the report of the annual session of the Indian National Congress of December 1911 stated this difference:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"On the first day of 28th annual session of the Congress, proceedings started after singing Vande Mataram. On the second day the work began after singing a patriotic song by Babu Ravindranath Tagore. Messages from well wishers were then read and a resolution was passed expressing loyalty to King George V. Afterwards the song composed for welcoming King George V and Queen Mary was sung.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 November 1937 Tagore wrote a letter to Mr Pulin Bihari Sen about the controversy. That letter in Bengali can be found in Tagore's biography Ravindrajivani, volume II page 339 by Prabhatkumar Mukherjee.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\"A certain high official in His Majesty's service, who was also my friend, had requested that I write a song of felicitation towards the Emperor. The request simply amazed me. It caused a great stir in my heart. In response to that great mental turmoil, I pronounced the victory in Jana Gana Mana of that Bhagya Bidhata [ed. God of Destiny] of India who has from age after age held steadfast the reins of India's chariot through rise and fall, through the straight path and the curved. That Lord of Destiny, that Reader of the Collective Mind of India, that Perennial Guide, could never be George V, George VI, or any other George. Even my official friend understood this about the song. After all, even if his admiration for the crown was excessive, he was not lacking in simple common sense.\\"[26] \\r\\nAgain in his letter of 19 March 1939 Tagore writes:[27]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I should only insult myself if I cared to answer those who consider me capable of such unbounded stupidity as to sing in praise of George the Fourth or George the Fifth as the Eternal Charioteer leading the pilgrims on their journey through countless ages of the timeless history of mankind.\\"\\r\\n(Purvasa, Phalgun, 1354, p. 738.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, Tagore was hailed as a patriot who wrote other songs too apart from \\"Jana Gana Mana\\" lionising the Indian independence movement. He renounced his knighthood in protest against the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. The Knighthood (i.e. the title of 'Sir') was conferred on him by the same King George V after receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature for \\"Gitanjali\\" from the government of Sweden. Two of Tagore's more politically charged compositions, \\"Chitto Jetha Bhayshunyo\\" (\\"Where the Mind is Without Fear\\", Gitanjali Poem #35) and \\"Ekla Chalo Re\\" (\\"If They Answer Not to Thy Call, Walk Alone\\"), gained mass appeal, with the latter favoured by Gandhi and Netaji.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother controversy is that only those provinces that were under British rule, i.e. Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat, Maratha, Dravid (South India), Odisha/Utkal and Bengal, were mentioned. None of the princely states ÿ Kashmir, Rajasthan, Hyderabad, Mysore or Kerala ÿ or the states in Northeast India, which are now integral parts of India were mentioned. But opponents of this proposition claim that Tagore mentioned only the border states of India to include complete India. Whether the princely states would form a part of a liberated Indian republic was a matter of debate even till Indian Independence. 'Dravida' includes the people from the south (though Dravida specifically means Tamil and even then, the same consideration is not given for the south since there are many distinct people whereas in the north each of the distinct people are named) and 'Jolodhi' (Stanza 1) is Sanskrit for \\"seas and oceans\\". Even North-East which was under British rule or holy rivers apart from Ganges and Yamuna are not mentioned to keep the song in its rhythm. India has 29 states, 7 union territories.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, there were calls to delete the word \\"Sindh\\" and substitute it with the word Kashmir. The argument was that Sindh was no longer a part of India, having become part of Pakistan as a result of the Partition of 1947. Opponents of this proposal hold that the word \\"Sindh\\" refers to the Indus and to Sindhi culture, and that Sindhi people are an integral part of India's cultural fabric. The Supreme Court of India declined to change the national anthem and the wording remains unchanged.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 December 2013, MLA of Assam, Phani Bhushan Choudhury cited article of 'The Times of India' published on 26 January 1950, stating that originally the word 'Kamarup' was included in the song, but was later changed to 'Sindhu' and claimed that Kamarup should be re-included.[28] To this, the then minister Rockybul Hussain replied that the state government would initiate steps in this regard after response from the newspaper.[28] The debate was further joined by the then minister Ardhendu Dey, mentioning 'Sanchayita' (edited by Tagore himself) etc. where he said Kamrup was not mentioned.[28]","input":"When was the indian national anthem first sung?"},{"output":"over 6 million","context":"\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album A Night at the Opera. It is a six-minute suite,[1] consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda.[2] The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre.[3] It was reportedly the most expensive single ever made at the time of its release, although the exact cost of production cannot be determined.[4]\\r\\nWhen it was released as a single, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" became a commercial success, staying at the top of the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and selling more than a million copies by the end of January 1976.[5] It reached number one again in 1991 for another five weeks when the same version was re-released following Mercury's death,[6] eventually becoming the UK's third-best-selling single of all time.[7] It is also the only song to be the UK Christmas number one twice by the same artist.[8] It topped the charts in several other markets as well, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and The Netherlands, later becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time selling over 6 million copies worldwide. In the United States, the song originally peaked at number nine in 1976. It returned to the chart at number two in 1992, and also appeared in the film Wayne's World, which contributed to the revival of its American popularity.\\r\\nAlthough critical reaction was initially mixed, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" remains one of Queen's most popular songs and is frequently placed on modern lists of the greatest songs of all time. The single was accompanied by a promotional video, which many scholars consider ground-breaking.[9] Rolling Stone stated that its influence \\"cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air.\\"[10] The Guardian ranked the music video for \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" number 31 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history, adding it ensured \\"videos would henceforth be a mandatory tool in the marketing of music\\".[11]\\r\\nIn 2004, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[12] In 2012, the song topped the list on an ITV nationwide poll in the UK to find \\"The Nation's Favourite Number One\\" over 60 years of music,[13] while Mercury's vocal performance was chosen as the greatest in rock history by readers of Rolling Stone.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFreddie Mercury wrote \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" at his home in London.[15] The song's producer, Roy Thomas Baker, related how Mercury once played the opening ballad section on the piano for him: \\"He played the beginning on the piano, then stopped and said, 'And this is where the opera section comes in!' Then we went out to eat dinner.\\" Guitarist Brian May says the band thought that Mercury's blueprint for the song was \\"intriguing and original, and worthy of work\\".[16] According to May, much of Queen's material was written in the studio, but this song \\"was all in Freddie's mind\\" before they started.[15]\\r\\nMusic scholar Sheila Whiteley suggests that \\"the title draws strongly on contemporary rock ideology, the individualism of the bohemian artists' world, with rhapsody affirming the romantic ideals of art rock\\".[17] Commenting on bohemianism, Judith Peraino said \\"Mercury intended?... [this song] to be a 'mock opera', something outside the norm of rock songs, and it does follow a certain operatic logic: choruses of multi-tracked voices alternate with aria-like solos, the emotions are excessive, the plot confusing.\\"[18]\\r\\nAccording to Mercury's friend Chris Smith (a keyboard player in Smile), Mercury first started developing \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" in the late 1960s; Mercury used to play parts of songs he was writing at the piano, and one of his pieces, known simply as \\"The Cowboy Song\\", contained lyrics that ended up in the completed version produced years later, in 1975, specifically, \\"Mama?... just killed a man.\\"[19] This echoes the opener of a 1962 b-side called Mama by Roy Orbison, which is also on Roy Orbison's Greatest Hits (1962).\\r\\nRecording began on 24 August 1975 at Rockfield Studio 1 near Monmouth, South Wales, after a three-week rehearsal at Penrhos Court, near Kington, Herefordshire. During the making of the track, four additional studios (Roundhouse, Sarm East Studios, Scorpion, and Wessex Sound Studios) were used.[4] According to some band members, Mercury mentally prepared the song beforehand and directed the band throughout.[15] Mercury used a Bechstein \\"concert grand\\" piano, which he played in the promotional video and the UK tour. Due to the elaborate nature of the song, it was recorded in various sections.[20]\\r\\nMay, Mercury, and drummer Roger Taylor reportedly sang their vocal parts continually for ten to twelve hours a day.[15] The entire piece took three weeks to record, and in some sections featured 180 separate overdubs.[20] Since the studios of the time only offered 24-track analog tape, it was necessary for the three to overdub themselves many times and \\"bounce\\" these down to successive sub-mixes. In the end, eighth-generation tapes were used.[4] The various sections of tape containing the desired sub-mixes had to be spliced (cut and assembled in the correct sequence). May recalled placing a tape in front of the light and being able to see through it, as the tape had been used so many times.[21]\\r\\nProducer Baker recalls that May's solo was done on only one track, rather than recording multiple tracks. May stated that he wanted to compose \\"a little tune that would be a counterpart to the main melody; I didn't just want to play the melody\\". The guitarist said that his better material stems from this way of working: in which he thought of the tune before playing it: \\"the fingers tend to be predictable unless being led by the brain.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" has been affiliated to several genres of music, including progressive rock/symphonic rock,[3][22][23][24] hard rock,[25][26] and progressive pop.[27] The song is highly unusual for a popular single in featuring no chorus, combining disparate musical styles and containing lyrics which eschew conventional love-based narratives for allusions to murder and nihilism.[2] It consists of sections, beginning with an introduction, then a piano ballad, before a guitar solo leads to an operatic interlude. A hard rock part follows this and it concludes with a coda. The song is in the keys of B? major, E? major, A major and F major, and shifts from a 9\\r\\n8 metre in the introduction to 4\\r\\n4.[28] This musical format of writing a song as a suite with changes in style, tone and tempo throughout was uncommon in most mainstream pop and rock music but common in progressive rock. The genre had reached its artistic and commercial zenith between 1970 and 1975 in the music of British bands such as Jethro Tull, Yes, Genesis, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Gentle Giant, Van der Graaf Generator and Curved Air.[29] The music of progressive rock was characterised by dramatic contrasts, frequent shifts in tempo and in rhythmic character from one section of a composition to the next.[30] Bands from the genre had blended rock with classical music, its structural features and compositional practices, as well as using classical music instrumentation.[31] Queen had embraced progressive rock as one of their many diverse influences.[32] \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" parodies many different elements of opera by using bombastic choruses, sarcastic recitative and distorted Italian operatic phraseology.[33] An embryonic version of this style had already been utilised in Mercury's earlier compositions for the band \\"My Fairy King\\" (1973) and \\"The March of the Black Queen\\" (1974).\\r\\nThe song begins with a close five-part harmony a cappella introduction in B? majorentirely multi track recordings of Mercury although the video has all four members lip-syncing this part. The lyrics question whether life is \\"real\\" or \\"just fantasy caught in a landslide\\" before concluding that there can be \\"no escape from reality\\".\\r\\nAfter 20 seconds, the grand piano enters, and Mercury's voice alternates with the other vocal parts. The narrator introduces himself as \\"just a poor boy\\" but declares that he \\"needs no sympathy\\" because he is \\"easy come, easy go\\" and then \\"little high, little low\\" (if listening in stereo, the words \\"little high\\" come from the left speaker whereas the \\"little low\\" comes from the right); chromatic side-slipping on \\"easy come, easy go\\" highlights the dream-like atmosphere. The end of this section is marked by the bass entrance and the cross-handed piano vamp in B?.\\r\\nThe piano begins the vamp in B? major along with the entrance of John Deacon's bass guitar, marking the onset of this section. After it plays twice, Mercury's vocals enter. Over the course of the section, the vocals evolve from a softly sung harmony to an impassioned solo performance by Mercury. The narrator explains to his mother that he has \\"just killed a man,\\" with \\"a gun against his head\\" and in doing so, has thrown his life away. This \\"confessional\\" section, Whiteley comments, is \\"affirmative of the nurturant and life-giving force of the feminine and the need for absolution\\".[17] The bassline brings about a modulation to E? major, underpinning the mood of desperation.[17] It is at this point (1:19) that Taylor's drums enter (this features the 1-1-2 rhythm of \\"We Will Rock You\\" in ballad form), and the narrator makes the second of several invocations to his \\"mama\\" in the new key, reusing the original theme. The narrator explains his regret over \\"mak[ing] you cry\\" and urging mama to \\"carry on as if nothing really matters\\". A brief, descending variation of the piano vamp phrase connects to a two repeat of the vamp in B? major once again, ushering in the second verse.\\r\\nAs the ballad proceeds into its second verse, the narrator shows how tired and beaten down he is by his actions (as May enters on guitar and mimics the upper range of the piano at 1:50). May imitates a bell tree during the line \\"sends shivers down my spine\\", by playing the strings of his guitar on the other side of the bridge. The narrator bids the world goodbye announcing he has \\"got to go\\" and prepares to \\"face the truth\\" admitting \\"I don't want to die / I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.\\" This is where the guitar solo enters.\\r\\nTowards the end of the ballad section, the band builds in intensity, incorporating a guitar solo (in E? major) played and composed by May. The intensity continues to build, but once the bass line completes its descent establishing modulation to the new key (A major), the entire band cuts out abruptly at 3:03 except for quiet, staccato A major quaver (eighth-note) chords on the piano, marking the start of the \\"Opera\\" section.\\r\\nA rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano and Timpani. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes. According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury and himself combined created a wide vocal range: \\"Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff.\\" The band wanted to create \\"a wall of sound, that starts down and goes all the way up\\".[15] The band used the bell effect for lyrics \\"Magnifico\\" and \\"Let me go\\". Also, on \\"Let him go\\", Taylor singing the top section carries his note on further after the rest of the \\"choir\\" have stopped singing.\\r\\nLyrical references in this passage include Scaramouche, the fandango, Galileo Galilei, Figaro, Beelzebub and Bismillah, as rival factions fight over the narrator's soul. The section concludes with a full choral treatment of the lyric \\"Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me!\\", on a block B? major chord. Roger Taylor tops the final chord with a falsetto B? in the fifth octave (B?5).\\r\\nUsing the 24-track technology available at the time, the \\"opera\\" section took about three weeks to finish.[16] Producer Roy Thomas Baker said \\"Every time Freddie came up with another 'Galileo', I would add another piece of tape to the reel.\\"[4] Baker recalls that they kept wearing out the tape, which meant having to do transfers.[16]\\r\\nThe operatic section leads into a rock interlude with a guitar riff written by Mercury. At 4:15, a quadruple-tracked Mercury (in stereo, the four parts are panned two on the left and two on the right) sings angry lyrics addressed to an unspecified \\"you\\", accusing them of betrayal and abuse and insisting \\"can't do this to me, baby\\". Three ascending guitar runs follow. Mercury then plays a similar B? run on the piano, as the song builds up to the finale with a ritardando.\\r\\nAfter Mercury plays ascending octaves of notes from the B? mixolydian mode (composed of the notes from the E? scale), the song then returns to the tempo and form of the introduction, initially in E? major, before quickly modulating to C minor, only to soon go through an abrupt short series of modulations, bringing it back to C minor again in time for the final \\"nothing really matters\\" section. A guitar accompanies the chorus \\"ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah.\\" A double-tracked twin guitar melody is played through an amplifier designed by John Deacon, affectionately nicknamed the \\"Deacy Amp\\". Mercury's line \\"Nothing really matters...\\" appears again, \\"cradled by light piano arpeggios suggesting both resignation (minor tonalities) and a new sense of freedom in the wide vocal span\\".[34] After the line \\"nothing really matters\\" is repeated multiple times, the song finally concludes in the key of E? major, but then changes again to F major just before it ends. The final line, \\"Any way the wind blows\\", is followed by the quiet sound of a large tam-tam that finally expels the tension built up throughout the song.\\r\\nThe New York Times commented that \\"the song's most distinct feature is the fatalistic lyrics\\". Mercury refused to explain his composition other than saying it was about relationships; the band is still protective of the song's secret.[16] Brian May supports suggestions that the song contained veiled references to Mercury's personal traumas. He recalls \\"Freddie was a very complex person: flippant and funny on the surface, but he concealed insecurities and problems in squaring up his life with his childhood. He never explained the lyrics, but I think he put a lot of himself into that song.\\"[35] May, though, says the band had agreed that the core of a lyric was a private issue for the composer.[16] In a BBC Three documentary about the making of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", Roger Taylor maintains that the true meaning of the song is \\"fairly self-explanatory with just a bit of nonsense in the middle\\".[15]\\r\\nWhen the band released a Greatest Hits cassette in Iran, a leaflet in Persian was included with translation and explanations (refers to a book published in Iran called The March of the Black Queen by Sarah Sefati and Farhad Arkani, which included the whole biography of the band and complete lyrics with Persian translation (2000)). In the explanation, Queen states that \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" is about a young man who has accidentally killed someone and, like Faust, sold his soul to the devil. On the night before his execution, he calls for God saying, \\"Bismillah\\" (\\"In the name of God\\" in Arabic), and with the help of angels, regains his soul from Shaitan (the devil in Islam).[37]\\r\\nDespite this, critics, both journalistic and academic, have speculated over the meaning behind the song's lyrics. Some believe the lyrics describe a suicidal murderer haunted by demons or depict events just preceding an execution. The latter explanation points to Albert Camus's novel The Stranger, in which a young man confesses to an impulsive murder and has an epiphany before he is executed, as probable inspiration. Others believe the lyrics were only written to fit with the music, and have no meaning; Kenny Everett quoted Mercury as claiming the lyrics were simply \\"random rhyming nonsense\\".[35]\\r\\nStill, others interpreted them as Mercury's way of dealing with personal issues.[16] Music scholar Sheila Whiteley observes that Mercury reached a turning point in his personal life in the year he wrote \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".[17] He had been living with Mary Austin for seven years but had just embarked on his first love affair with a man. She suggests that the song provides an insight into Mercury's emotional state at the time, \\"living with Mary ('Mamma', as in Mother Mary) and wanting to break away ('Mamma Mia let me go')\\".[34]\\r\\nWhen the band wanted to release the single in 1975, various executives suggested to them that, at 5 minutes and 55 seconds, it was too long and would never be a hit.[38] The song was played to other musicians who commented the band had no hope of it ever being played on radio.[15] According to producer Roy Thomas Baker, he and the band bypassed this corporate decision by playing the song for Capital Radio DJ Kenny Everett: \\"we had a reel-to-reel copy but we told him he could only have it if he promised not to play it. 'I won't play it,' he said, winking...\\"[4] Their plan worked?ÿ Everett teased his listeners by playing only parts of the song. Audience demand intensified when Everett played the full song on his show 14 times in two days.[16] Hordes of fans attempted to buy the single the following Monday, only to be told by record stores that it had not yet been released.[4] The same weekend, Paul Drew, who ran the RKO stations in the States, heard the track on Everett's show in London. Drew managed to get a copy of the tape and started to play it in the States, which forced the hand of Queen's US label, Elektra. In an interview with Sound on Sound, Baker reflects that \\"it was a strange situation where radio on both sides of the Atlantic was breaking a record that the record companies said would never get airplay!\\"[4] Eventually the unedited single was released, with \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" as the B-side. Following Everett's escapade in October 1975, Eric Hall, a well known record plugger, gave a copy to David \\"Diddy\\" Hamilton to play on his weekday Radio One show. Eric stated \\"Monster, Monster! This could be a hit!\\"[39]\\r\\nThe song became the 1975 UK Christmas number one, holding the top position for nine weeks.[34] \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was the first song ever to get to number one in the UK twice with the same version,[40] and is also the only single to have been Christmas number one twice with the same version. The second was upon its re-release (as a double A-side single with \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\\") in 1991 following Mercury's death, staying at number one for five weeks.\\r\\nIn the United States, the single was also a success, although to a lesser extent than in the UK. The single, released in December 1975, reached number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of one million copies.[41] A re-release in 1992 (popularized by the song's appearance in the hit film Wayne's World) reached number two. In a retrospective interview, Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone explains the song's relatively poor performance in the US charts by saying that it's \\"the quintessential example of the kind of thing that doesn't exactly go over well in America\\".[15] Its chart run of 24 weeks, however, placed it at number 18 on Billboard's year-end chart, higher than some number ones of the year.[42] In its 1992 chart resurgence, it lasted 17 weeks on the chart and peaked at number two, with a year-end chart position of 39. It was certified gold by the RIAA a second time on 8 August 2005 for digital download sales over 100,000, and quadruple platinum on 23 April 2014 for combined digital sales and streams.[41] It has sold 4.4 million digital copies in the US as of September 2017[update].[43] With the Canadian record-buying public, the single fared better, reaching number one in the RPM national singles chart for the week ending 1 May 1976.[44]\\r\\nThough some artists had made video clips to accompany songs (including Queen themselves; for example, \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\", \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\", \\"Killer Queen\\" and \\"Liar\\" already had \\"pop promos\\", as they were known at the time), it was only after the success of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" that it became regular practice for record companies to produce promotional videos for artists' single releases.[45] These videos could then be shown on television shows, such as the BBC's Top of the Pops, without the need for the artist to appear in person. A promo video also allowed the artist to have their music broadcast and accompanied by their own choice of visuals, rather than dancers such as Pan's People. According to May, the video was produced so that the band could avoid miming on Top of the Pops, since they would have looked off miming to such a complex song.[35] He also said that the band knew they would be set to appear at Dundee's Caird Hall on tour and unable to appear on the programme anyway.[15] The video has been hailed as launching the MTV age.[15]\\r\\nThe band used Trillion, a subsidiary of Trident Studios, their former management Company and recording studio. They hired one of their trucks and got it to Elstree Studios, where the band were rehearsing for their tour. The video was directed by Bruce Gowers, who had directed a video of the band's 1974 performance at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and was recorded by cameraman Barry Dodd and assistant director/floor manager Jim McCutcheon. The video was recorded in just four hours on 10 November 1975, at a cost of S4,500.[20] Gowers reported that the band was involved in the discussion of the video and the end result, and \\"was a co-operative to that extent, but there was only one leader.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe video opens with a shot of the four band members in near darkness as they sing the a cappella part. The lights fade up, and the shots cross-fade into close-ups of Freddie. The composition of the shot is the same as Mick Rock's cover photograph for their second album Queen II. The photo, inspired by a photograph of actress Marlene Dietrich, was the band's favourite image of themselves.[15] The video then fades into them playing their instruments. In the opera section of the video, the scene reverts to the Queen II standing positions, after which they perform once again on stage during the hard rock segment. In the closing seconds of the video Roger Taylor is depicted stripped to the waist, striking the tam tam in the manner of the trademark of the Rank Organisation's Gongman, familiar in the UK as the opening of all Rank film productions.\\r\\nAll of the special effects were achieved during the recording, rather than editing. The visual effect of Mercury's face cascading away (during the echoed line \\"go\\") was accomplished by pointing the camera at a monitor, giving visual feedback, a glare analogous to audio feedback. The honeycomb illusion was created using a shaped lens. The video was edited within five hours because it was due to be broadcast the same week in which it was taped. The video was sent to the BBC as soon as it was completed and aired for the first time on Top of the Pops in November 1975.[15] After a few weeks at number one, an edit of the video was created. The most obvious difference is the flames superimposed over the introduction as well as several alternate camera angles.\\r\\nAlthough the song has become one of the most revered in popular music history,[46] the initial critical reaction was mixed. The UK music papers reacted with bemusement, recognising that the song was original and technically accomplished, but they mostly remained indifferent. Pete Erskine of NME observed that \\"It'll be interesting to see whether it'll be played in its entirety on the radio. It's performed extremely well, but more in terms of production than anything else... Someone somewhere has decided that the boys' next release must sound 'epic'. And it does. They sound extremely self-important.\\"[47] In Melody Maker Allan Jones was unimpressed, describing the song as \\"a superficially impressive pastiche of incongruous musical styles\\" and that Queen \\"contrived to approximate the demented fury of the Balham Amateur Operatic Society performing The Pirates of Penzance... 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is full of drama, passion and romance and sounds rather like one of those mini-opera affairs that Pete Townsend [sic] used to tack on to the end of Who albums\\", before concluding, \\"The significance of the composition eludes me totally, though I must admit to finding it horrifically fascinating. It's likely to be a hit of enormous proportions despite its length.\\"[48] Ray Fox-Cumming of Record Mirror was also left unmoved, saying, \\"It has no immediate selling point whatsoever: among its many parts. there's scarcely a shred of a tune and certainly no one line to latch onto. There's no denying that it's devilishly clever, encompassing everything from bits of operatic harmonies to snatches that sound like Sparks and David Cassidy, but, in the end the whole adds up to less than the sum of its parts.\\" He did, however, admit that it was \\"unthinkable\\" that it wouldn't be a hit.[49] The most positive review came from Sounds, which called it \\"impossibly disjointed and complex, but a dazzlingly clever epic from the fevered mind of Freddie Mercury\\".[50]\\r\\nIn terms of execution, the song is preceded by the Beach Boys' 1966 single \\"Good Vibrations\\", which was also pieced together using various different sections.[51] \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was praised by Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson, who in 1976 called it \\"the most competitive thing that's come along in ages\\" and \\"a fulfillment and an answer to a teenage prayerof artistic music\\".[52] Greg Lake, whose song \\"I Believe in Father Christmas\\" was kept from number one in the UK by \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" when it was released in 1975, acknowledged that he was \\"beaten by one of the greatest records ever made\\", describing it as \\"a once-in-a-lifetime recording\\".[53]\\r\\nAddressing the song's enduring popularity, author and music lecturer Jochen Eisentraut wrote in 2012: \\"A year before punk made it unfashionable, progressive rock had an astounding success with the theoretically over-length (nearly 6-minute) single 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which bore many of the hallmarks of the 'prog' genre\\". He said it was \\"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\\", it was \\"more accessible than other music of the genre\\" and was \\"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\\".[3] Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \\"remarkable\\" single and said it \\"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\\", suggesting the song \\"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\\".[46] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide described it as \\"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted novelty song ever recorded\\".[54] Writing for the BBC in 2015, the Chicago Tribune's music critic Greg Kot called it a \\"prog-rock pocket operetta\\" and said the song's \\"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude?ÿ one that has resonated across generations\\".[22]\\r\\nIn 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \\"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\\":\\r\\nThe precedents of Bohemian Rhapsody are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries?ÿ like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt?ÿ as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975. That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles?ÿ from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda?ÿ are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense. It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart. And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.[2]\\r\\nComparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist. They observed both songs were \\"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\\", with the notable distinction being \\"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\\". They said \\"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\\".[25]\\r\\nIn 2015, The Economist described it as \\"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\\". It wrote \\"though Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and The Beatles' Paul McCartney had experimented with symphonic elements, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Pete Townshend of The Who had created narrative albums with distinct 'movements', none had had the audacity to import a miniature opera into rock music.\\"[26]\\r\\nThe song has won numerous awards, and has been covered and parodied by many artists. In 1977 \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus and Best Arrangement for Voices. In 1977, only two years after its release, the British Phonographic Industry named \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" as the best British single of the period 1952ÿ77.[55] It is a regular entry in greatest-songs polls, and it was named by the Guinness Book of Records in 2002 as the top British single of all time.[16] The song is also listed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.[56]\\r\\nThe song also came in tenth in a BBC World Service poll to find the world's favourite song.[57] In 2000 it came second to \\"Imagine\\" by John Lennon in a Channel 4 television poll of The 100 Best Number 1s. It has been in the top 5 of the Dutch annual \\"Top 100 Aller Tijden\\" (\\"All-Time Top 100 [Singles]\\") since 1977, reaching number one on eight occasions, more than any other artist.[58] In 1999, the annual \\"Top 2000\\" poll commenced to find the best songs ever made, and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" has been ranked number one in all but four years (2005, 2010, 2014 and 2015 when it was number two).[59] In a 2012 readers poll conducted by Rolling Stone, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was voted the best vocal performance in rock history.[60]\\r\\nIn 2004 the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[12] As of 2004[update], \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" is the second most played song on British radio, in clubs and on jukeboxes collectively, after Procol Harum's \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\".[61] On 30 September 2007 on the Radio 1 Chart Show, for BBC Radio 1's 40th birthday, it was revealed that \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was the most played song since Radio 1's launch. In 2004, BBC Three featured the song as part of their The Story of... series of documentaries dedicated to specific songs. First broadcast in December 2004, the programme charted the history of the song, discussed its credentials, and took Roger Taylor and Brian May of Queen back to one of the studios in which it was recorded. In 2012, the song topped an ITV poll in the UK to find \\"The Nation's Favourite Number One\\" over 60 years of music, ahead of Michael Jackson's \\"Billie Jean\\" (No. 2), Adele's \\"Someone like You\\" (No. 3), Oasis' \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" (No. 4) and The Beatles' \\"Hey Jude\\" (No. 5).[13] The song was also ranked #5 in RadioMafia's list of \\"Top 500 Songs\\".[62] The song was also included in the music video games Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock and Rock Band 3. The song was featured in the second trailer and the ending of the 2016 film Suicide Squad, and appears on the soundtrack album for the film, covered by American band Panic! at the Disco.[63]\\r\\nThe song enjoyed renewed popularity in 1992 due to its inclusion in the soundtrack to the film Wayne's World. \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was re-released as a double A-side cassette single with \\"The Show Must Go On\\" in January 1992 to commemorate the death of Freddie Mercury, with proceeds going to the Magic Johnson Foundation for AIDS research. Following the release of the film and soundtrack album in February, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart after 16 years, reaching number two.\\r\\nThe film's director, Penelope Spheeris, was hesitant to use the song, as it did not entirely fit with the lead characters, who were fans of less flamboyant hard rock and heavy metal. Mike Myers insisted that the song fit the scene.[64]\\r\\nAccording to music scholar Theodore Gracyk, by 1992, when the film was released, even \\"classic rock\\" stations had stopped playing the almost-six-minute song. Gracyk suggests that beginning the tape in the middle of the song after \\"the lyrics which provide the song's narrative ... forces the film's audience to respond to its presence in the scene without the 'commentary' of the lyrics\\".[55] Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.[65]\\r\\nIn connection with this, a new video was released, intercutting excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band. Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from Wayne's World with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band. He said, \\"they've just whizzed on a Picasso.\\" He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea, and that he apologised to them. The band, though, sent a reply simply saying, \\"Thank you for using our song.\\" This shocked Myers, who said it should be more like him telling Queen, \\"Thank you for even letting me touch the hem of your garments!\\"[66]\\r\\nThe Wayne's World video version of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" won Queen its only MTV Video Music Award for \\"Best Video from a Film\\".[67] When remaining members Brian May and Roger Taylor took the stage to accept the award, Brian May was overcome with emotion and said that \\"Freddie would be tickled.\\" In the final scene of said video, a pose of the band from the video from the original \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" clip morphs into an identically posed 1985 photo, first featured in the \\"One Vision\\" video.\\r\\nThe song was also featured in the movie Loaded Weapon 1 in a scene parodying Wayne's World.\\r\\nTo mark the 40th anniversary of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", the song was released on a limited edition 12\\" vinyl with the original B-side \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\" on 27 November 2015 for Record Store Day 2015. Queen also released A Night At The Odeon, Live At Hammersmith 75, on CD, DVD & Blu-ray. This includes the first live \\"professionally\\" recorded performance of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".[68] However, the very first recording and live performance of Bohemian Rhapsody was the performance on 14th of November 1975 in Liverpool. [69]\\r\\nThe a cappella opening was too complex to perform live, so Mercury tried various ways of introducing the song. When the song \\"Mustapha\\" became a live favourite, Mercury would often sub in that song's a cappella opening, which was easier to reproduce live as it was only one voice. During the Hot Space Tour, and occasionally at other times, Mercury would do a piano improvisation (generally the introduction to \\"Death on Two Legs\\") that ended with the first notes of the song. Often, the preceding song would end, and Mercury would sit at the piano, say a quick word and start playing the ballad section.\\r\\nInitially following the song's release, the operatic middle section proved a problem for the band. Because of extensive multi-tracking, it could not be performed on stage. The band did not have enough of a break between the Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night. The opening and closing ballads were played as part of a medley, with \\"Killer Queen\\" and \\"March of the Black Queen\\" taking the place of the operatic and hard rock sections. In 1976 concerts where the same medley was played, the operatic section from the album would be played from tape as the introduction to the setlist. During this playback, Mercury would appear briefly to sing live for the line, \\"I see a little sillhouetto of a man\\".[70] As the song segued into the hard rock section, the band would emerge on the smoke filled stage?ÿ the playback would end at this point, and the hard rock section would be performed live (without the final ballad section, which appeared later in the set).\\r\\nStarting with the A Day at the Races Tour in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live. The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after Brian May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section. A blast of pyrotechnics after Roger Taylor's high note on the final \\"for me\\" would announce the band's return for the hard rock section and closing ballad. Queen played the song in this form all through the Magic Tour of 1986. This style was also used for the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, with Elton John singing the opening ballad and then after the taped operatic section, Axl Rose singing the hard rock section. John and Rose sang the closing ballad part together in a duet.\\r\\n\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was performed by Queen + Paul Rodgers throughout their tours, accompanied by a video of Mercury.[71] Footage from the Live at Wembley '86 was used for the 2005/6 tour, and the 1981 Montreal performance used for the Rock the Cosmos Tour. As with the Queen tours, the band went backstage for the operatic section, which was accompanied by a video tribute to Freddie Mercury. When the hard rock section began, the lights came back up to the full band on stage, including Rodgers, who took over lead vocals. Rodgers duetted with the recording of Mercury for the \\"outro\\" section, allowing the audience to sing the final \\"Nothing really matters to me\\", while the taped Mercury took a bow for the crowd. Rodgers would then repeat the line, and the final line (\\"Any way the wind blows\\") was delivered with one last shot of Mercury smiling at the audience. Commenting upon this staging, Brian May says that they \\"had to rise to the challenge of getting Freddie in there in a way which gave him his rightful place, but without demeaning Paul in any way. It also kept us live and 'present', although conscious and proud of our past, as we logically should be.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was performed by Queen + Adam Lambert on Queen & Adam Lambert Rock Big Ben Live, with a different live version which has never been done before?ÿ the opening ballad was shared between Lambert & Mercury, then after May's guitar solo, instead of the normal light show while the opera section was played from a tape, the band stayed on and performed \\"Killer Queen\\" instead. At the end of \\"Killer Queen\\", the band performed the rock and outro sections of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\n Since May 2013 RIAA certifications for digital singles include on-demand audio and/or video song streams in addition to downloads.[104]\\r\\nI'm going to shatter some illusions, it was just one of those pieces I wrote for the album: just writing my batch of songs. In its early stages I almost rejected it, but then it grew. We started deciding on a single about halfway through. There were a few contenders?ÿ we were thinking of \\"The Prophet's Song\\" at one point?ÿ but then \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" seemed the one. There was a time when the others wanted to chop it around a bit, but I refused. If it was going to be released, it would be in its entirety. We knew it was very risky, but we had so much confidence in that song?ÿ I did anyway. I felt, underneath it all, that if it was successful it would earn a lot of respect. People were all going, You're joking, they'll never play it, you'll only hear the first few bars and then they'll fade it out. We had numerous rows. EMI were shocked?ÿ a six-minute single? You must be joking! The same in America?ÿ oh, you just got away with it in Britain.[105]\\r\\nWhen we finished the album, the Night at the Opera album, that was the track on it that we thought we were gonna release as a single in the UK first. And when we released it in Britain we didn't necessarily think it'd be released in America, cause we know even over here, you know, the AM tastes are even more [hesitates] stricter. Anyway we did have thoughts about even in the UK, perhaps editing it down at all, but we listened to it over and over again and there was no way we could edit it. We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in. And luckily it took off anyway.\\r\\nThe vocal harmonies was something we wanted to do from the beginning, as we are always keen to do that kind of thing. We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock, but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place. We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination. The guitar solo was pretty much off the cuff, except I think I had plenty of time to think about that one. I remember playing along with it in the studio for a while when other things were being done. I knew what kind of melody I wanted to play.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen +","input":"How many copies of bohemian rhapsody were sold?"},{"output":"Mumbai","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nTaarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah (English: Taarak Mehta's Inverted Spectacles) is one of the India's longest running sitcoms.[2] It is produced by Neela Tele Films Private Limited.

Whatever the nature of the problem that a member of the society encounters, all the other members stand by them to extend every possible help.

Usually, the group becomes a nuisance for the other members of the society because of their mischief, while at other times, it draws praises from the members by doing something laudable. The society secretary, Atmaram Tukaram Bhide is especially annoyed with the Tapu Sena for playing cricket in the society compound as sometimes they break the window glasses, or just cause a problem as shown in some episodes.

It is the world's largest delta and empties into the Bay of Bengal the combined waters of several river systems, mainly those of the Brahmaputra river and the Ganges river. It is also one of the most fertile regions in the world, thus earning the nickname The Green Delta. The delta stretches from the Hooghly River on the west to the Meghna River on the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ganges Delta has the shape of a triangle and is considered to be an \\"arcuate\\" (arc-shaped) delta. It covers more than 105,000?km2 (41,000?sq?mi), and although the delta lies mostly in Bangladesh and India, rivers from Bhutan, Tibet, India, and Nepal drain into it from the north. Approximately 60% of the delta is in Bangladesh and, 40% in West Bengal, India. Most of the delta is composed of alluvial soils made up by small sediment particles that finally settle down as river currents slow down in the estuary. Rivers carry these fine particles with them, even from their sources at glaciers as fluvio-glacial. Red and red-yellow laterite soils are found as one heads farther east. The soil has large amounts of minerals and nutrients, which is good for agriculture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is composed of a labyrinth of channels, swamps, lakes, and flood plain sediments (chars). The Gorai-Madhumati River, one of the distributaries of the Ganges, divides the Ganges Delta into two parts: the geologically young, active, eastern delta, and the older, less active, western delta.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 125 and 143 million people live on the delta,[citation needed] despite risks from floods caused by monsoons, heavy runoff from the melting snows of the Himalayas, and North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones. A large part of the nation of Bangladesh lies in the Ganges Delta, and many of the country's people depend on the delta for survival.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is believed that upwards of 300 million people are supported by the Ganges Delta, and approximately 400?million people live in the Ganges River Basin, making it the most populous river basin in the world. Most of the Ganges Delta has a population density of more than 200 people per km2 (520 people per square mile)[citation needed], making it one of the most densely populated regions in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree terrestrial ecoregions cover the delta. The Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests ecoregion covers most of the delta region, although the forests have mostly been cleared for agriculture and only small enclaves remain. Thick stands of tall grass, known as canebrakes, grow in wetter areas. The Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests ecoregion lies closer to the Bay of Bengal; this ecoregion is flooded with slightly brackish water during the dry season, and fresh water during the monsoon season. These forests, too, have been almost completely converted to intensive agriculture, with only 130 square kilometres (50?sq?mi) of the ecoregion's 14,600 square kilometres (5,600?sq?mi) protected. Where the delta meets the Bay of Bengal, Sundarbans mangroves form the world's largest mangrove ecoregion, covering an area of 20,400 square kilometres (7,900?sq?mi) in a chain of 54 islands. They derive their name from the predominant mangrove species, Heritiera fomes, which are known locally as sundri or sundari.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals in the delta include the Indian python (Python molurus), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) and crocodiles, which live in the Sundarbans. Approximately 1,020 endangered Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) are believed to inhabit the Sundarbans.\\r\\nThe GangesÿBrahmaputra basin has tropical deciduous forests that yield valuable timber: sal, teak, and peepal trees are found in these areas. The delta region has mangrove trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is estimated that 30,000 chital (Axis axis) are in the Sundarbans part of the delta. Birds found in the delta include kingfishers, eagles, woodpeckers, the shalik (Acridotheres tristis), the swamp francolin (Francolinus gularis), and the doel (Copsychus saularis). Two species of dolphin can be found in the delta: the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) and the Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica). The Irrawaddy dolphin is an oceanic dolphin which enters the delta from the Bay of Bengal. The Ganges river dolphin is a true river dolphin, but is extremely rare and considered endangered.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrees found in the delta include sundari, garjan (Rhizophora spp.), bamboo, mangrove palm (Nypa fruticans), and mangrove date palm (Phoenix paludosa). Many endangered species live here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ganges Delta lies at the junction of three tectonic plates: the Indian Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the Burma Plate.[4] The edge of the Eocene paleoshelf runs approximately from Kolkata to the edge of the Shillong Plateau. The edge of the paleoshelf marks the transition from the thick continental crust in the northwest to the thin continental or oceanic crust in the southeast. The enormous sediment supply from the Himalayan collision has extended the delta about 400 kilometres (250?mi) seaward since the Eocene. The sediment thickness southeast of the edge of the paleoshelf beneath the Ganges Delta can exceed 16?km (10 miles).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately two-thirds of the Bangladesh people work in agriculture, and grow crops on the fertile floodplains of the delta. The major crops that are grown in the Ganges Delta are jute, tea, and rice.[3] Fishing is also an important activity in the delta region, with fish being a major source of food for many of the people in the area.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, scientists have been helping the poor people of the delta to improve fish farming methods. By turning unused ponds into viable fish farms, and improving methods of raising fish in existing ponds, many people can now earn a living raising and selling fish. Using new systems, fish production in existing ponds has increased 800%.[7] Shrimp are farmed in containers or cages that are submerged in open water. Most are exported.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs there is a maze of many river branches, the area is difficult to pass. Most islands are only connected with the mainland by simple wooden ferryboats. Bridges are rare. Some islands are not yet connected to the electric grid, so island residents tend to use solar cells for a bit of electric supply.\\r\\n\\r\\nArsenic is a naturally occurring substance in the Ganga Delta that has detrimental affects on health, and may enter the food chain, especially in key crops such as rice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ganges Delta lies mostly in the tropical wet climate zone, and receives between 1,500 to 2,000?mm (59 to 79?in) of rainfall each year in the western part, and 2,000 to 3,000?mm (79 to 118?in) in the eastern part.[citation needed]. Hot, dry summers and cool, dry winters make the climate suitable for agriculture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1970, the deadliest tropical cyclone of the twentieth century hit the Ganges Delta region. The 1970 Bhola cyclone killed 500,000 people (official death toll), with another 100,000 missing. The Guinness Book of World Records estimated the total loss of human life from the Bhola cyclone at 1,000,000.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother cyclone hit the delta in 1991, killing about 139,000 people.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople have to be careful on the river delta as severe flooding also occurs. In 1998, the Ganges flooded the delta, killing about 1,000 people and leaving more than 30 million people homeless. The Bangladesh government asked for $900?million to help feed the people of the region, as the entire rice crop was lost.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the greatest challenges people living on the Ganges Delta may face in coming years is the threat of rising sea levels caused by climate change. An increase in sea level of 0.5 metres (1?ft 8?in) could result in six million people losing their homes in Bangladesh.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nImportant gas reserves have been discovered in the delta, such as in the Titas and Bakhrabad gas fields. Several major oil companies have invested in exploration of the Ganges Delta region.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 2242N 8940E? / ?22.700N 89.667E? / 22.700; 89.667","input":"Which delta is the largest delta in the world?"},{"output":"Bridget Driscoll","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe death of Bridget Driscoll (c.?1851?ÿ 17?August 1896) was the first recorded case of a pedestrian killed in a collision with a motor car in the United Kingdom.[1][2] As 44-year-old Driscoll, with her teenage daughter May and her friend Elizabeth Murphy, crossed Dolphin Terrace in the grounds of the Crystal Palace in London, Driscoll was struck by a car belonging to the Anglo-French Motor Carriage Company that was being used to give demonstration rides.[2] One witness described the car as travelling at \\"a reckless pace, in fact, like a fire engine\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the car's maximum speed was 8 miles per hour (13?km/h) it had been limited deliberately to 4 miles per hour (6.4?km/h), the speed at which the driver, Arthur James Edsall of Upper Norwood, claimed to have been travelling. His passenger, Alice Standing of Forest Hill, alleged he modified the engine to allow the car to go faster, but another taxicab driver examined the car and said it was incapable of exceeding 4.5 miles per hour (7.2?km/h) because of a low-speed engine belt. The accident happened just a few weeks after a new Act of Parliament had increased the speed limit for cars to 14 miles per hour (23?km/h), from 2 miles per hour in towns and 4 miles per hour in the countryside.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jury returned a verdict of \\"accidental death\\" after an inquest lasting some six hours.

The exact purpose of the Paleolithic cave paintings is not known. Evidence suggests that they were not merely decorations of living areas since the caves in which they have been found do not have signs of ongoing habitation. They are also often located in areas of caves that are not easily accessible. Some theories hold that cave paintings may have been a way of communicating with others, while other theories ascribe a religious or ceremonial purpose to them. The paintings are remarkably similar around the world, with animals being common subjects that give the most impressive images. Humans mainly appear as images of hands, mostly hand stencils made by blowing pigment on a hand held to the wall.\\r\\nThe earliest known cave paintings/drawings of animals are at least 35,000 years old and were found in caves in the district of Maros, located in Bantimurung district, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, according to datings announced in 2014. Previously it was believed that the earliest paintings were in Europe.[1] The earliest figurative paintings in Europe date back to the Aurignacian period, approximately 30,000 to 32,000 years ago, and are found in the Chauvet Cave in France, and in the Coliboaia Cave in Romania.[2] The earliest non-figurative rock art dates back to approximately 40,000 years ago, the date given both to a disk in the El Castillo cave and a hand stencil in Timpuseng cave Sulawesi, Indonesia. There are similar later paintings in Africa, Australia and South America, continuing until recent times in some places, though there is a worldwide tendency for open air rock art to succeed paintings deep in caves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly 340 caves have now been discovered in France and Spain that contain art from prehistoric times. Initially, the age of the paintings had been a contentious issue, since methods like radiocarbon dating can produce misleading results if contaminated by samples of older or newer material,[3] and caves and rocky overhangs (where parietal art is found) are typically littered with debris from many time periods. But subsequent technology has made it possible to date the paintings by sampling the pigment itself and the torch marks on the walls.[4] The choice of subject matter can also indicate chronology. For instance, the reindeer depicted in the Spanish cave of Cueva de las Monedas places the drawings in the last Ice Age.\\r\\nThe oldest date given to an animal cave painting is now a pig that has a minimum age of 35,400 years old at Timpuseng cave in Sulawesi, an Indonesian island. Indonesian and Australian scientists have dated other non-figurative paintings on the walls to be approximately 40,000 years old. The method they used to confirm this was dating the age of the stalactites that formed over the top of the paintings.[5][6] The art is similar in style and method to that of the Indonesian caves as there were also hand stencils and disks made by blowing paint onto the walls. Cave paintings in El Castillo cave were found to date back to at least 37,300 years old by researchers at Bristol University, making them the oldest known cave art in Europe, 5ÿ10,000 years older than previous examples from France.[7][8] This date coincides with the earliest known evidence for Homo sapiens in Europe. Because of the cave art's age, some scientists have conjectured that the paintings may have been made by Neanderthals.[9]\\r\\nThe earliest known European figurative cave paintings are those of Chauvet Cave in France. These paintings date to earlier than 30,000 BCE (Upper Paleolithic) according to radiocarbon dating.[10] Some researchers believe the drawings are too advanced for this era and question this age.[11] However, more than 80 radiocarbon dates had been obtained by 2011, with samples taken from torch marks and from the paintings themselves, as well as from animal bones and charcoal found on the cave floor. The radiocarbon dates from these samples show that there were two periods of creation in Chauvet: 35,000 years ago and 30,000 years ago. One of the surprises was that many of the paintings were modified repeatedly over thousands of years, possibly explaining the confusion about finer paintings that seemed to date earlier than cruder ones.[12] In 2009, cavers discovered drawings in Coliboaia Cave in Romania, stylistically comparable to those at Chauvet.[13] An initial dating puts the age of an image in the same range as Chauvet: about 32,000 years old.[2]\\r\\nIn Australia, cave paintings have been found on the Arnhem Land plateau showing megafauna which are thought to have been extinct for over 40,000 years, making this site another candidate for oldest known painting; however, the proposed age is dependent on the estimate of the extinction of the species seemingly depicted.[14] Another Australian site, Nawarla Gabarnmang, has charcoal drawings that have been radiocarbon-dated to 28,000 years, making it the oldest site in Australia and among the oldest in the world for which reliable date evidence has been obtained.[15]\\r\\nOther examples may date as late as the Early Bronze Age, but the well-known Magdalenian style seen at Lascaux in France (c.?15,000 BCE) and Altamira in Spain died out about 10,000?BCE, coinciding with the advent of the Neolithic period. Some caves probably continued to be painted over a period of several thousands of years.[16]\\r\\nThe next phase of surviving European prehistoric painting, the rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin, was very different, concentrating on large assemblies of smaller and much less detailed figures, with at least as many humans as animals. This was created roughly between 10,000 and 5,500 years ago, and painted in rock shelters under cliffs or shallow caves, in contrast to the recesses of deep caves used in the earlier (and much colder) period. Though individual figures are less naturalistic, they are grouped in coherent grouped compositions to a much greater degree.\\r\\nThe most common subjects in cave paintings are large wild animals, such as bison, horses, aurochs, and deer, and tracings of human hands as well as abstract patterns, called finger flutings. The species found most often were suitable for hunting by humans, but were not necessarily the actual typical prey found in associated deposits of bones; for example, the painters of Lascaux have mainly left reindeer bones, but this species does not appear at all in the cave paintings, where equine species are the most common. Drawings of humans were rare and are usually schematic as opposed to the more detailed and naturalistic images of animal subjects. One explanation for this may be that realistically painting the human form was \\"forbidden by a powerful religious taboo.\\"[17] Kieran D. O'Hara, geologist, suggests in his book Cave Art and Climate Change that climate controlled the themes depicted.[18] Pigments used include red and yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide and charcoal. Sometimes the silhouette of the animal was incised in the rock first, and in some caves all or many of the images are only engraved in this fashion, taking them somewhat out of a strict definition of \\"cave painting\\".\\r\\nSimilarly, large animals are also the most common subjects in the many small carved and engraved bone or ivory (less often stone) pieces dating from the same periods. But these include the group of Venus figurines, which have no real equivalent in cave paintings.[citation needed]\\r\\nHand stencils, made by placing a hand on the wall and blowing pigment at it (probably through a pipe of some kind), form a characteristic image of a roughly round area of solid pigment with the uncoloured shape of the hand in the centre, which may then be decorated with lines or dashes. These are often found in the same caves as other paintings, or may be the only form of painting in a location. Some walls contain many hand stencils. Similar hands are also painted in the usual fashion. A number of hands show a finger wholly or partly missing, for which a number of explanations have been given. Hand images are found in similar forms in Europe, Eastern Asia and South America.[19]\\r\\nHenri Breuil interpreted the paintings as being hunting magic, meant to increase the number of animals.\\r\\nAnother theory, developed by David Lewis-Williams and broadly based on ethnographic studies of contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, is that the paintings were made by paleolithic shamans.[20] The shaman would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a trance state, and then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing power out of the cave walls themselves.\\r\\nR. Dale Guthrie, who has studied both highly artistic and publicized paintings and a variety of lower quality art and figurines, identifies a wide range of skill and ages among the artists. He hypothesizes that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts (powerful beasts, risky hunting scenes and the representation of women in the Venus figurines) are the work of adolescent males, who constituted a large part of the human population at the time.[21][verification needed] However, in analyzing hand prints and stencils in French and Spanish caves, Dean Snow of Pennsylvania State University has proposed that a proportion of them, including those around the spotted horses in Pech Merle, were of female hands.[22]\\r\\nAt uKhahlamba / Drakensberg Park, South Africa, now thought to be some 3,000 years old, the paintings by the San people who settled in the area some 8,000 years ago depict animals and humans, and are thought to represent religious beliefs. Human figures are much more common in the rock art of Africa than in Europe.[23]\\r\\nCave paintings found at the Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia are estimated to date from approximately 23,000ÿ25,000 BCE.[24]\\r\\nIn 2002, a French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel cave paintings on the outskirts of Hargeisa in the northwestern region of Somaliland. Dating back around 5,000 years, the paintings depict both wild animals and decorated cows. They also feature herders, who are believed to be the creators of the rock art.[25] In 2008, Somali archaeologists announced the discovery of other cave paintings in Dhambalin region, which the researchers suggest includes one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is in the Ethiopian-Arabian style, dated to 1000 to 3000 BCE.[26][27]\\r\\nAdditionally, between the towns of Las Khorey and El Ayo in Karinhegane, the site of numerous cave paintings of real and mythical animals. Each painting has an inscription below it, which collectively have been estimated to be around 2,500 years old.[28][29] Karihegane's rock art is in the same distinctive Ethiopian-Arabian style as the Laas Geel and Dhambalin cave paintings.[30][31] Around 25 miles from Las Khorey is found Gelweita, another key rock art site.[29]\\r\\nIn Djibouti, rock art of what appear to be antelopes and a giraffe are also found at Dorra and Balho.[32]\\r\\nMany cave paintings are found in the Tassili n'Ajjer mountains in southeast Algeria. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the rock art was first discovered in 1933 and has since yielded 15,000 engravings and drawings that keep a record of the various animal migrations, climatic shifts, and change in human inhabitation patterns in this part of the Sahara from 6000 BCE to the late classical period.[33] Other cave paintings are also found at the Akakus, Mesak Settafet and Tadrart in Libya and other Sahara regions including: Ayr mountains, Niger and Tibesti, Chad.\\r\\nThe Cave of Swimmers and the Cave of Beasts in southwest Egypt, near the border with Libya, in the mountainous Gilf Kebir region of the Sahara Desert. The Cave of Swimmers was discovered in October 1933 by the Hungarian explorer Lszl܇ Almsy. The site contains rock painting images of people swimming, which are estimated to have been created 10,000 years ago during the time of the most recent Ice Age.\\r\\nSignificant early cave paintings, executed in ochre, have been found in Kakadu, Australia. Ochre is not an organic material, so carbon dating of these pictures is often impossible. Sometimes the approximate date, or at least, an epoch, can be surmised from the painting content, contextual artifacts, or organic material intentionally or inadvertently mixed with the inorganic ochre paint, including torch soot.[4]\\r\\nA red ochre painting, discovered at the centre of the Arnhem Land Plateau, depicts two emu-like birds with their necks outstretched. They have been identified by a palaeontologist as depicting the megafauna species Genyornis, giant birds thought to have become extinct more than 40,000 years ago; however, this evidence is inconclusive for dating. It may merely suggest that Genyornis became extinct at a later date than previously determined.[14]\\r\\nHook Island in the Whitsunday Islands is also home to a number of cave paintings created by the seafaring Ngaro people.[34]\\r\\nWell-known cave paintings include those of:\\r\\nOther sites include Creswell Crags, Nottinghamshire, England, (cave etchings and bas-reliefs discovered in 2003), Pe?tera Coliboaia in Romania,[35] Magura Cave in Bulgaria, and Kapova Cave in Russia.\\r\\nRock painting was also performed on cliff faces, but fewer of those have survived because of erosion. One example is the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi in the Saimaa area of Finland.\\r\\nWhen Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola first encountered the Magdalenian paintings of the Altamira cave, Cantabria, Spain in 1879, the academics of the time considered them hoaxes. Recent reappraisals and numerous additional discoveries have since demonstrated their authenticity, while at the same time stimulating interest in the artistry of Upper Palaeolithic peoples.\\r\\nThe Bhimbetka rock shelters exhibit the earliest traces of human life in India; a number of analyses suggest that some of these shelters were inhabited by humans for more than 100,000 years. The earliest paintings on the cave walls are believed to be of the Mesolithic period, dating to 30,000 years ago. The most recent painting, consisting of geometric figures, date to the medieval period. Executed mainly in red and white with the occasional use of green and yellow, the paintings depict the lives and times of the people who lived in the caves, including scenes of childbirth, communal dancing and drinking, religious rites and burials, as well as indigenous animals.[36]\\r\\nDistinctive monochrome and polychrome cave paintings and murals exist in the mid-peninsula regions of southern Baja California and northern Baja California Sur, consisting of Pre-Columbian paintings of humans, land animals, sea creatures, and abstract designs. These paintings are mostly confined to the sierras of this region, but can also be found in outlying mesas and rock shelters. According to recent radiocarbon studies of the area, of materials recovered from archaeological deposits in the rock shelters and on materials in the paintings themselves, suggest that the Great Murals may have a time range extending as far back as 7,500 years ago.[37]\\r\\nNative artists in the Chumash tribes created cave paintings that are located in present-day Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo Counties in Southern California. They include well executed examples at Burro Flats Painted Cave and Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park.\\r\\nThere are also Native American pictogram examples in caves of the Southwestern United States. Cave art that is 6,000 years old was found in the Cumberland Plateau region of Tennessee.[38]\\r\\nSerra da Capivara National Park is a national park in the north east of Brazil with many prehistoric paintings; the park was created to protect the prehistoric artifacts and paintings found there. It became a World Heritage Site in 1991. Its best known archaeological site is Pedra Furada.\\r\\nIt is located in northeast state of Piau, between latitudes 8 26' 50\\" and 8 54' 23\\" south and longitudes 42 19' 47\\" and 42 45' 51\\" west. It falls within the municipal areas of S?o Raimundo Nonato, S?o Jo?o do Piau, Coronel Jos Dias and Canto do Buriti. It has an area of 1291.4 square kilometres (319,000 acres). The area has the largest concentration of prehistoric small farms on the American continents. Scientific studies confirm that the Capivara mountain range was densely populated in prehistoric periods.\\r\\nCueva de las Manos (Spanish for \\"Cave of the Hands\\") is a cave located in the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, 163?km (101?mi) south of the town of Perito Moreno, within the borders of the Francisco P. Moreno National Park, which includes many sites of archaeological and paleontological importance.\\r\\nThe hand images are often negative (stencilled). Besides these there are also depictions of human beings, guanacos, rheas, felines and other animals, as well as geometric shapes, zigzag patterns, representations of the sun, and hunting scenes. Similar paintings, though in smaller numbers, can be found in nearby caves. There are also red dots on the ceilings, probably made by submerging their hunting bolas in ink, and then throwing them up. The colours of the paintings vary from red (made from hematite) to white, black or yellow. The negative hand impressions date to around 550 BC, the positive impressions from 180 BC, while the hunting drawings are calculated to more than 10,000 years old.[39] Most of the hands are left hands, which suggests that painters held the spraying pipe with their right hand.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are rock paintings in caves in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Burma. In Thailand, caves and scarps along the Thai-Burmese border, in the Petchabun Range of Central Thailand, and overlooking the Mekong River in Nakorn Sawan Province, all contain galleries of rock paintings. In Malaysia the oldest paintings are at Gua Tambun in Perak, dated at 2000 years, and those in the Painted Cave at Niah Caves National Park are 1200 years old. The anthropologist Ivor Hugh Norman Evans visited Malaysia in the early 1920s and found that some of the tribes (especially Negritos) were still producing cave paintings and had added depictions of modern objects including what are believed to be cars.[40] (See prehistoric Malaysia.)\\r\\nIn Indonesia the caves at Maros in Sulawesi are famous for their hand prints. About 1500 negative handprints have also been found in 30 painted caves in the Sangkulirang area of Kalimantan; preliminary dating analysis puts their age in the range of 10,000 years old.[41][42] In October 2014 it was announced that the Maros painting had been dated as being about 40,000 years old. Dr Maxime Aubert, of Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, said that the minimum age for the outline of a hand was 39,900 years old, which made it \\"the oldest hand stencil in the world\\" and added, \\"Next to it is a pig that has a minimum age of 35,400 years old, and this is one of the oldest figurative depictions in the world, if not the oldest one.\\"[43][44]\\r\\nThe Padah-Lin Caves of Burma contain 11,000-year-old paintings and many rock tools.\\r\\nIn the Philippines at Tabon Caves the oldest artwork may be a relief of a shark above the cave entrance. It was partially disfigured by a later jar burial scene.\\r\\nOriginating in the Paleolithic period, the rock art found in Khoit Tsenkher Cave, Mongolia, includes symbols and animal forms painted from the walls up to the ceiling.[45] Stags, buffalo, oxen, ibex, lions, Argali sheep, antelopes, camels, elephants, ostriches, and other animal pictorials are present, often forming a palimpsest of overlapping images. The paintings appear brown or red in color, and are stylistically similar to other Paleolithic rock art from around the world but are unlike any other examples in Mongolia.","input":"What did cro-magnon man paint on cave walls?"},{"output":"Fenway Park","context":"The following is a list of Major League Baseball stadiums, their locations, their first year of usage and home teams.\\r\\nThe newest Major League Baseball (MLB) ballpark is SunTrust Park in Cumberland, Georgia, home of the Atlanta Braves, which opened for the 2017 season.

Advisory opinions do not have to concern particular controversies between states, though they often do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key principle is that the Court only has jurisdiction on the basis of consent. The court has no true compulsory jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is often a key question for the Court, because it is challenged by the respondent. At the Preliminary Objections phase, a respondent may challenge (i) jurisdiction and/or (ii) admissibility of the case. Article 36 outlines four bases on which the Court's jurisdiction may be founded.\\r\\nOnly states may be parties in contentious cases before the ICJ. Individuals, corporations, parts of a federal state, NGOs, UN organs and self-determination groups are excluded from direct participation in cases, although the Court may receive information from public international organisations. This does not preclude non-state interests from being the subject of proceedings if one state brings the case against another. For example, a state may, in case of \\"diplomatic protection\\", bring a case on behalf of one of its nationals or corporations.\\r\\nFirst, 36(1) provides that parties may refer cases to the Court (jurisdiction founded on \\"special agreement\\" or compromise). This method is based on explicit consent and is, perhaps, the most effective basis for the Court's jurisdiction. It is effective because the parties concerned have a desire for the Court to resolve the dispute, and are thus more likely to comply with the Court's judgment. Parties will usually define the nature of the dispute between them and the legal questions on which they wish the Court to rule.\\r\\nSecond, 36(1) also gives the Court jurisdiction over \\"matters specifically provided for ... in treaties and conventions in force\\". Many treaties will contain a compromissory clause, providing for dispute resolution by the ICJ. For instance, Article 32(2) of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances provides for mediation and other dispute-resolution options, but also states that \\"[a]ny such dispute which cannot be settled ... shall be referred, at the request of any one of the States Parties to the dispute, to the International Court of Justice for decision\\".[2] Cases founded on compromissory clauses have not been as effective as cases founded on special agreement, since a state may have no interest in having the matter examined by the Court and may refuse to comply with a judgment. Since the 1970s the use of such compromissory clauses has declined. Many modern treaties set out their own dispute-resolution regime, often based on forms of arbitration. In 1987, upon the initiative of Mikhail Gorbachev, all of the permanent members of the Security Council began negotiations for expanding the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ. The content of these negotiations is to date unknown, and no agreements were reached. See Richard B. Bilder, \\"Judicial Procedures Relating to the Use of Force,\\" ch. 28 in Lori Damrosch & David Scheffer, Law and Force in the New International Order (1991).\\r\\nThirdly, Article 36(2) allows states to make declarations accepting the Court's jurisdiction as compulsory (\\"optional clause declarations\\"). Not all countries accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, ICJ. For example, Australia accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction \\"with reservations\\" whereas Brazil has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction, directly. However, Brazil has accepted the compulsory jurisdiction by becoming a Party to the Pact of Bogota.[1]\\r\\nIt was, moreover, to a Brazilian delegate, Raul Fernandes, that the concept of the optional compulsory jurisdiction mechanism was owed. First adopted in 1922 for the Permanent Court of International Justice (the predecessor of the International Court of Justice under the League of Nations), this system was readopted in 1945 for the International Court of Justice. \\"The 'Fernandes clause' has thus had the merit, not only of having represented a historic step forward for international law, but also of constituting today, for 62 States, one of the bases of the Court's jurisdiction\\", according to its President.[2]\\r\\nFinally, 36(5) provides for jurisdiction on the basis of declarations made under the Permanent Court of International Justice's statute. Article 37 of the ICJ's statute similarly transfers jurisdiction under any compromissory clause in a treaty that gave jurisdiction to the PCIJ.\\r\\nRefer to the Corfu Case.\\r\\nAn advisory opinion is a function of the court open only to specified United Nations bodies and agencies. On receiving a request, the Court decides which States and organizations might provide useful information and gives them an opportunity to present written or oral statements. The Court's advisory opinion procedure is otherwise modelled on that for contentious cases, and the sources of applicable law are the same. In principle the Court's advisory opinions are consultative in character and as such do not generally result in judgments that aim to resolve specific controversies. Certain instruments or regulations can, however, provide in advance that the advisory opinion shall be specifically binding on particular agencies or states.\\r\\nThe advisory opinions of the court are influential and widely respected interpretations of the law, but they are not authoritative, and they are inherently non-binding under the Statute of the Court. Examples of advisory opinions can be found in the section advisory opinions in the List of International Court of Justice cases article.\\r\\nThe relationship between the ICJ and the Security Council, and the separation of their powers, was considered by the Court in 1992, in the Pan Am case. The Court had to consider an application from Libya for the order of provisional measures to protect its rights, which, it alleged, were being infringed by the threat of economic sanctions by the UK and United States. The problem was that these sanctions had been authorised by the Security Council, which resulted with a potential conflict between the Chapter VII functions of the Security Council and the judicial function of the Court. The Court decided, by eleven votes to five, that it could not order the requested provisional measures because the rights claimed by Libya, even if legitimate under the Montreal Convention, could no longer be upheld since the action was justified by the Security Council. In accordance with Article 103 of the UN Charter, obligations under the Charter took precedence over other treaty obligations.\\r\\nThere was a marked reluctance on the part of a majority of the Court to become involved in a dispute in such a way as to bring it potentially into conflict with the Council. The Court stated in the Nicaragua case (Jurisdiction) that there is no necessary inconsistency between action by the Security Council and adjudication by the ICJ. However, where there is room for conflict, the balance appears to be in favour of the Security Council.\\r\\nShould either party fail \\"to perform the obligations incumbent upon it under a judgment rendered by the Court\\", the Security Council may be called upon to \\"make recommendations or decide upon measures\\" if the security council deems such actions necessary. In practice, the Court's powers have been limited by the unwillingness of the losing party to abide by the Court's ruling, and by the Security Council's unwillingness to enforce consequences. However, in theory, \\"so far as the parties to the case are concerned, a judgment of the Court is binding, final and without appeal,\\" and \\"by signing the Charter, a State Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with any decision of the International Court of Justice in a case to which it is a party\\".\\r\\nFor example, in Nicaragua v. United States the United States of America had previously accepted the Court's compulsory jurisdiction upon its creation in 1946 but withdrew its acceptance following the Court's judgment in 1984 that called on the United States to \\"cease and to refrain\\" from the \\"unlawful use of force\\" against the government of Nicaragua. In a split decision, the majority of the Court ruled the United States was \\"in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to use force against another state\\" and ordered the US pay reparations (see note 2), although it never did.\\r\\nExamples of cases include:\\r\\nThe last example can be used as evidence of the Court's failure to take on politically controversial cases; as the Court has no means to enforce its rulings, its survival is dependent on its political legitimacy. That would be endangered if it constantly came with rulings which states have no interest of taking into consideration. This is one of the Court's major shortcomings: its rulings must be considered in a political context.","input":"What is the contentious jurisdiction of the icj?"},{"output":"Bob Dylan","context":"The Traveling Wilburys (sometimes shortened to the Wilburys) were a British-American supergroup consisting of Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty. The band recorded two albums, the first in 1988 and the second in 1990, though Orbison died before the second was recorded.\\r\\nThe project's work received much anticipation given the diverse nature of the singer-songwriters. Their debut album Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 proved an enduring critical success, in 1989 and 1990 winning accolades such as a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nÿ Tom Petty\\r\\nGeorge Harrison first mentioned the Traveling Wilburys publicly during a radio interview with Bob Coburn on the show Rockline in February 1988.[2] When asked how he planned to follow up the success of his Cloud Nine album, Harrison replied: \\"What I'd really like to do next is ... to do an album with me and some of my mates ... It's this new group I got [in mind]: it's called the Traveling Wilburys, I'd like to do an album with them and then later we can all do our own albums again.\\"[3][nb 1] According to Jeff Lynne, who co-produced Cloud Nine, Harrison introduced the idea of the two of them starting a band together around two months into the sessions for his album,[5] which began in early January 1987.[6] When discussing who the other members might be, Harrison chose Bob Dylan and Lynne opted for Roy Orbison.[5][7] The term \\"Wilbury\\" also originated during the Cloud Nine sessions. Referring to recording errors created by faulty equipment, Harrison jokingly remarked to Lynne, \\"We'll bury 'em in the mix.\\"[8] Thereafter, they used the term for any small error in performance. Harrison first suggested \\"the Trembling Wilburys\\" as the group's name; at Lynne's suggestion, they amended it to \\"Traveling Wilburys\\".[2]\\r\\nDuring his Rockline interview, Harrison voiced his support for Dylan,[9] at a time when the latter was experiencing an artistic and commercial low point in his career.[10] Harrison and Lynne became friends with Tom Petty in October 1987, when Petty and his band, the Heartbreakers, toured Europe as Dylan's backing group.[11][12] The friendship continued in Los Angeles later that year. There, Harrison struck up a musical rapport with Petty based on their shared love of 1950s rock 'n' roll,[13] and Lynne began collaborating with Petty on what became the latter's debut solo album, Full Moon Fever,[14] and writing songs with Orbison, Lynne's longtime musical hero,[15] for his comeback album, Mystery Girl.[16][17] According to Petty, Harrison's dream for the Wilburys was to handpick the participants and create \\"the perfect little band\\", but the criteria for inclusion was governed most by \\"who you could hang out with\\".[18] The five musicians also bonded over a shared appreciation of the English comedy troupe Monty Python.[19] Harrison, who had worked with the members of Monty Python on various productions by his company HandMade Films since the late 1970s, particularly appreciated Orbison's gift for impersonation and his ability to recite entire sketches by the troupe.[20][21]\\r\\nThe band came together in April 1988,[22] when Harrison was in Los Angeles to oversee the filming of his HandMade production Checking Out.[23] At that time, Warner Bros. Records asked Harrison for a new song to serve as the B-side for the European release of his third single from Cloud Nine, \\"This Is Love\\".[24] During a meal with Lynne and Orbison, Harrison asked Lynne to help him record the track and invited Orbison to attend the session,[25] which he then arranged to take place at Dylan's garage studio in Malibu[4] since no professional studios were available at such short notice.[9] Petty's involvement came about when Harrison went to retrieve his guitar from Petty's house and invited him to attend also.[26][27]\\r\\nWorking on a song that Harrison had recently started writing, the ensemble completed the track, which they titled \\"Handle with Care\\" after a label on a box in Dylan's garage.[4] When Harrison presented the recording to Warner Bros., the executives insisted that the song was too good to be used as \\"filler\\" on a European single. In Petty's recollection, Harrison and Lynne then decided to realise their idea of forming a Wilburys band, and first invited him to join before phoning Dylan, who also agreed to join.[28] That night, Harrison, Lynne and Petty drove to Anaheim to see Orbison perform at the Celebrity Theatre and recruited him for the group shortly before he went on stage. In Petty's description, Orbison performed an \\"unbelievable show\\", during which \\"we'd punch each other and go, 'He's in our band, too.' ... We were all so excited.\\"[28]\\r\\nÿ George Harrison\\r\\nThe band members decided to create a full album together, Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. Video footage of the creative process was partly shot by British photographer NJ Latham and later edited by Harrison. The album was recorded primarily over a ten-day period in May 1988[30] to allow for Dylan's limited availability as he prepared for his upcoming US tour.[31][32] These sessions were held in the house of Eurythmics member Dave Stewart, in Los Angeles.[33] The five band members sat in a circle playing acoustic guitars in Stewart's kitchen;[34] once each song's basic track had been written and recorded there (with accompaniment from a drum machine), the group recorded their vocals in another room, usually after dinner each night.[35][36] Petty recalled that, as a friend but also an avowed fan of Dylan's, Harrison felt the need to clear the air on the first day by saying to him: \\"We know that you're Bob Dylan and everything, but we're going to just treat you and talk to you like we would anybody else.\\" Dylan replied: \\"Well, great. Believe it or not, I'm in awe of you guys, and it's the same for me.\\"[37] While most of the songs had a primary composer,[38] all of the band members were creative equals.[31] Petty later described Harrison as the Wilburys' \\"leader and manager\\",[39] and credited him with being a bandleader and producer that had a natural instinct for bringing out the best in people and keeping a recording session productive.[40][nb 2] As the group's producers, Harrison and Lynne directed the sessions, with Harrison often auditioning each member to decide who should sing a particular lead vocal part.[43][44] The two producers then flew back to England; Lynne recalls that, throughout the flight, he and Harrison enthused about how to turn the sparse, acoustic-based tracks into completed recordings.[45] Overdubs and further recording took place at Harrison's studio, FPSHOT,[28] with \\"Sideburys\\" Jim Keltner (drums), Jim Horn (saxophones) and Ray Cooper (percussion).[22] Harrison described the band's sound as \\"skiffle for the 1990s\\".[46]\\r\\nThe album was released on 18 October 1988.[47] Distributed by Warner Bros., it appeared on the new Wilbury record label rather than on Harrison's Dark Horse label, in the interests of maintaining the group identity.[42] Over the months following the end of recording in the summer, contractual issues had been successfully negotiated between Warner's and the record companies representing Dylan, Petty, Lynne and Orbison. As was the case in 1971 when EMI prepared Harrison's multi-artist live album from the Concert for Bangladesh for release, Columbia, Dylan's label, presented the main stumbling block.[22][nb 3] In the album credits, the \\"Wilburys\\" joke was extended further, with the band members listed under various pseudonyms and pretending to be half-brothers ÿ sons of a fictional Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr.[48][49] During promotion for the album, Orbison played along with the mock history, saying: \\"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder, but I remember him as a Baptist minister.\\"[50][30]\\r\\nVol. 1 was a critical and commercial success, and revitalised the careers of Dylan, Orbison and Petty.[51] As Harrison had intended, the album defied contemporary musical trends such as hip hop, acid house and synthesised pop; author Alan Clayson likens its release to \\"a Viking longship docking in a hovercraft terminal\\".[52][nb 4] The album produced two successful singles and went on to achieve triple-platinum certification for sales in the United States. It was nominated for several awards and won the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. Liner notes on the album cover were written by Monty Python's Michael Palin under a pseudonym.[30] Palin's essay was based on an idea by Derek Taylor,[49] who wrote an extensive fictional history of the Wilburys family that otherwise went unused.[39] Harrison planned a feature film about the band, to be produced by HandMade and directed by David Leland, but contractual problems ended the project.[54]\\r\\nRoy Orbison died of a heart attack on 6 December 1988.[55] In tribute to him, the music video for the band's second single, \\"End of the Line\\", shows Orbison's guitar rocking in a chair as the rest of the group play, along with a photo of him in the background.[56] Although there was speculation in the press that Del Shannon or Roger McGuinn might join the Wilburys, the remaining members never considered replacing Orbison.[39][57][nb 5] Lynne later said: \\"We'd become this unit, we were all good pals  We always knew we were going to do another one, and now it's just the four of us.\\"[57]\\r\\nIn March 1990, Harrison, Lynne, Petty and Dylan reunited to work on a second Wilburys album, which they intentionally misnumbered Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.[58] It was preceded by a non-album single, a cover of \\"Nobody's Child\\",[49] which the band recorded for Olivia Harrison's Romanian Angel Appeal charity project.[58][59] The duration of the main album sessions was again dictated by Dylan's touring schedule and limited availability. Having asked Dylan to record a lead vocal for all the songs before his departure, Harrison was then loath to replace many of the parts, resulting in a greater prominence for Dylan as a lead singer.[58] Although he ceded his own role as a lead vocalist to Dylan and to Petty,[60] Harrison took over more of the production and contributed more prominently as a lead guitarist than before.[61] Petty described the album as \\"a little more rough and ready, a bit more raucous\\" than Vol. 1,[62] while Dylan said the new songs were more developed as compositions relative to the \\"scraped up from jam tapes\\" approach to the band's debut.[58]\\r\\nVol. 3 was released on 29 October 1990.[63] It was dedicated to Orbison, as \\"Lefty Wilbury\\", the pseudonym that Orbison had used in 1988 in honour of his hero Lefty Frizzell.[64] The album met with less success than the previous one. According to Warner Bros. head Mo Ostin, the choice of album title came about through \\"George being George\\";[8] apparently Harrison was making a wry reference to the appearance of a bootleg that served as a sort of Volume 2.[65] The album's liner notes were written by Eric Idle, another Python member, who again adopted a pseudonym. For the band's final single, \\"Wilbury Twist\\", they filmed a video in which Idle, John Candy and other comedic actors attempt to master the song's eponymous dance style. The clip was filmed in Los Angeles and completed on 28 February 1991.[66][nb 6]\\r\\nAccording to Jim Keltner, the Wilburys' drummer, the decision on the group's future after Vol. 3 lay with Harrison. Keltner said that from his conversations with Lynne, Petty and Dylan, they were all keen to reunite, whereas Harrison wavered in his enthusiasm.[68] While Harrison was against the idea of touring, Petty recalled: \\"I kept getting down on my knees in front of George, saying, 'Please, it's so much money!\\"[68]\\r\\nAfter his 1991 tour of Japan ÿ his first series of concerts since 1974 ÿ Harrison spoke of a possible Traveling Wilburys tour:\\r\\nThat would be something I'd like to experience. I've always played around in my own mind what a Wilburys tour could be. Would each person do a solo set and then do Wilburys at the end, or would we all go right on from beginning to end and make everything Wilburys? It's an intriguing thought. We could have a great band up there and the four of us could play acoustic if we wanted to. We could all sing \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and Bob could sing \\"Something\\". Or we could just sing our individual songs and make them Wilbury tunes, as if we'd recorded them that way. Whatever it was, we could do it.\\r\\nThe Wilburys tour never came about. Petty said about the Wilburys touring:\\r\\nI think it would work, if we wanted to do it. I don't think we ever considered it, really. There were a lot of nights when the conversation would roll around to that. But I don't think anybody ever took it seriously. I think it would ruin it in a way. Then you're obligated to be responsible and it's not in the character of that group. It would make it very formal and that would be the wrong spirit.\\r\\nÿ Jeff Lynne\\r\\nIn the Rolling Stone Press book The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, the Traveling Wilburys are described as \\"the ultimate supergroup\\", with a line-up that represented four eras of rock music history and included \\"three indisputable gods\\" in Dylan, Harrison and Orbison. The editors also recognise the band as \\"the antithesis of a supergroup\\", however, due to the musicians' adoption of fraternal alter egos and the humour inherent in the project.[70] AllMusic managing editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine has similarly written: \\"It's impossible to picture a supergroup with a stronger pedigree than that (all that's missing is a Rolling Stone), but in another sense it's hard to call the Wilburys a true supergroup, since they arrived nearly two decades after the all-star craze of the '70s peaked, and they never had the self-important air of nearly all the other supergroups. That, of course, was the key to their charm \\"[51] Speaking to music journalist Paul Zollo in 2004, Petty agreed that humour and self-effacement had been key factors in the Wilburys' success, adding: \\"We wanted to make something good in a world that seemed to get uglier and uglier and meaner and meaner  And I'm really proud that I was part of it. Because I do think that it brought a little sunshine into the world.\\"[71]\\r\\nHarrison said the project was an opportunity to \\"put a finger up to the rules\\" by challenging the norms associated with the music industry.[19] Discussing the Wilburys in Peter Bogdanovich's 2007 documentary Runnin' Down a Dream, Petty said that one of the strengths behind the concept was that it was free of any intervention from record company, management or marketing concerns, and instead developed naturally from a spirit of co-operation and mutual admiration among five established artists.[35] Author Simon Leng recognises the venture as primarily a channel through which Harrison and Dylan could escape the restrictions of their serious media images, but also, in its guise as a \\"phantom band\\", a development by Harrison of the Rutles' satirical approach to the Beatles' legacy, in this case by \\"de-mythologizing\\" rock history.[72]\\r\\nInspired by the Traveling Wilburys' success and particularly its benefit to Petty and Orbison as artists, Warner's executive and staff producer Lenny Waronker encouraged American guitarist Ry Cooder to form the band Little Village.[73] The group, comprising Cooder, Keltner, John Hiatt and Nick Lowe, released a self-titled album in 1992.[74] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described the Notting Hillbillies' Missing ... Presumed Having a Good Time as a Traveling Wilburys-type side project for Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits.[75] Writing in New York magazine in late 1990, Elizabeth Wurtzel cited the Notting Hillbillies' album and the self-titled debut by Hindu Love Gods (a band consisting of Warren Zevon and members of R.E.M.) as examples of a trend whereby, following the Wilburys' Vol. 1, \\"more and more albums seem to be the rock-and-roll equivalents of bowling night.\\"[76]\\r\\nWriting in The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin cites the Wilburys' contemporary skiffle as evidence of Lonnie Donegan's continued influence on popular music long after the early 1960s.[77] In his book Lonnie Donegan and the Birth of British Rock & Roll, Patrick Humphries describes the Wilburys as \\"a makeshift quintet whose roots were firmly and joyously planted in low-key, low-tech skiffle music\\". He credits the band with inspiring a brief revival of Donegan's \\"DIY skiffle\\", which included Knopfler's Notting Hillbillies.[78]\\r\\nÿ Tom Petty in The True History of the Traveling Wilburys\\r\\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the two Traveling Wilburys albums had limited availability and were out of print in most areas. Harrison, as primary holder of the rights, did not reissue them before his death. In June 2007, the two albums were reissued as The Traveling Wilburys Collection, a box set including both albums on CD (with bonus tracks) and a DVD featuring a 25-minute documentary titled The True History of the Traveling Wilburys and a collection of music videos. The box set was released in three editions; the standard edition, with both CDs and DVD in a double Digipak package and a 16-page booklet; a \\"deluxe\\" boxed edition with the CDs and DVD and an extensive 40-page booklet, artist postcards, and photographs; or a \\"deluxe\\" boxed edition on vinyl. This version omits the DVD, but adds a 12-inch vinyl disc with rare versions of the songs. The release debuted at number 1 in the UK[80] and Australia,[81] and in other countries.[82] On the US Billboard 200 it reached number 9. The collection sold 500,000 copies worldwide during the first three weeks and remained in the UK top 5 for seven weeks after its release.\\r\\nIn November 2009, Genesis Publications, a company with which Harrison had been associated since the late 1970s,[83] announced the release of a limited edition fine-bound book titled The Traveling Wilburys.[84] Compiled by Olivia Harrison,[85] the book includes rare photographs, recording notes, handwritten lyrics, sketches,[19][86] and first-hand commentary on the band's history, together with a foreword by Lynne.[84] Petty, Lynne, Olivia Harrison, Barbara Orbison, Keltner and Idle were among those who attended the US launch at a Beverly Hills bookshop in March 2010.[87] In an interview to publicise the book, Lynne expressed his sadness at the deaths of Harrison and Orbison, and reflected: \\"The Wilburys was such a wonderful band, such a marvellous thing to be part of. They were the best people I could ever wish to work with. Every day was like, 'Wow!' ... it was fun from day one.\\"[85]\\r\\nJim Keltner, the session drummer and percussionist, was not listed as a Wilbury on either album. However, he is seen in all of the group's music videos, and on the DVD released in 2007, he is given the nickname \\"Buster Sidebury\\". Overdubs to the bonus tracks \\"Maxine\\" and \\"Like a Ship\\" also credited as \\"Ayrton Wilbury\\", a pseudonym for Dhani Harrison. The name Ayrton was used in honour of F1 racer Ayrton Senna.[88] Jim Horn played saxophone on both albums. The lead guitar on the Volume 3 song \\"She's My Baby\\" was played by rock guitarist Gary Moore (\\"Ken Wilbury\\").[89]\\r\\nThe Traveling Wilburys contributed the title track, \\"Nobody's Child\\", to the Romanian Angel Appeal benefit album Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal, released on 24 July 1990. Harrison appeared as Nelson Wilbury on Warner Bros. Records' 1988 holiday promo album Winter Warnerland (which also included Paul Reubens as \\"Pee Wee Wilbury\\"). In his capacity as producer, Harrison credited himself as \\"Spike and Nelson Wilbury\\" on his 1992 live album Live in Japan. The same year, the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers single \\"Christmas All Over Again\\" contained a greeting that read \\"Merry Christmas from Nelson and Pee Wee Wilbury.\\"","input":"Who are the members of the traveling wilburys band?"},{"output":"August 9, 1945","context":"","input":"When was the atomic bomb dropped on nagasaki japan?"},{"output":"23 June 1867","context":"Night on Bald Mountain (Russian: ے^  ֶ ̾ѿ, Noch na lysoy gore), also known as Night on the Bare Mountain, is a series of compositions by Modest Mussorgsky (1839ÿ1881). Inspired by Russian literary works and legend, Mussorgsky composed a \\"musical picture\\", St. John's Eve on Bald Mountain (Russian: ־־ ے^  ֶ ̾ѿ, 'Ivanova noch na lysoy gore) on the theme of a witches' sabbath occurring on St. John's Eve, which he completed on that very night, 23 June 1867. Together with Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov's Sadko (1867), it is one of the first tone poems by a Russian composer.[1]\\r\\nAlthough Mussorgsky was proud of his youthful effort, his mentor, Miliy Balakirev, refused to perform it. To salvage what he considered worthy material, Mussorgsky attempted to insert his Bald Mountain music, recast for vocal soloists, chorus, and orchestra, into two subsequent projectsthe collaborative opera-ballet Mlada (1872), and the opera The Fair at Sorochyntsi (1880). However, Night on Bald Mountain was never performed in any form during Mussorgsky's lifetime.[2]\\r\\nIn 1886, five years after Mussorgsky's death, Rimsky-Korsakov published an arrangement of the work, described as a \\"fantasy for orchestra.\\" Some musical scholars consider this version to be an original composition of Rimsky-Korsakov, albeit one based on Mussorgsky's last version of the music, for The Fair at Sorochyntsi:\\r\\nI need hardly remind the reader that the orchestral piece universally known as 'Mussorgsky's Night on the Bare Mountain' is an orchestral composition by Rimsky-Korsakov based on the later version of the Bare Mountain music which Mussorgsky prepared for Sorochintsy Fair.[3]\\r\\nIt is through Rimsky-Korsakov's version that Night on Bald Mountain achieved lasting fame. Premiering in Saint Petersburg in 1886, the work became a concert favourite. Half a century later, the work obtained perhaps its greatest exposure through the Walt Disney animated film Fantasia (1940), featuring an arrangement by Leopold Stokowski, based on Rimsky-Korsakov's version. Mussorgsky's tone poem was not published in its original form until 1968. Although still rarely performed, it has started to gain exposure and become familiar to modern audiences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Russian title of the tone poem, ־־ ے^  ֶ ̾ѿ, translates literally as Saint John's Eve on Bald Mountain, usually shortened to Night on Bald Mountain. However, due to several ambiguities, the composition is also known by a number of alternate titles in English.\\r\\nThe Russian word \\"ے^\\" (noch) is literally \\"night\\" in English, but idiomatically this would refer to the night following St. John's Day, variously observed between 21 June (the summer solstice) and 25 June. The night before St. John's Day is usually referred to as \\"St. John's Eve\\" in English; Russian does not make this distinction.\\r\\nBald Mountain is the most familiar translation of \\"ֶ ̾ѿ\\" (lysoy gore) in English, and is also the most literal. The adjective \\"bald\\" is commonly used in English place names for barren hills, mountains, and other features, and so is also idiomatic. However, because the most familiar use of \\"bald\\" describes hairlessness, this part of the title is also known as \\"Bare Mountain\\". The use of \\"bald\\" to describe barren landscapes is common in European languages. In French, the piece is known as Une nuit sur le mont Chauve (A Night on the Bald Mountain); and in Italian Una Notte sul Monte Calvo (A Night on Bald Mountain).\\r\\nSome performances of the work also insert the article \\"the\\" before \\"Bald Mountain\\" or \\"Bare Mountain\\". Articles are not used in Russian, but are often applied to nouns when translating Russian into languages that regularly use articles, such as English and French. However, because the title of the work refers to a specific place called \\"Bald Mountain\\", an article would not normally be used in English.[i]\\r\\nA sheet of paper apparently found among Mussorgsky's manuscripts contains the following statement:\\r\\nProgram of the opera St. John's Night, in three acts, after the tale by Gogol, written by P. Bobor?kin, in the presence and with the help of Modest Mussorgsky, Yevgeniy Mussorgsky, and Vasiliy. Witness to the proceedings: Miliy Balakirev.[4]\\r\\nThis curious fragment, dated 25 December 1858, has been interpreted as an indication of Mussorgsky's intent to write an opera on the subject of Gogol's short story St. John's Eve (Russian: ۿ  ־ Ť, Vecher nakanune Ivana Kupala, St. John's Eve). Gogol's tale contains the elements of witchcraft common to other stories in the Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka collection, but does not feature a witches' sabbath. No further plans for this project were mentioned.[5]\\r\\nThe theme of a witches' sabbath, the central theme in all subsequent Night on Bald Mountain projects, appears to have been derived from the nonextant play The Witch (Russian: ^, Vedma) by Baron Georgiy Mengden, a military friend of the composer. In 1860 Mussorgsky informed Balakirev that he had been commissioned to write one act of an opera on this subject:[5]\\r\\nI have also received some very interesting work which must be prepared for the coming summer. This work is: a whole act on The Bald Mountain (from Mengden's drama The Witch), a witches' sabbath, separate episodes of sorcerers, a ceremonial march of all this rubbish, a finaleglory to the sabbath... The libretto is very good. There are already some materials, perhaps a very good thing will come of it.[6]\\r\\nHowever, as with the previous project, it is unknown whether any materials were written down, and, if so, whether they were transferred to subsequent projects.\\r\\nRimsky-Korsakov declares in his memoirs (Chronicle of My Musical Life) that in the early 1860s Mussorgsky, under the influence of Franz Liszt's Totentanz, had written a version of the Bald Mountain music for piano and orchestra. However, it is believed that Mussorgsky did not hear Liszt's work until 1866, by which time he was planning the orchestral tone poem St. John's Eve on Bald Mountain (see below). No trace of a work for piano and orchestra has survived outside Rimsky-Korsakov's recollections, so it is assumed that the score has been lost, or, more likely, that it never existed.\\r\\nIn 1866 Mussorgsky wrote to Balakirev expressing a desire to discuss his plans for The Witches, his informal name for his Bald Mountain music.[7] In early June 1867, he began composing the orchestral version of the piece. The score is inscribed with the following details:\\r\\nConceived in 1866. Began to write for orchestra 12 June 1867, completed work on the eve of St. John's Day, 23 June 1867, in Luga District on Minkino Farm. Modest Musorgskiy.\\r\\n?y ־ 1866 ̾.

On his arrival they, i.e. the witches, formed a circle round the throne on which he sat, in the form of a kid, and sang his praise. When Satan was worked up into a sufficient passion by the witches' praises, he gave the command for the sabbath, in which he chose for himself the witches who caught his fancy. So this is what I've done. At the head of my score I've put its content: 1. Assembly of the witches, their talk and gossip; 2. Satan's journey; 3. Obscene praises of Satan; and 4. Sabbath?... The form and character of the composition are Russian and original?... I wrote St. John's Eve quickly, straight away in full score, I wrote it in about twelve days, glory to God?... While at work on St. John's Eve I didn't sleep at night and actually finished the work on the eve of St. John's Day, it seethed within me so, and I simply didn't know what was happening within me?... I see in my wicked prank an independent Russian product, free from German profundity and routine, and, like Savishna, grown on our native fields and nurtured on Russian bread.[9]\\r\\nHe also statedincorrectly, as it turned outthat he would never re-model it: \\"with whatever shortcomings, it is born; and with them it must live if it is to live at all.\\" Having finally completed the work, Mussorgsky was crushed when his mentor Mily Balakirev was savagely critical of it. The score is peppered with comments such as \\"the devil knows what [this is]\\", \\"what rubbish\\", and \\"this might be of use\\", probably pencilled in by Balakirev.[8][10] This \\"first version\\" was put aside, and did not appear in print until 1968, in a new edition prepared by Georgiy Kirkor.\\r\\nThe original tone poem, St. John's Eve on Bald Mountain (1867), was not performed until the 20th century. Musicologist Aleksandra Orlova claims that the original manuscript of this version was discovered in the library of the Leningrad Conservatory by musicologist Georgiy Orlov in the late 1920s, that it was performed once by the Leningrad Philharmonic Society, and that Nikolay Malko brought along a copy of it when he emigrated to the West.[11] Gerald Abraham states that this version was performed by Malko on 3?February 1932, apparently in England.[3] Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi claims that Malko performed this version in several countries in 1933.[12]\\r\\nRussian legend tells of a witches' sabbath taking place on St. John's Night (23ÿ24 June) on the Lysa Hora (Bald Mountain), near Kiev.\\r\\nThe following program is taken from the score:\\r\\nThe first re-modelling of the tone poem took place in 1872, when Mussorgsky revised and recast it for vocal soloists, chorus, and orchestra as part of act 3 that he was assigned to contribute to the collaborative opera-ballet Mlada. In this new version the music was to form the basis of the Night on Mount Triglav (Russian: ے^  ̾ѿ װ̶־, Noch na gore Triglave) scene.\\r\\nMussorgsky referred to this piece under the title Glorification of Chernobog (Russian: Ѷ־^ ѷɾ, Slavlenye Chornoboga) in a list of his compositions given to Vladimir Stasov.[14] In 1930, Pavel Lamm, in his edition of Mussorgsky's complete works, referred to the piece as Worship of the Black Goat (Russian: Ѷҿ ѷ 䶶, Sluzheniye chornomy kozlu).\\r\\nMlada was a project doomed to failure, however, and this \\"second version\\" languished along with the first. The score of Glorification of Chernobog has not survived, and was never published or performed.\\r\\nThe following scenario is taken from Rimsky-Korsakov's later \\"magic opera-ballet\\" Mlada (1890), based on the same libretto by Viktor Kr?lov.\\r\\nMlada is set in the 9th or 10th century city of Retra, in the (formerly) Slavic lands between the Baltic Sea coast and the Elbe River. This would be the land of the pre-Christian Polabian Slavs, in the region corresponding to the modern German areas of Holstein, Mecklenburg, or Vorpommern.\\r\\nThe Mlada scenario is the only Bald Mountain setting that mentions a \\"Mt. Triglav\\", where the supernatural events of act 3 take place. The name Triglav (tri three + glav head) happens to be the name of an ancient three-headed Slavic deity or a trinity of deities, and is also the name of a famous peak in Slovenia, which is, however, some 750?km (470 miles) distant.\\r\\nVoyslava and her father Mstivoy, the Prince of Retra, have poisoned Mlada, the betrothed of Yaromir, Prince of Arkona. Voyslava sells her soul to Morena, an evil goddess, to obtain her aid in making Yaromir forget Mlada so she may have him to herself. In act 3, the shade (ghost) of Mlada leads Yaromir up the slopes of Mount Triglav to a pine wood in a gorge on top of the mountain. Mlada's shade joins a gathering of the spirits of the dead. She expresses in mime to Yaromir the wish to be reunited with him in the kingdom of dead souls. He is eager to join her. However, there is a rumbling sound announcing the appearance, apparently from underground, of the following fantastic characters (many of whom also appear in Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad from The Fair at Sorochyntsi, described below):\\r\\nThe evil spirits sing in a strange demonic language, in the manner of the \\"demons and the damned\\" of Hector Berlioz's La damnation de Faust. Morena calls on Chernobog to help make Yaromir forsake Mlada. Kashchey determines that Morena and Chernobog will be successful if Yaromir is seduced by another. Chernobog commands Yaromir's soul to separate from his body, and for Queen Cleopatra to appear. Instantly the scene changes to a hall in Egypt, where the shade of Cleopatra attempts to entice Yaromir's soul to her side with a seductive dance. She almost succeeds in doing so when a cock crow announcing the break of day causes the entire infernal host to vanish. Yaromir awakens and ponders the mysterious events he has witnessed.\\r\\nThe work's \\"third version\\", the Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad (Russian: Ѿ ־ҳҿ ŤѾɿ, Sonnoye videniye parobka), was composed eight years later when Mussorgsky revived and revised the second version to function as a \\"dream intermezzo\\" in his opera The Fair at Sorochyntsi (1874ÿ80), a work which was still incomplete at the time of his death in 1881. Mussorgsky's piano-vocal score is dated 10 May 1880.[8]\\r\\nMussorgsky originally chose the end of act 1 of the opera as the location for his choral intermezzo. It is now generally performed in the Shebalin version (1930) of the opera, where it is relocated to act 3, just after the peasant lad's dumka. The theme of the dumka also serves as one of the main themes of the new quiet ending.\\r\\nThe Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad was first performed as part of Vissarion Shebalin's performing edition of The Fair at Sorochyntsi, which premiered in 1931 in Leningrad at the Maly Theater, conducted by Samuil Samosud. Shebalin's orchestration was published by Muzgiz in 1934.\\r\\nThe Fair at Sorochyntsi is set in and around the Ukrainian village of Velyki Sorochyntsi, some 500 kilometers east of Kiev and the famous \\"Bald Mountain\\" (Lysa Hora), in the year 1800.\\r\\nThe peasant Solopiy Cherevik, his domineering wife Khivrya, and pretty daughter Parasya are visiting the Sorochyntsi Fair. Parasya is wooed by Gritsko Golopupenko, the \\"peasant lad\\" of the title. Gritsko desires Cherevik's consent to marry his daughter. Although Cherevik is not against the match, his wife objects because Gritsko had thrown mud in her face on the way to the fair. Gritsko strikes a bargain with a gypsy to assist him in winning Parasya. They exploit the superstitious fears of the fairgoers, who believe that the location of the fair this year is ill-chosen, it being the haunt of a devil who was thrown out of hell, took to drinking, went broke, pawned his jacket, and has returned to claim it. After various pranks and comic circumstances, Gritsko achieves his goal and all ends happily.\\r\\nAt the end of act 1, Gritsko falls asleep some distance from the fair, and, because there has been talk of devilry, has a dream of a witches' sabbath. The following remarks are taken from the score (page numbers supplied):\\r\\nAct 1, scene 2 ÿ \\"Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad\\" (Intermezzo)\\r\\n楿־ 쳭־ҿ, ־Ҿ ҷ: ?Ѿ ־ҳҿ ŤѾɿ? (Intermezzo)\\r\\nSurviving the transfer from Glorification of Chernobog are the same supernatural characters, although Morena has been replaced by Death (Russian: ѼҒ^, Smert'). Chernobog and his accomplices form a kind of Six Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The demon language the characters sing, of which Mussorgsky was contemptuous in a letter, is preserved.\\r\\nMussorgsky sent the following program to Vladimir Stasov about three months after its composition in 1880:\\r\\nThe peasant lad sleeps at the foot of a hillock at some distance from the hut where he should have been. In his sleep appear to him:\\r\\nѾɾ Ť  Ť Ť̾ѿ, 쿹, ־  ,    ŤŤҒ^.   켼 ѿͶҶ:\\r\\nAs part of The Fair at Sorochyntsi:\\r\\nConcert version:\\r\\nIn the years after Mussorgsky's death, his friends prepared his manuscripts for publication and created performing editions of his unfinished works to enable them to enter the repertoire. The majority of the editorial work was done by Rimsky-Korsakov, who in 1886 produced a redacted edition of Night on Bald Mountain from the Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad vocal score. Rimsky-Korsakov discusses his work on the piece, designated a \\"fantasy for orchestra\\", in his memoirs, Chronicle of My Musical Life (1909):\\r\\nDuring the season of 1882/83, I continued working on Khovanshchina and other compositions of Mussorgsky's. A Night on Bald Mountain was the only thing I could not find my way with. Originally composed in the sixties under the influence of Liszt's Danse Macabre for the piano with accompaniment of orchestra, this piece (then called St. John's Eve, and both severely and justly criticized by Balakirev) had long been utterly neglected by its author, gathering dust among his unfinished works. When composing Gedeonov's Mlada, Mussorgsky had made use of the material to be found in Night, and, introducing singing into it, had written the scene of Chernobog on Mount Triglav. That was the second form of the same piece in substance. Its third form had developed in his composing of Sorochints? Fair, when Mussorgsky conceived the queer and incoherent idea of making the peasant lad, without rhyme or reason, see the sabbath of devilry in a dream, which was to form a sort of stage intermezzo that did not chime at all with the rest of the scenario of Sorochintsy Fair. This time the piece ended with the ringing of the village church bell, at the sounds of which the frightened evil spirits vanished. Tranquility and dawn were built on the theme of the peasant lad himself, who had seen the fantastic dream. In working on Mussorgsky's piece, I made use of its last version for the purpose of closing the composition. Now then, the first form of the piece was for piano solo with orchestra; the second form and the third, vocal compositions and for the stage, into the bargain (unorchestrated). None of these forms was fit to be published and performed. With Mussorgsky's material as a basis, I decided to create an instrumental piece by retaining all of the author's best and coherent material, adding the fewest possible interpolations of my own. It was necessary to create a form in which Mussorgsky's ideas would mould in the best fashion. It was a difficult task, of which the satisfactory solution baffled me for two years, though in the other works of Mussorgsky I had got on with comparative ease. I had been unable to get at either form, modulation, or orchestration, and the piece lay inert until the following year.[18]\\r\\n?  1882/83 ̾  ŤѾ ɾ  ?ھ־Ͷҷ?  Ҽ ҷ ̶󿹾̾.  ־^  Ҿ񶶒^ ?ے^  ֶ ̾ѿ?.

Bessel and Co.. It received its premiere on 15 October 1886 in St. Petersburg's Kononov Hall, performed by the orchestra of the Russian Symphony Concerts. Rimsky-Korsakov conducted the performance himself, and gives the following account of it in his memoirs, Chronicle of My Musical Life (1909):\\r\\nThe orchestration of A Night on Bald Mountain, which had baffled me so long, was finished for the concerts of [the 1886/87] season, and the piece, given by me at the first concert in a manner that could not be improved upon, was demanded again and again with unanimity. Only a tam-tam had to be substituted for the bell; the one I selected at the bell-store proved to be off pitch in the hall, owing to a change in temperature.[19]\\r\\nThe Western European premiere performance of his edition was likely the one described further on:\\r\\nIn the summer of 1889, the Paris Universal Exposition took place. Belyayev decided to give there two symphonic concerts of Russian music at the Trocadro, under my direction... The concerts were set for Saturdays 22 and 29 June, new style. Upon our arrival in Paris, rehearsals commenced. The orchestra, which proved to be excellent, the men being amiable and painstaking, had been borrowed from Colonne. Their playing in the concerts was fine... The success was considerable, with plenty of applause, but the attendance was not large.[20]\\r\\nNight on Bald Mountain was performed at the second concert, on 29 June 1889, where it followed Borodin's 'Polovtsian Dances' and 'Polovtsian March' from Prince Igor in the second half of the program.[21] Rimsky-Korsakov later mentions another performance of the piece, taking place on 25 April 1890, at the Thatre de la Monnaie in Brussels.[22]\\r\\nThe following program is printed in Rimsky-Korsakov's edition of Night on Bald Mountain, published in 1886 by V. Bessel and Co.:\\r\\nSubterranean sounds of non-human voices. Appearance of the spirits of darkness, followed by that of Chernobog. Glorification of Chernobog and Black Service. Sabbath. At the height of the sabbath, the distant ringing of a village church bell is heard; it disperses the spirits of darkness. Morning.[23]\\r\\nRecordings of Rimsky-Korsakov's revision are too numerous to catalog in this article.\\r\\nMillions of 20th-century listeners owe their initial acquaintance with Mussorgsky's tone-poem to Leopold Stokowski's version, specially produced for Walt Disney's 1940 film Fantasia. Stokowski stated that he based it on the Rimsky-Korsakov arrangement in form and content (though notably without the \\"fanfare\\" that marks the entrance of Chernobog), but on Mussorgsky's original in orchestration. However, like Rimsky-Korsakov himself, Stokowski had no copy of the original tone poem from 1867, so he did what he felt Mussorgsky would have done, being somewhat familiar with Mussorgsky's style. Stokowski had conducted the U.S. premiere of the original version of Boris Godunov in 1929, and subsequently produced a symphonic synthesis of Boris for concert purposes.[24] Despite the success of Fantasia, Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestration remains the concert favorite, and the one most often programmed.\\r\\nOther arrangements of this work have been made by Ren Leibowitz, Gottfried von Einem, Charles Gerhardt and Henry Sopkin.\\r\\nPeter Richard Conte transcribed the work for the Wanamaker Organ.[25]\\r\\nRen Leibowitz recorded his own arrangement with the Royal Philharmonic for Reader's Digest. Sir Adrian Boult conducted Charles Gerhardt's version with the New Symphony Orchestra of London, also for Reader's Digest. Alfred Walter recorded Gottfried von Einem's version with the NDR Symphony Orchestra.[citation needed]\\r\\nDavid Shire arranged an orchestral disco adaptation for the 1977 motion picture Saturday Night Fever. The arrangement, titled \\"Night on Disco Mountain\\" appears on track 10 of the soundtrack album. Except for changes in phrasing and rhythm plus the addition of a disco drumbeat and \\"scratch\\" guitar, it is fairly true to Mussorgsky's original symphonic arrangement.[26]\\r\\nPart of the orchestral version arranged by Rimsky-Korsakov is heard during the chase scenes at the Wicked Witch of the West's castle in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. This version was arranged specifically by Herbert Stothart, who provided most of the underscoring for the film.[citation needed]\\r\\nA humorous adaptation of \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" for brass band and kazoo was recorded by the Roto Rooter Good Time Christmas Band, and appears on the album Retro Rooter.[27]","input":"When was night on bald mountain first performed?"},{"output":"Upper Palaeolithic","context":"In the history of art, prehistoric art is all art produced in preliterate, prehistorical cultures beginning somewhere in very late geological history, and generally continuing until that culture either develops writing or other methods of record-keeping, or makes significant contact with another culture that has, and that makes some record of major historical events. At this point ancient art begins, for the older literate cultures. The end-date for what is covered by the term thus varies greatly between different parts of the world.[1]\\r\\nThe earliest human artifacts showing evidence of workmanship with an artistic purpose are the subject of some debate. It is clear that such workmanship existed by 40,000 years ago in the Upper Paleolithic era, but there is evidence of artistic activity dating as far back as 500,000 years ago performed by Homo erectus.[2] From the Upper Palaeolithic through the to the Mesolithic, cave paintings and portable art such as figurines and beads predominated, with decorative figured workings also seen on some utilitarian objects. In the Neolithic evidence of early pottery appeared, as did sculpture and the construction of megaliths. Early rock art also first appeared during this period. The advent of metalworking in the Bronze Age brought additional media available for use in making art, an increase in stylistic diversity, and the creation of objects that did not have any obvious function other than art. It also saw the development in some areas of artisans, a class of people specializing in the production of art, as well as early writing systems. By the Iron Age, civilizations with writing had arisen from Ancient Egypt to Ancient China.\\r\\nMany indigenous peoples from around the world continued to produce artistic works distinctive to their geographic area and culture, until exploration and commerce brought record-keeping methods to them. Some cultures, notably the Maya civilization, independently developed writing during the time they flourished, which was then later lost. These cultures may be classified as prehistoric, especially if their writing systems have not been deciphered.\\r\\nThe earliest undisputed art originated with the Aurignacian archaeological culture in the Upper Paleolithic. However, there is some evidence that the preference for the aesthetic emerged in the Middle Paleolithic, from 100,000 to 50,000 years ago. Some archaeologists have interpreted certain Middle Paleolithic artifacts as early examples of artistic expression.[3][4] The symmetry of artifacts, evidence of attention to the detail of tool shape, has led some investigators to conceive of Acheulean hand axes and especially laurel points as having been produced with a degree of artistic expression.\\r\\nSimilarly, a zig-zag etching made with a shark tooth on a freshwater clam-shell around 500,000 years ago (i.e. well into the Lower Paleolithic), associated with Homo erectus, was proposed as the earliest evidence of artistic activity in 2014.[5]\\r\\nThere are other claims of Middle Paleolithic sculpture, dubbed the \\"Venus of Tan-Tan\\" (before 300 kya)[6] and the \\"Venus of Berekhat Ram\\" (250 kya). In 2002 in Blombos cave, situated in South Africa, stones were discovered engraved with grid or cross-hatch patterns, dated to some 70,000 years ago. This suggested to some researchers that early Homo sapiens were capable of abstraction and production of abstract art or symbolic art. Several archaeologists including Richard Klein are hesitant to accept the Blombos caves as the first example of actual art.\\r\\nThe oldest undisputed works of figurative art were found in the Schw?bische Alb, Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany. The earliest of these, the Venus figurine known as the Venus of Hohle Fels and the Lion-man figurine date to some 40,000 years ago.\\r\\nFurther depictional art from the Upper Palaeolithic period (broadly 40,000 to 10,000 years ago) includes cave painting (e.g., those at Chauvet, Altamira, Pech Merle, and Lascaux) and portable art: Venus figurines like the Venus of Willendorf, as well as animal carvings like the Swimming Reindeer, Wolverine pendant of Les Eyzies, and several of the objects known as batons de commandement.\\r\\nPaintings in Pettakere cave on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi are up to 40,000 years old, a similar date to the oldest European cave art, which may suggest an older common origin for this type of art, perhaps in Africa.[7]\\r\\nMonumental open-air art in Europe from this period includes the rock-art at C?a Valley and Mazouco in Portugal, Domingo Garca and Siega Verde in Spain, and Rocher grav de Fornols?(fr) in France.\\r\\nA cave at Turobong in South Korea containing human remains has been found to contain carved deer bones and depictions of deer that may be as much as 40,000 years old.[8] Petroglyphs of deer or reindeer found at Sokchang-ri may also date to the Upper Paleolithic. Potsherds in a style reminiscent of early Japanese work have been found at Kosan-ri on Jeju island, which, due to lower sea levels at the time, would have been accessible from Japan.[9]\\r\\nThe oldest petroglyphs are dated to approximately the Mesolithic and late Upper Paleolithic boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. The earliest undisputed African rock art dates back about 10,000 years. The first naturalistic paintings of humans found in Africa date back about 8,000 years apparently originating in the Nile River valley, spread as far west as Mali about 10,000 years ago. Noted sites containing early art include Tassili n'Ajjer in southern Algeria, Tadrart Acacus in Libya (A Unesco World Heritage site), and the Tibesti Mountains in northern Chad.[10] Rock carvings at the Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa have been dated to this age.[11] Contentious dates as far back as 29,000 years have been obtained at a site in Tanzania. A site at the Apollo 11 Cave complex in Namibia has been dated to 27,000 years.\\r\\nG?bekli Tepe in Turkey has circles of massive T-shaped stone pillars dating back to the 10thÿ8th millennium BCE; the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of the pillars are decorated with abstract, enigmatic pictograms and carved animal reliefs.\\r\\nAsia was the cradle for several significant civilizations, most notably those of China and South Asia. The prehistory of eastern Asia is especially interesting, as the relatively early introduction of writing and historical record-keeping in China has a notable impact on the immediately surrounding cultures and geographic areas. Little of the very rich traditions of the art of Mesopotamia counts as prehistoric, as writing was introduced so early there, but neighbouring cultures such as Urartu, Luristan and Persia had significant and complex artistic traditions.\\r\\nThe Shigir Idol (Russian: ҰѶҳ ҳ), is the most ancient wooden sculpture in the world. It was made during the Mesolithic Era, around 7500 BC. The idol was discovered in 1894, in the peat bog of Shigir, on the eastern slope of the Middle Urals (to approximately 100?km of Yekaterinburg).[12] Western Russia participated in several phases of European prehistoric art, and southern Russia and Ukraine are key areas where nomadic Steppes art is found, for which see below.\\r\\nThe earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of prehistoric times, the petroglyphs as found in places like the Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, and some of them are older than 5500 BC. The Indus Valley civilization produced fine small cylinder seals and sculptures, and may have been literate, but after its collapse there are relatively few artistic remains until the literate period, probably as perishable materials were used.\\r\\nPrehistoric artwork such as painted pottery in Neolithic China can be traced back to the Yangshao culture and Longshan culture of the Yellow River valley. During China's Bronze Age, Chinese of the ancient Shang Dynasty and Zhou Dynasty produced multitudes of Chinese ritual bronzes, which are elaborate versions of ordinary vessels and other objects used in rituals of ancestor veneration, decorated with taotie motifs and by the late Shang Chinese bronze inscriptions. Discoveries in 1987 in Sanxingdui in central China revealed a previously unknown pre-literate Bronze Age culture whose artefacts included spectacular very large bronze figures (example left), and which appeared culturally very different from the contemporary late Shang, which has always formed part of the account of the continuous tradition of Chinese culture.\\r\\nAccording to archeological evidence, the Jmon people in ancient Japan were among the first to develop pottery, dated from the 11th millennium BCE. With growing sophistication, the Jmon created patterns by impressing the wet clay with braided or unbraided cord and sticks.\\r\\nThe earliest examples of Korean art consist of Stone Age works dating from 3000 BCE. These mainly consist of votive sculptures, although petroglyphs have also been recently rediscovered. Rock arts, elaborate stone tools, and potteries were also prevalent.\\r\\nThis early period was followed by the art styles of various Korean kingdoms and dynasties. In these periods, artists often adopted Chinese style in their artworks. However, Koreans not only adopted but also modified Chinese culture with a native preference for simple elegance, purity of nature and spontaneity. This filtering of Chinese styles later influenced Japanese artistic traditions, due to cultural and geographical circumstances.\\r\\nThe prehistory of Korean ends with the founding of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, which are documented in the Samguk Sagi, a 12th-century CE text written in Classical Chinese (the written language of the literati in traditional Korea), as beginning in the 1st century BCE; some mention of earlier history is also made in Chinese texts, like the 3rd-century CE Sanguo Zhi.\\r\\nClearer evidence of culture emerges in the late Neolithic, known in Korea as the Jeulmun pottery period, with pottery similar to that found in the adjacent regions of China, decorated with Z-shaped patterns. The earliest Neolithic sites with pottery remains, for example Osan-ri, date to 6000ÿ4500 BCE.[9] This pottery is characterized by comb patterning, with the pot frequently having a pointed base. Ornaments from this time include masks made of shell, with notable finds at Tongsam-dong, Osan-ri, and Sinam-ri. Hand-shaped clay figurines have been found at Nongpo-dong.[13]\\r\\nDuring the Mumun pottery period, roughly between 1500 BCE and 300 BCE, agriculture expanded, and evidence of larger-scale political structures became apparent, as villages grew and some burials became more elaborate. Megalithic tombs and dolmens throughout Korea date to this time. The pottery of the time is in a distinctive undecorated style. Many of these changes in style may have occurred due to immigration of new peoples from the north, although this is a subject of debate.[14] At a number of sites in southern Korea there are rock art panels that are thought to date from this period, mainly for stylistic reasons.[15]\\r\\nWhile the exact date of the introduction of bronzework into Korea is also a matter of debate, it is clear that bronze was being worked by about 700 BCE. Finds include stylistically distinctive daggers, mirrors, and belt buckles, with evidence by the 1st century BCE of a widespread, locally distinctive, bronzeworking culture.[16]\\r\\nThe time between 300 BCE and the founding and stabilization of the Three Kingdoms around 300 CE is characterized artistically and archaeologically by increasing trade with China and Japan, something that Chinese histories of the time corroborate. The expansionist Chinese invaded and established commanderies in northern Korea as early as the 1st century BCE; they were driven out by the 4th century CE.[17] The remains of some of these, especially that of Lelang, near modern Pyongyang, have yielded many artifacts in a typical Han style.[18]\\r\\nChinese histories also record the beginnings of iron works in Korea in the 1st century BCE. Stoneware and kiln-fired pottery also appears to date from this time, although there is controversy over the dates.[19] Pottery of distinctly Japanese origin is found in Korea, and metalwork of Korean origin is found in northeastern China.[20]\\r\\nSuperb samples of Steppes art - mostly golden jewellery and trappings for horse - are found over a vast expanses of land stretching from Hungary to Mongolia. Dating from the period between the 7th and 3rd centuries BCE, the objects are usually diminutive, as may be expected from nomadic people always on the move. Art of the steppes is primarily an animal art, i.e., combat scenes involving several animals (real or imaginary) or single animal figures (such as golden stags) predominate. The best known of the various peoples involved are the Scythians, at the European end of the steppe, who were especially likely to bury gold items.\\r\\nAmong the most famous finds was made in 1947, when the Soviet archaeologist Sergei Rudenko discovered a royal burial at Pazyryk, Altay Mountains, which featured - among many other important objects - the most ancient extant pile rug, probably made in Persia. Unusually for prehistoric burials, those in the northern parts of the area may preserve organic materials such as wood and textiles that normally would decay. Steppes people both gave and took influences from neighbouring cultures from Europe to China, and later Scythian pieces are heavily influenced by ancient Greek style, and probably often made by Greeks in Scythia.\\r\\nThe Art of the Upper Paleolithic includes carvings on antler and bone, especially of animals, as well as the so-called Venus figurines and cave paintings, discussed above. Despite a warmer climate, the Mesolithic period undoubtedly shows a falling-off from the heights of the preceding period. Rock art is found in Scandinavia and northern Russia, and around the Mediterranean in eastern Spain and the earliest of the Rock Drawings in Valcamonica in northern Italy, but not in between these areas.[21] Examples of portable art include painted pebbles from the Azilian culture which succeeded the Magdalenian, and patterns on utilitarian objects, like the paddles from Tybrind Vig, Denmark. The Mesolithic statues of Lepenski Vir at the Iron Gate, Serbia date to the 7th millennium BCE and represent either humans or mixtures of humans and fish. Simple pottery began to develop in various places, even in the absence of farming.\\r\\nIn Central Europe, many Neolithic cultures, like Linearbandkeramic, Lengyel and Vin?a, produced female (rarely male) and animal statues that can be called art, and elaborate pottery decoration in, for example, the ?eliesovce and painted Lengyel style.\\r\\nMegalithic (i.e., large stone) monuments are found in the Neolithic Era from Malta to Portugal, through France, and across southern England to most of Wales and Ireland. They are also found in northern Germany and Poland, as well as in Egypt in the Sahara desert (at Nabta Playa and other sites). The best preserved of all temples and the oldest free standing structures are the Megalithic Temples of Malta. They start in the 5th millennium BC, though some authors speculate on Mesolithic roots. One of the best-known prehistoric sites is Stonehenge, part of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site which contains hundreds of monuments and archaeological sites. Monuments have been found throughout most of Western and Northern Europe, notably at Carnac, France.\\r\\nThe large mound tomb at Newgrange, Ireland, dating to around 3200 BC, has its entrance marked with a massive stone carved with a complex design of spirals. The mound at nearby Knowth has large flat rocks with rock engravings on their vertical faces all around its circumference, for which various meanings have been suggested, including depictions of the local valley, and the oldest known image of the Moon. Many of these monuments were megalithic tombs, and archaeologists speculate that most have religious significance. Knowth is reputed to have approximately one third of all megalithic art in Western Europe.\\r\\nIn the central Alps, the Camunni made some 350,000 petroglyphs: see Rock Drawings in Valcamonica.\\r\\nDuring the 3rd millennium BCE,the Bronze Age began in Europe, bringing with it a new medium for art. The increased efficiency of bronze tools also meant an increase in productivity, which led to a surplus  the first step in the creation of a class of artisans. Because of the increased wealth of society, luxury goods began to be created, especially decorated weapons.\\r\\nExamples include ceremonial bronze helmets, ornamental ax-heads and swords, elaborate instruments such as lurer, and other ceremonial objects without a practical purpose, such as the oversize Oxborough Dirk. Special objects were made in gold; many more gold objects have survived from Western and Central Europe than from the Iron Age, many mysterious and strange objects ranging from lunulas, apparently an Irish speciality, the Mold Cape and Golden hats. Pottery from Central Europe can be elaborately shaped and decorated. Rock art, showing scenes from the religious rituals have been found in many areas, for example in Bohusl?n, Sweden and the Val Camonica in northern Italy.\\r\\nIn the Mediterranean, the Minoan civilization was highly developed, with palace complexes from which sections of frescos have been excavated. Contemporary Ancient Egyptian art and that of other advanced Near Eastern cultures can no longer be treated as \\"prehistoric\\".\\r\\nThe Iron Age saw the development of anthropomorphic sculptures, such as the warrior of Hirschlanden, and the statue from the Glauberg, Germany. Hallstatt artists in the early Iron Age favored geometric, abstract designs perhaps influenced by trade links with the Classical world.\\r\\nThe more elaborate and curvilinear La Tne style developed in Europe in the later Iron Age from a centre in the Rhine valley but it soon spread across the continent. The rich chieftain classes appear to have encouraged ostentation and Classical influences such as bronze drinking vessels attest to a new fashion for wine drinking. Communal eating and drinking were an important part of Celtic society and culture and much of their art was often expressed through plates, knives, cauldrons and cups. Horse tack and weaponry were also subjects deemed fit for elaboration. Mythical animals were a common motif along with religious and natural subjects and their depiction is a mix between the naturalistic and the stylized. Megalithic art was still practiced, examples include the carved limestone pillars of the sanctuary at Entremont in modern-day France. Personal adornment included torc necklaces whilst the introduction of coinage provided a further opportunity for artistic expression. The coins of this period are derivatives of Greek and Roman types, but showing the more exuberant Celtic artistic style.\\r\\nThe famous late 4th century BCE Waldalgesheim chariot burial in the Rhineland produced many fine examples of La Tne art including a bronze flagon and bronze plaques with repouss human figures. Many pieces had curvy, organic styles though to be derived from Classical tendril patterns.\\r\\nIn much of western Europe elements of this artistic style can be discerned surviving in the art and architecture of the Roman colonies. In particular in Britain and Ireland there is a tenuous continuity through the Roman period, enabling Celtic motifs to resurface with new vigour in the Christian Insular art from the 6th century onwards.\\r\\nThe sophisticated Etruscan culture developed from the 9th to 2nd centuries, with considerable influence from the Greeks, before finally being absorbed by the Romans. By the end of the period they had developed writing, but early Etruscan art can be called prehistoric.\\r\\nAncient Egypt falls outside the scope of this article; it had a close relationship with the Sudan in particular, known in this period as Nubia, where there were advanced cultures from the 4th millennium BCE, such as the \\"A-Group\\", \\"C-Group\\", and the Kingdom of Kush.\\r\\nThere is a significant body of rock painting in the region around Matobo National Park of Zimbabwe dating from as early as 6000 BCE to 500 CE.[22]\\r\\nSignificant San rock paintings exist in the Waterberg area above the Palala River and around Drakensberg in South Africa, some of which are considered to derive from the period 8000 BCE. These images are very clear and depict a variety of human and wildlife motifs, especially antelope. There appears to be a fairly continuous history of rock painting in this area; some of the art clearly dates into the 19th century. They include depictions of horses with riders, which were not introduced to the area until the 1820s.[23]\\r\\nNamibia, in addition to the Apollo 11 Cave complex, has a significant array of San rock art near Twyfelfontein. This work is several thousand years old, and appears to end with the arrival of pastoral tribes in the area.[24]\\r\\nLaas Geel is a complex of caves and rock shelters in northwestern Somalia. Famous for their rock art, the caves are located in a rural area on the outskirts of Hargeisa. They contain some of the earliest known cave paintings in the Horn of Africa, many of which depict pastoral scenes. Laas Geel's rock art is estimated to date back to somewhere between 9,000ÿ8,000 and 3,000 BCE.\\r\\nIn 2008, archaeologists also announced the discovery of cave paintings in Somalia's northern Dhambalin region, which the researchers suggest includes one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is in the Ethiopian-Arabian style, dated to 1000 to 3000 BCE.[25][26]\\r\\nOther prehistoric art in the Horn region include stone megaliths and engravings, some of which are 3,500 years old. The town of Dillo in Ethiopia has a hilltop covered with stone stelae. It is one of several such sites in southern Ethiopia dating from historic period (10th-14th centuries).[27]\\r\\nThe early art of this region has been divided into five periods:\\r\\nWorks of the Bubalus period span the Sahara, with the finest work, carvings of naturalistically depicted megafauna, concentrated in the central highlands. The Round Head Period is dominated by paintings of strangely shaped human forms, and few animals, suggesting the artists were foragers. These works are largely limited to Tassili n'Ajjer and the Tadrart Acacus. Toward the end of the period, images of domesticated animals, as well as decorative clothing and headdresses appear. Pastoral Period art was more focused on domestic scenes, including herding and dancing. The quality of artwork declined, as figures became more simplified.[28]\\r\\nThe Horse Period began in the eastern Sahara and spread west. Depictions from this period include carvings and paintings of horses, chariots, and warriors with metal weapons, although there are also frequent depictions of wildlife such as giraffes. Humans are generally depicted in a stylized way. Some of the chariot art bears resemblance to temple carvings from ancient Egypt. Occasionally, art panels are accompanied by Tifinagh script, still in use by the Berber people and the Tuareg today; however, modern Tuareg are generally unable to read these inscriptions. The final Camel period features carvings and paintings in which camels predominate, but also include humans with swords, and later, guns; the art of this time is relatively crude.[29]\\r\\nBelonging in the Lithic stage, the oldest known art in the Americas is the Vero Beach bone, possibly a mammoth bone, etched with a profile of walking mammoth that dates back to 11,000 BCE.[30] The oldest known painted object in the Americas is the Cooper Bison Skull from 10,900ÿ10,200 BCE.[31]\\r\\nThe ancient Olmec \\"Bird Vessel\\" and bowl, both ceramic and dating to circa 1000 BC as well as other ceramics were produced in kilns capable of exceeding approximately 900?C. The only other prehistoric culture known to have achieved such high temperatures is that of Ancient Egypt.[32]\\r\\nMuch Olmec art is highly stylized and uses an iconography reflective of the religious meaning of the artworks. Some Olmec art, however, is surprisingly naturalistic, displaying an accuracy of depiction of human anatomy perhaps equaled in the pre-Columbian New World only by the best Maya Classic-era art. Olmec art-forms emphasize monumental statuary and small jade carvings. A common theme is to be found in representations of a divine jaguar. Olmec figurines were also found abundantly through their period.\\r\\nLithic age art in South America includes Monte Alegre culture rock paintings created at Caverna da Pedra Pintada dating back to 9250ÿ8550 BCE.[33][34] Guitarrero Cave in Peru has the earliest known textiles in South America, dating to 8000 BCE.[35]\\r\\nPeru, including an area of the central Andes stretching from Ecuador to northern Chile, has a rich cultural history, with evidence of human habitation dating to roughly 10,000 BCE.[36] Prior to the emergence of ceramics in this region around 1850 BCE, cave paintings and beads have been found. These finds include rock paintings that controversially date as far back as 9500 BCE in the Toquepala Caves.[37] Burial sites in Peru like one at Telarmachay as old as 8600-7200 BCE contained evidence of ritual burial, with red ocher and bead necklaces.[38]\\r\\nThe earliest ceramics that appear in Peru may have been imported from the Validivia region; indigenous pottery production almost certainly arrived in the highlands around 1800 BCE at Kotosh, and on the coast at La Florida c. 1700 BCE. Older calabash gourd vessels with human faces burned into them were found at Huaca Prieta, a site dating to 2500-2000 BCE[39] Huaca Prieta also contained some early patterned and dyed textiles made from twisted plant fibers.[40]\\r\\nThe Initial Period in Central Andean cultures lasted roughly from 1800 BCE to 900 BCE. Textiles from this time found at Huaca Prieta are of astonishing complexity, including images such as crabs whose claws transform into snakes, and double-headed birds. Many of these images are similar to optical illusions, where which image dominates depends in part on which the viewer chooses to see. Other portable artwork from this time includes decorated mirrors, bone and shell jewelry, and unfired clay female effigies.[41] Public architecture, including works estimated to require the movement of more than 100,000 tons of stone, are to be found at sites like Kotosh, El Paraso, Peru, and La Galgada (archaeological site). Kotosh, a site in the Andean highlands, is especially noted as the site of the Temple of the Crossed Hands, in which there are two reliefs of crossed forearms, one pair male, one pair female.[42] Also of note is one of South America's largest ceremonial sites, Sechn Alto. This site's crowning work is a twelve-story platform, with stones incised with military themes.[43] The architecture and art of the highlands, in particular, laid down the groundwork for the rise of the Chavn culture.[44]\\r\\nThe Chavn culture dominated the central Andes during the First Horizon, beginning around 900 BCE, and is generally divided into two stages. The first, running until about 500 BCE, represented a significant cultural unification of the highland and coastal cultures of the time. Imagery in all manner of art (textiles, ceramics, jewelry, and architectural) included sometimes fantastic imagery such as jaguars, snakes, and humanÿanimal composites, much of it seemingly inspired by the jungles to the east.[45]\\r\\nThe later stage of the Chavn culture is primarily represented by a significant architectural expansion of the Chavn de Huantar site around 500 BCE, accompanied by a set of stylistic changes. This expansion included, among other changes, over forty large stone heads, whose reconstructed positions represent a transformation from human to supernatural animal visages. Much of the other art at the complex from this time contains such supernatural imagery.[46] The portable art associated with this time included sophisticated metalworking, including alloying of metals and soldering.[47] Textiles found at sites like Karwa clearly depict Chavn cultural influences,[48] and the Cupisnique style of pottery disseminated by the Chavn would set standards all across the region for later cultures.[49] (The vessel pictured at the top of this article, while from the later Moche culture, is representative of the stirrup-spouted vessels of the Chavn.)\\r\\nThe Early Intermediate Period lasted from about 200 BCE to 600 CE. Late in the First Horizon, the Chavn culture began to decline, and other cultures, predominantly in the coastal areas, began to develop. The earliest of these was the Paracas culture, centered on the Paracas Peninsula of central Peru. Active from 600 BCE to 175 BCE, their early work clearly shows Chavn influence, but a locally distinctive style and technique developed. It was characterized by technical and time-consuming detail work, visually colorful, and a profusion visual elements. Distinctive technical differences include painting on clay after firing, and embroidery on textiles.[50] One notable find is a mantle that was clearly used for training purposes; it shows obvious indications of experts doing some of the weaving, interspersed with less technically proficient trainee work.[51]\\r\\nThe Nazca culture of southern Peru, which is widely known for the enormous figures traced on the ground by the Nazca lines in southern Peru, shared some similarities with the Paracas culture, but techniques (and scale) differed. The Nazca painted their ceramics with slip, and also painted their textiles.[52] Nazca ceramics featured a wide variety of subjects, from the mundane to the fantastic, including utilitarian vessels and effigy figures. The Nazca also excelled at goldsmithing, and made pan pipes from clay in a style not unlike the pipes heard in music of the Andes today.[53]\\r\\nThe famous Nazca lines are accompanied by temple-like constructions (showing no sign of permanent habitation) and open plazas that presumably had ritual purposes related to the lines. The lines themselves are laid out on a sort of natural blackboard, where a thin layer of dark stone covers lighter stone; the lines were thus created by simply removing the top layer where desired, after using surveying techniques to lay out the design.[54]\\r\\nIn the north of Peru, the Moche culture dominated during this time. Also known as Mochica or Early Chim~, this warlike culture dominated the area until about 500 CE, apparently using conquest to gain access to critical resources along the desert coast: arable land and water. Moche art is again notably distinctive, expressive and dynamic in a way that many other Andean cultures were not. Knowledge of the period has been notably expanded by finds like the pristine royal tombs at Sipn.[55]\\r\\nThe Moche very obviously absorbed some elements of the Chavn culture, but also absorbed ideas from smaller nearby cultures that they assimilated, such as the Recuay culture and the Vic~s.[56] They made fully sculpted ceramic animal figures, worked gold, and wove textiles. The art often featured everyday images, but seemingly always with a ritual intent.[57]\\r\\nIn its later years, the Moche came under the influence of the expanding Huari empire. The Cerro Blanco site of Huaca del Sol appears to have been the Moche capital. Largely destroyed by natural events around 600 CE, it was further damaged by Spanish conquistadors searching for gold, and continues with modern looters.[58]\\r\\nThe Middle Horizon lasted from 600 CE to 1000 CE, and was dominated by two cultures: the Huari and the Tiwanaku. The Tiwanaku (also spelled Tiahuanaco) culture arose near Lake Titicaca (on the modern border between Peru and Bolivia), while the Wari culture arose in the southern highlands of Peru. Both cultures appear to have been influenced by the Pukara culture, which was active during the Early Intermediate in between the primary centers of the Wari and Tiwanaku.[59] These cultures both had wide-ranging influence, and shared some common features in their portable art, but their monumental arts were somewhat distinctive.[60]\\r\\nThe monumental art of the Tiwanaku demonstrated technical prowess in stonework, including fine detailed reliefs, and monoliths such as the Ponce monolith (photo to the left), and the Sun Gate, both in the main Tiwanaku site. The portable art featured \\"portrait vessels\\", with figured heads on ceramic vessels, as well as natural imagery like jaguars and raptors.[61] A full range of materials, from ceramics to textiles to wood, bone, and shell, were used in creative endeavours. Textiles with a weave of 300 threads per inch (80 threads per cm) have been found at Tiwanaku sites.[62]\\r\\nThe Wari dominated an area from central Peru to Ecuador, with their main center near Ayacucho, Peru. Their art is distinguished from the Tiwanaku style by the use of bolder colors and patterns.[63] Notable among Wari finds are tapestry garments, presumed to be made for priests or rulers to wear, often bearing abstract geometric designs of significant complexity, but also bearing images of animals and figures.[64] Wari ceramics, also of high technical quality, are similar in many ways to those of the preceding cultures, where local influences from fallen cultures, like the Moche, are still somewhat evident. Metalwork, while rarely found due to its desirability by looters, shows elegant simplicity and, once more, a high level of workmanship.[65]\\r\\nFollowing the decline of the Wari and Tiwanaku, the northern and central coastal areas were somewhat dominated by the Chim~ culture, which included notable subcultures like the Lambayeque (or Sicn) and Chancay cultures. To the south, coastal cultures dominated in the Ica region, and there was a significant cultural crossroads at Pachacamac, near Lima.[66] These cultures would dominate from about 1000 CE until the 1460s and 1470s, as the Inca Empire began to take shape and eventually absorbed the geographically smaller nearby cultures.\\r\\nChim~ and Sicn Cultures\\r\\nThe Chim~ culture in particular was responsible for an extremely large number of artworks. Its capital city, Chan Chan, appears to have contained building that appeared to function as museumsthey seem to have been used for displaying and preserving artwork. Much of the artwork from Chan Chan in particular has been looted, some by the Spanish after the Spanish conquest.[66] The art from this time at times displays amazing complexity, with \\"multimedia\\" works that require artists working together in a diversity of media, including materials believed to have come from as far away as Central America. Items of increasing splendor or value were produced, apparently as the society became increasing stratified.[67] At the same, the quality of some of the work declined, as demand for pieces pushed production rates up and values down.[68]\\r\\nThe Sicn culture flourished from 700 CE to about 1400 CE, although it came under political domination of the Chim~ around 1100 CE, at which time many of its artists may have moved to Chan Chan. There was significant copperworking by the Sicn, including what seems to be a sort of currency based on copper objects that look like axes.[69] Artwork includes burial masks, beakers and metal vessels that previous cultures traditionally made of clay. The metalwork of the Sicn was particularly sophisticated, with innovations including repouss and shell inlay. Sheet metal was also often used to cover other works.[70]\\r\\nProminent in Sicn iconography is the Sicn deity, which appears on all manner of work, from the portable to the monumental. Other imagery includes geometric and wave patterns, as well as scenes of fishing and shell diving.[71]\\r\\nChancay culture Chancay culture, before it was subsumed by the Chim~, did not feature notable monumental art. Ceramics and textiles were made, but the quality and skill level was uneven. Ceramics are generally black on white, and often suffer from flaws like poor firing, and drips of the slip used for color; however, fine examples exist. Textiles are overall of a higher quality, including the use of painted weaves and tapestry techniques, and were produced in large quantities.[72] The color palette of the Chancay was not overly bold: golds, browns, white, and scarlet predominate.[73]\\r\\nPachacamac Pachacamac is a temple site south of Lima, Peru that was an important pilgrimage center into Spanish colonial times. The site boasts temple constructions from several periods, culminating in Inca constructions that are still in relatively good condition. The temples were painted with murals depicting plants and animals. The main temple contained a carved wooden sculpture akin to a totem pole.[73]\\r\\nIca culture The Ica region, which had been dominated by the Nazca, was fragmented into several smaller political and culture groups. The pottery produced in this region was of the highest quality at the time, and its aesthetics would be adopted by the Inca when they conquered the area.[74]\\r\\nThis time period represents the era in which the culture of the central Andes is almost completely dominated by the Inca Empire, which began its expansion in 1438. It lasted until the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in 1533. The Inca absorbed much technical skill from the cultures they conquered, and disseminated it, along with standard shapes and patterns, throughout their area of influence, which extended from Quito, Ecuador to Santiago, Chile. Inca stonework is notably proficient; giant stones are set so tightly without mortar that a knife blade will not fit in the gap.[75] Many of the Inca's monumental structures deliberately echoed the natural environment around them; this is particularly evident in some of the structures at Machu Picchu.[76] The Inca laid the city of Cusco in the shape of a puma, with the head of the puma at Sacsayhuaman,[77] a shape that is still discernible in aerial photographs of the city today.\\r\\nThe iconography of Inca art, while clearly drawing from its many predecessors, is still recognizably Inca. Bronzework owes a clear debt to the Chim~, as do a number of cultural traditions: the finest goods were reserved to the rulers, who wore the finest textiles, and ate and drank from gold and silver vessels.[78] As a result, Inca metalwork was relatively rare, and an obvious source of plunder for the conquering Spanish.\\r\\nTextiles were widely prized within the empire, in part as they were somewhat more portable in the far-flung empire.[79]\\r\\nCeramics were made in large quantities, and, as with other media, in standardized shapes and patterns. One common shape is the urpu, a distinctive urn shape that came in a wide variety of standard capacities, much as modern storage containers do.[80] In spite of this standardization, many local areas retained some distinctive aspects of their culture in the works they produced; ceramics produced in areas under significant Chim~ control prior to the Inca rule still retain characteristics indicative of that style.[81]\\r\\nFollowing the Spanish conquest, the art of the central Andes was significantly affected by the conflict and diseases brought by the Spanish. Early colonial period art, began to show influences of both Christianity and Inca religious and artistic ideas, and eventually also began to encompass new techniques brought by the conquerors, including oil painting on canvas.[82]\\r\\nThe earliest evidence of decorated pottery in South America is to be found in two places. A variety of sites in the Santarm region of Brazil contain ceramic sherds dating to a period between 5000 and 3000 BCE.[83] Sites in Colombia, at Mons~ and San Jacinto contained pottery finds in different styles, and date as far back as 3500 BCE.[84] This is an area of active research and subject to change.[85] The ceramics were decorated with curvilinear incisions. Another ancient site at Puerto Hormiga in the Bolvar Department of Colombia dating to 3100 BCE contained pottery fragments that included figured animals in a style related to later Barrancoid cultural finds in Colombia and Venezuela.[84] Valdivia, Ecuador also has a site dated to roughly 3100 BCE containing decorated fragments, as well as figurines, many represent nude females. The Valdivian style stretched as far south as northern Peru,[86] and may, according to Lavalle, yet yield older artifacts.[83]\\r\\nBy 2000 BCE, pottery was evident in eastern Venezuela. The La Gruta style, often painted in red or white, included incised animal figures in the ceramic, as well as ceramic vessels shaped as animal effigies. The Rancho Peludo style of western Venezuela featured relatively simple textile-type decorations and incisions.[86] Finds in the central Andes dating to 1800 BCE and later appear to be derived from the Valdivian tradition of Ecuador.[87]\\r\\nRelatively little is known about the early settlement of much of South America east of the Andes. This is due to the lack of stone (generally required for leaving durable artifacts), and a jungle environment that rapidly recycles organic materials. Beyond the Andean regions, where the inhabitants were more clearly related to the early cultures of Peru, early finds are generally limited to coastal areas and those areas where there are stone outcrops. While there is evidence of human habitation in northern Brazil as early as 8000 BCE,[88] and rock art of unknown (or at best uncertain) age, ceramics appear to be the earliest artistic artifacts. The Mina civilization of Brazil (3000ÿ1600 BCE) had simple round vessels with a red wash, that were stylistic predecessors to later Bahia and Guyanan cultures.[86]\\r\\nThe southern reaches of South America show evidence of human habitation as far back as 10,000 BCE. A site at Arroio do Fosseis on the pampa in southern Brazil has shown reliable evidence to that time,[89] and the Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of the continent has been occupied since 7000 BCE.[90] Artistic finds are scarce; in some parts of Patagonia ceramics were never made, only being introduced by contact with Europeans.[91]\\r\\nFrom earliest times, the natives of Australia, often known as Aborigines, have been creating distinctive patterns of art. Much of Aboriginal art is transitory, drawn in sand or on the human body to illustrate a place, an animal totem, or a tribal story. Early surviving artworks of the Aborigines are mostly rock paintings. Many are called X-ray paintings because they show the bones and organs of the animals they depict. Some Aboriginal art seems abstract to modern viewers; Aboriginal art often employs geometrical figures and lines to represent landscape, which is often shown from a birds-eye view. For instance, in Aboriginal symbolism, a swirl stands for a watering hole.\\r\\nThe Bradshaw rock paintings are a style of rock art found in Western Australia. They are predominantly human figures drawn in fine detail with accurate anatomical proportioning. They are usually dated to be around 17,000 years old, and there have been suggestions they are as much as 70,000 years old.[92]\\r\\nThe natives of Polynesia have a distinct artistic heritage. While many of their artifacts were made with organic materials and thus lost to history, some of their most striking achievements survive in clay and stone. Among these are numerous pottery fragments from western Oceania, from the late 2nd millennium BCE. Also, the natives of Polynesia left scattered around their islands Petroglyphs, stone platforms or Marae, and sculptures of ancestor figures, the most famous of which are the Moai of Easter Island.","input":"Paleolithic art including cave art and portable art began during what period?"},{"output":"2008 season","context":"Major League Baseball (MLB) allows the use of instant replay review to allow league officials to review certain types of plays in order to determine the accuracy of the initial call of the umpires on the field. Reviews may be initiated either by a team's manager with limitations or by the umpires themselves. All instant-replay reviews are examined by an umpire at the Replay Command Center in New York City, who has the final decision as to whether to uphold or overturn the initial call.\\r\\nMLB was the last of the four major North American professional sports leagues to implement an instant replay review system. Instant replay review was first implemented during the 2008 season. Under that system, only the umpire crew chief could initiate a review, and one or more members of the umpiring crew would review the video at the stadium and render the decision to uphold or overturn the call. Only boundary home run calls could be reviewed, either if the initial call was a home run but might not have been (e.g., spectator interference or a foul ball near the foul pole) or if the initial call was not a home run but might have been (e.g., the ball hit an object such as a railing beyond the outfield wall and then bounced back onto the field).[1][2]\\r\\nThe current instant replay system was implemented in the 2014 season. Under the current system each manager is allotted one challenge per game, with additional challenges granted only if the previous one was successful. From the eighth inning on, the umpire crew chief is allowed to initiate his own replay review. The umpire crew chief is also allowed to initiate a review during any inning if the play in question is a boundary home run call.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following plays may be subjected to instant replay review:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo initiate a managers's challenge, a manager must enter the field of play and verbally tell the umpire he will use his challenge. Teams are allowed to have a replay assistant in the booth watch the replay and talk with a coach via the dugout telephone to decide if the team should challenge the call. A player or coach in the dugout will signal to the manager whether or not to use the challenge.\\r\\nWhen a play is reviewed, at least two umpires, (including the crew chief) will go to an area behind home plate where they will meet a technician. The technician hands the umpires headsets where they can communicate with the umpires at the Replay Command Center in New York City. During the review, the replay may be displayed on the stadium video screen. Once the call is determined, the field technician will leave and the crew chief will signal the final call. If a manager enters the field of play to argue a reviewed call, he will be automatically ejected from the game.[4]\\r\\nInstant replay in MLB actually had been used once before in the 1999 season during a Florida Marlins home game at Pro Player Stadium. This was the first instance in which instant replay was utilized in Major League Baseball.[5] While playing the St. Louis Cardinals, Cliff Floyd hit a ball off of the top of the left field scoreboard. Originally ruled a double, then ruled a home run, NL Umpire Frank Pulli reverted the call back to a double, after consulting a TV monitor in the Marlins dugout. The Cardinals won the game, 5-2, and the Marlins protested the use of the TV monitor. The National League Office declared the umpires erred in using instant replay, and the American League Office concurred that instant replay was not to be used in the future. However, the Marlins protest was denied on the grounds that it was a judgment call rather than a rules violation as such, and the play stood.[6] MLB did not use instant replay again for almost a decade.[7]\\r\\nAlthough not an exact \\"instant\\" replay, a controversial play in the 1969 World Series involving a J. C. Martin bunt attempt led Commissioner Bowie Kuhn to study the videotape the next day, to assure himself and to announce that a reasonable call had been made by the umpires.\\r\\nMajor League Baseball instant replay was instituted on August 28, 2008 by commissioner Bud Selig. \\"I believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis\\", Commissioner Selig said. \\"The system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game.\\"[8]\\r\\nAlthough MLB was the last of the four major United States professional sports leagues to implement an instant replay review system, replay was used 123 times between August 28, 2008 and the conclusion of the 2010 season (with 48 of those instances resulting in overturned calls).[9]\\r\\nReplay made its official, sanctioned MLB debut at Tropicana Field on September 3, 2008 after Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees hit a ball near the left-field foul pole that was initially ruled a home run by third base umpire Brian Runge. Tampa Bay Rays manager Joe Maddon and catcher Dioner Navarro argued that the ball was foul and asked for a review. After a conversation among the umpires, crew chief Charlie Reliford allowed the replay, which was sent by MLB.com logger Dominic Sims, to take place and after review, upheld the home run call.[10]\\r\\nThe first instance of an umpire's call being overturned by instant replay also occurred at Tropicana Field. On September 19, 2008, in the bottom of the 4th inning with two men on, Carlos Pe?a of the Rays hit the ball just over the fence in right field. The umpires originally ruled that there was spectator interference, but after several minutes of viewing replays, the umpires returned to the field and signaled it a home run, extending the Rays' lead to 9-0 at that point.[11]\\r\\nAside from the two aforementioned reviews at Tampa Bay, review was used five additional times during the 2008 regular season: twice at Houston, and once each at Seattle, San Francisco, and Philadelphia.\\r\\nOn March 16, 2009, during the 2009 World Baseball Classic, instant replay was requested for the first time in the tournament's history at Dolphin Stadium to give Venezuela a home run against Puerto Rico. Crew chief Ed Rapuano stated in a postgame press conference that there was never any replay, because the \\"war room\\" in New York City was unable to send him a replay of the play in question due to technical difficulties. The umpires, two from the United States and two from Japan, then worked with a translator to make a final ruling. Three of the four umpires said they believed it was a home run, and when third-base umpire Hitoshi Watarida was asked by Rapuano if he was \\"110 percent sure\\" that it was a home run, Watarida said yes. Nearly 10 minutes after first entering the dugout, the umpires returned to the field and awarded the Venezuelan team with a home run.[12]\\r\\nInstant replay instead made its WBC debut during the 2013 World Baseball Classic as umpires upheld a home run call during a Mexico vs. USA game.[13]\\r\\nOn June 19, 2009, instant replay was used twice in a game for the first time, during a Detroit Tigers vs. Milwaukee Brewers game.\\r\\nOn October 31, 2009, instant replay was used for the first time in a World Series, when in the fourth inning of Game 3 of the World Series, Alex Rodriguez hit a ball that bounced off the camera in right field. Initially called as a double, the umpires reviewed the play, and determined that had the camera not been in its location, the ball probably would have left the park, and a home run was awarded to Rodriguez, making the score 3-2.[14]\\r\\nOn June 1, 2011, Billy Butler of the Kansas City Royals hit a fly ball to left field in the bottom of the ninth inning of a scoreless game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The ball hit off the fence over the left-field wall and skipped back onto the field. It was ruled a double and Jeff Francoeur held at third. Manager Ned Yost argued that it was a home run. The umpires reviewed it and saw that the ball hit off the back part of the fence and went back onto the field (Kauffman Stadium's configuration allows for this play to be officiated as a home run). After review, the umpires accordingly ruled home run, granting the Royals a 2-0 victory. This was the second walk-off home run reviewed by instant replay in MLB history.\\r\\nOn June 29, 2011, Jorge Posada of the New York Yankees hit a fly ball to right field. The ball bounced off the wall and a fan reached over to grab it. Originally ruled a base hit, instant replay showed that the fan touched the ball as it bounced back onto the field. After the review, the umpires called it a home run.\\r\\nOn August 17, 2011, Billy Butler hit a fly ball to left field. It hit off the railing in left. Brett Gardner grabbed the ball when it came back in and threw it into the infield. The umpires called it a home run. Joe Girardi came out to argue. The umpires looked at the review. The replays showed that the ball hit off the wall in left, exited the field and returned; the call stood, giving Butler his 15th home run of the season.[15]\\r\\nOn August 18, 2011, Justin Morneau hit a deep fly ball to right field that appeared to go just to the right side of the foul pole for a foul ball. However, the umpires immediately called it a home run. For the second straight night, Joe Girardi came out to argue the call and ask for a review. The umpires reviewed and ruled that the ball did indeed go past the right side of the foul pole, thus calling it a foul ball. Twins manager Ron Gardenhire came out to argue the call and was ejected from the game by home plate umpire Brian O'Nora for arguing a decision to change a call after looking at instant replay, which pursuant to MLB rule, shall result in an automatic ejection.[16]\\r\\nOn September 4, 2011, Hunter Pence of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a fly ball to deep right field. Originally ruled a live ball, instant replay showed Marlins right fielder Bryan Petersen was interfered with by multiple fans during his opportunity to catch a ball, under Rule 2.00 INTERFERENCE (d)(1) and (2). After instant replay review, first base umpire and crew chief Joe West ruled Pence out under the provisions of spectator interference, Rule 3.16, and sent Phillies baserunner Ryan Howard back to first base. For the second time in less than a month, a manager was ejected arguing the instant replay decision: Charlie Manuel was ejected and elected to play the game under protest. On September 7, 2011, MLB VP of Baseball Operations Joe Torre denied the first ever protest associated with authorized instant replay usage.[17]\\r\\nDuring the 2011 American League Division Series, Robinson Can܇ of the New York Yankees hit a fly ball to left field. It bounced off the wall and back into play. Cano argued that the ball went over the wall. Instant replay showed that the ball bounced off the wall and narrowly missed a fan, bouncing back into play. Therefore, the call stood.\\r\\nOn May 8, 2013, Adam Rosales of the Oakland Athletics hit a game tying home run, but was initially ruled a double, as the ball hit a railing behind the wall in left field and bounced back on the field. Despite video replays clearly indicating a home run, umpire ngel Hernndez upheld the original ruling. Oakland manager Bob Melvin was ejected for arguing and the Cleveland Indians held on to win 4-3.[18]\\r\\nInstant replay was not expanded in 2012, and Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Joe Torre confirmed that instant replay would again not be expanded in time for Opening Day 2013, putting off plans for another season.[19] On August 15, 2013, Major League Baseball announced that it would expand its video review process for the 2014 season, granting managers one challenge over the first six innings of games and two from the seventh inning until the end of the game. Calls that are challenged would be reviewed by a crew in MLB headquarters in New York City, who make the final ruling.[20]\\r\\nAs part of the 2014 collective bargaining agreement between MLB's owners and players union (MLBPA), and approval by the umpires union (WUA), two additional elements were added to the replay rules. Instant replay was expanded to include fair and foul calls and balls that are caught or trapped by the player catching the ball. It also expanded interference reviews beyond the home run boundary to all walls.\\r\\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2013 World Series, MLB announced it would test expanded instant replay as proposed for 2014 for a week's slate of games in the Arizona Fall League.[21] During the second inning of the Tuesday, November 5 Solar Sox-Rafters game played at Talking Stick, first base umpire Sean Barber ruled batter CJ Cron out at first base on a close play. Manager Bill Richardson approached plate umpire Hal Gibson to challenge the play, initiating the first video review conducted by off-field umpires and relayed via headset to the plate umpire; Barber's out call was upheld after the review. In total, four plays were reviewed during the debut game, with instant replay affirming the umpire's on-field call all four times.[22]\\r\\nThe first overturned call occurred during November 6's Rafters-Scorpions game when umpires used replay to reverse an out call on a stolen base attempt. The game also featured a rare multi-replay challenge, as video review upheld two umpiring calls in one play  batter Kyle Kubitza's touch of second base as well as his slide into third base ahead of a tag.[23]\\r\\nIn total, fifteen calls were challenged with three overturned upon instant replay review, resulting in a 20% overturn rate.[24]\\r\\nTo accommodate the anticipated expansion of instant replay, MLB promoted seven minor league umpires to the full-time major league staff on January 14, 2014.[25] Two days later, on January 16, MLB officially announced the approval of expanded instant replay for use during the 2014 season, whose terms were modified after negotiations with the MLBPA and WUA.[26] According to its terms, managers will be allotted one challenge per game (two if the first challenge results in an overturned call) while the umpiring crew chief will be empowered to initiate a review in innings 7 and later. The umpires will also be allowed to review a home run call at any time. Once a call is challenged an umpire requests a video review, fellow umpires in New York's Replay Operations Center will watch video of the play in question using the \\"indisputable video evidence\\" standard when deciding whether to overturn a call. The following plays will be reviewable under the system:\\r\\nJudgment calls not specified above, including, but not limited to, pitches called ball or strike, obstruction, interference, the infield fly rule, and checked swings are not reviewable.\\r\\nOn March 31, 2014, the first instant replay challenge logged was sent by former MLB.com logger Drew \\"Cashmere\\" Schaefer with the MLB Replay Tech in NYC being Timothy Akins[27] as Chicago Cubs manager Rick Renteria challenged a potential double play in the top of fifth inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates, disputing the call on the field that pitcher Jeff Samardzija was out at first. The umpires confirmed the call on the field, and the Cubs lost the challenge. From announcement of the challenge to confirmation of the call, the process took 1 minute and 40 seconds, longer than MLB's hope for 60 to 90 seconds per review. Later that day, the first successful challenge took place when Atlanta Braves manager Fredi Gonzlez challenged the call of a Ryan Braun single. It was overturned to an out in a review that took 58 seconds, although the Braves lost the game to the Milwaukee Brewers 2-0; coincidentally, former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig was in attendance for the first successful challenge. Moments later, the aforementioned CubsÿPirates game had the second overturned call (and the first in extra innings) when Emilio Bonifacio was called safe on a pickoff attempt by Bryan Morris. Pirates manager Clint Hurdle successfully challenged the call, and was said to influence the outcome of the game, a 1-0 Pirates victory.[28] Finally, the first umpire-initiated review took place in a game between the Oakland Athletics and Cleveland Indians when umpire Mike Winters wanted to confirm that Oakland catcher John Jaso did not unnecessarily block the plate as Michael Brantley attempted to score.[29]\\r\\nAs of the 2014 All-Star Break, instant replay was generally well received by managers, players, and umpires. Managers challenged 606 calls, or an average of one every 2.35 games, of which 52% were overturned. Including situations where umpires request the Replay Operations Center to review a call, 47.7% of calls are overturned. However, MLB informally allows up to 30 seconds to have the team's video coordinator signal a call to the manager. When situations where the manager comes out on the field to await a decision from a team video coordinator are included, MLB estimates the percentage of calls overturned decreases to 21%. The average replay review takes one minute and fifty seconds, which is higher than MLB's original goal of 90 seconds per review.[30]\\r\\nOne side effect has been the addition of 12 new umpires, the most since 1999, to MLB staff, due to the need to staff the Replay Operations Center with two crews. However, statistics show that umpiring quality has remained constant despite the additions, with four out of the top seven umpires with reversals those who have umpired more than 1,600 games.[30]\\r\\nThe following changes were made in 2015:[31]","input":"When was instant replay first used in mlb?"},{"output":"in 1791","context":"Government victory\\r\\nThe Whiskey Rebellion (also known as the Whiskey Insurrection) was a tax protest in the United States beginning in 1791 during the presidency of George Washington. The so-called \\"whiskey tax\\" was the first tax imposed on a domestic product by the newly formed federal government. It became law in 1791, and was intended to generate revenue for the war debt incurred during the Revolutionary War. The tax applied to all distilled spirits, but American whiskey was by far the country's most popular distilled beverage in the 18th century, so the excise became widely known as a \\"whiskey tax\\". Farmers of the western frontier were accustomed to distilling their surplus rye, barley, wheat, corn, or fermented grain mixtures into whiskey. These farmers resisted the tax. In these regions, whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. Many of the resisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for the principles of the American Revolution, in particular against taxation without local representation, while the federal government maintained that the taxes were the legal expression of Congressional taxation powers.\\r\\nThroughout Western Pennsylvania counties, protesters used violence and intimidation to prevent federal officials from collecting the tax. Resistance came to a climax in July 1794, when a U.S. marshal arrived in western Pennsylvania to serve writs to distillers who had not paid the excise. The alarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of tax inspector General John Neville. Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to western Pennsylvania to negotiate with the rebels, while at the same time calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax. Washington himself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000 militiamen provided by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The rebels all went home before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation. About 20 men were arrested, but all were later acquitted or pardoned. Most distillers in nearby Kentucky were found to be all but impossible to taxin the next six years, over 175 distillers from Kentucky were convicted of violating the tax law.[3] Numerous examples of resistance are recorded in court documents and newspaper accounts.[4]\\r\\nThe Whiskey Rebellion demonstrated that the new national government had the will and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws, though the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect. The events contributed to the formation of political parties in the United States, a process already underway. The whiskey tax was repealed in the early 1800s during the Jefferson administration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA new U.S. federal government began operating in 1789, following the ratification of the United States Constitution. The previous central government under the Articles of Confederation had been unable to levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolution, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt.[5] Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his Report on Public Credit, he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the federal government. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.[6]\\r\\nA source of government revenue was needed to pay the respectable amount due to the previous bondholders to whom the debt was owed. By December 1790, Hamilton believed that import duties, which were the government's primary source of revenue, had been raised as high as feasible.[7] He therefore promoted passage of an excise tax on domestically produced distilled spirits. This was to be the first tax levied by the national government on a domestic product.[8] Whiskey was by far the most popular distilled beverage in late 18th-century America, so the excise became known as the \\"whiskey tax.\\" Taxes were politically unpopular, and Hamilton believed that the whiskey excise was a luxury tax and would be the least objectionable tax that the government could levy.[9] In this, he had the support of some social reformers, who hoped that a \\"sin tax\\" would raise public awareness about the harmful effects of alcohol.[10] The whiskey excise act, sometimes known as the \\"Whiskey Act\\", became law in March 1791.[11] George Washington defined the revenue districts, appointed the revenue supervisors and inspectors, and set their pay in November 1791.[12]\\r\\nThe population of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790.[13] Among the farmers in the region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners.[14] Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills.[15] Farmers living west of the Appalachian Mountains distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A whiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers.[16] Additionally, cash was always in short supply on the frontier, so whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. For poorer people who were paid in whiskey, the excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay.[17]\\r\\nSmall-scale farmers also protested that Hamilton's excise effectively gave unfair tax breaks to large distillers, most of whom were based in the east. There were two methods of paying the whiskey excise: paying a flat fee or paying by the gallon. Large distillers produced whiskey in volume and could afford the flat fee. The more efficient they became, the less tax per gallon they would pay (as low as 6?cents, according to Hamilton). Western farmers who owned small stills did not usually operate them year-round at full capacity, so they ended up paying a higher tax per gallon (9?cents), which made them less competitive.[18] The regressive nature of the tax was further compounded by an additional factor: whiskey sold for considerably less on the cash-poor Western frontier than in the wealthier and more populous East. This meant that, even if all distillers had been required to pay the same amount of tax per gallon, the small-scale frontier distillers would still have to remit a considerably larger proportion of their product's value than larger Eastern distillers. Small-scale distillers believed that Hamilton deliberately designed the tax to ruin them and promote big business, a view endorsed by some historians.[19] However, historian Thomas Slaughter argued that a \\"conspiracy of this sort is difficult to document\\".[20] Whether by design or not, large distillers recognized the advantage that the excise gave them and they supported it.[21]\\r\\nOther aspects of the excise law also caused concern. The law required all stills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant Federal, rather than local courts. The only Federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 miles away from the small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the Federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small western distillers simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore the brunt of the protester's ire. Tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who offered them office space or housing. As a result, many western counties never had a resident Federal tax official.[22]\\r\\nIn addition to the whiskey tax, westerners had a number of other grievances with the national government, chief among which was the perception that the government was not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier.[22] The Northwest Indian War was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that the government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the whiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.[23]\\r\\nMany residents of the western frontier petitioned against passage of the whiskey excise. When that failed, some western Pennsylvanians organized extralegal conventions to advocate repeal of the law.[24] Opposition to the tax was particularly prevalent in four southwestern counties: Allegheny, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland.[25] A preliminary meeting held on July 27, 1791 at Redstone Old Fort in Fayette County called for the selection of delegates to a more formal assembly, which convened in Pittsburgh in early September 1791. The Pittsburgh convention was dominated by moderates such as Hugh Henry Brackenridge, who hoped to prevent the outbreak of violence.[26] The convention sent a petition for redress of grievances to the Pennsylvania Assembly and the U.S House of Representatives, both located in Philadelphia.[27] As a result of this and other petitions, the excise law was modified in May 1792. Changes included a 1-cent reduction in the tax that was advocated by William Findley, a congressman from western Pennsylvania, but the new excise law was still unsatisfactory to many westerners.[28]\\r\\nAppeals to nonviolent resistance were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, a recently appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in Washington County.[29] A man sent by officials to serve court warrants to Johnson's attackers was whipped, tarred, and feathered.[30] Because of these and other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792.[31] The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the American Revolution. Supporters of the excise argued that there was a difference between taxation without representation in colonial America, and a tax laid by the elected representatives of the American people.[32]\\r\\nOlder accounts of the Whiskey Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to western Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to the whiskey tax in the western counties of every other state in Appalachia (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia).[33] The whiskey tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, where no one could be convinced to enforce the law or prosecute evaders.[34][35] In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General Edmund Randolph argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.[36]\\r\\nIn August 1792, a second convention was held in Pittsburgh to discuss resistance to the whiskey tax. This meeting was more radical than the first convention; moderates such as Brackenridge and Findley were not in attendance. Future Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin was one moderate who did attend, to his later regret.[37] A militant group known as the Mingo Creek Association dominated the convention and issued radical demands. As some of them had done in the American Revolution, they raised liberty poles, formed committees of correspondence, and took control of the local militia. They created an extralegal court and discouraged lawsuits for debt collection and foreclosures.[38]\\r\\nHamilton regarded the second Pittsburgh convention as a serious threat to the operation of the laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official George Clymer to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration.[39] Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned down some of the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadside and printed in many newspapers.[40]\\r\\nFederal tax inspector for western Pennsylvania General John Neville was determined to enforce the excise law.[41] He was a prominent politician and wealthy planterand also a large-scale distiller. He had initially opposed the whiskey tax, but subsequently changed his mind, a reversal that angered some western Pennsylvanians.[42] In August 1792, Neville rented a room in Pittsburgh for his tax office, but the landlord turned him out after being threatened with violence by the Mingo Creek Association.[43] From this point on, tax collectors were not the only people targeted in Pennsylvania; those who cooperated with federal tax officials also faced harassment. Anonymous notes and newspaper articles signed by \\"Tom the Tinker\\" threatened those who complied with the whiskey tax.[44] Those who failed to heed the warnings might have their barns burned or their stills destroyed.[45]\\r\\nResistance to the excise tax continued through 1793 in the frontier counties of Appalachia. Opposition remained especially strident in western Pennsylvania.[46] In June, Neville was burned in effigy by a crowd of about 100 people in Washington County.[47] On the night of November 22, 1793, men broke into the home of tax collector Benjamin Wells in Fayette County. Wells was, like Neville, one of the wealthier men in the region.[48] At gunpoint, the intruders forced him to surrender his commission.[46] President Washington offered a reward for the arrest of the assailants, to no avail.[49]\\r\\nThe resistance came to a climax in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney William Rawle issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax.[50] Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means.[51] At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials to be held in local state courts.[52] But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General William Bradford later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.[53]\\r\\nThe timing of these events later proved to be controversial. Findley was a bitter political foe of Hamilton, and he maintained in his book on the insurrection that the treasury secretary had deliberately provoked the uprising by issuing the subpoenas just before the law was made less onerous.[54] In 1963, historian Jacob Cooke, an editor of Hamilton's papers, regarded this charge as \\"preposterous\\", calling it a \\"conspiracy thesis\\" that overstated Hamilton's control of the federal government.[55] In 1986, historian Thomas Slaughter argued that the outbreak of the insurrection at this moment was due to \\"a string of ironic coincidences\\", although \\"the question about motives must always remain\\".[56] In 2006, William Hogeland argued that Hamilton, Bradford, and Rawle intentionally pursued a course of action that would provoke \\"the kind of violence that would justify federal military suppression\\".[57] According to Hogeland, Hamilton had been working towards this moment since the Newburgh Crisis in 1783, where he conceived of using military force to crush popular resistance to direct taxation for the purpose of promoting national unity and enriching the creditor class at the expense of common taxpayers.[58] Historian S. E. Morison believed that Hamilton, in general, wished to enforce the excise law \\"more as a measure of social discipline than as a source of revenue\\".[59]\\r\\nFederal Marshal Lenox delivered most of the writs without incident. On July 15, he was joined on his rounds by General Neville, who had offered to act as his guide in Allegheny County.[60] That evening, warning shots were fired at the men at the Miller farm, about 10?mi (16?km) south of Pittsburgh. Neville returned home while Lenox retreated to Pittsburgh.[61]\\r\\nOn July 16, at least 30 Mingo Creek militiamen surrounded Neville's fortified home of Bower Hill.[62] They demanded the surrender of the federal marshal, whom they believed to be inside. Neville responded by firing a gunshot that mortally wounded Oliver Miller, one of the \\"rebels\\".[63] The rebels opened fire but were unable to dislodge Neville, who had his slaves' help to defend the house.[64] The rebels retreated to nearby Couch's Fort to gather reinforcements.[65]\\r\\nThe next day, the rebels returned to Bower Hill. Their force had swelled to nearly 600 men, now commanded by Major James McFarlane, a veteran of the Revolutionary War.[66] Neville had also received reinforcements: 10 U.S. Army soldiers from Pittsburgh under the command of Major Abraham Kirkpatrick, Neville's brother-in-law.[67] Before the rebel force arrived, Kirkpatrick had Neville leave the house and hide in a nearby ravine. David Lenox and General Neville's son Presley Neville also returned to the area, though they could not get into the house and were captured by the rebels.[68]\\r\\nFollowing some fruitless negotiations, the women and children were allowed to leave the house, and then both sides began firing. After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a white flag had been waved in the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot rang out from the house, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then set fire to the house, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered.[69] The number of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in the fight.[70] The rebels sent the U.S. soldiers away. Kirkpatrick, Lenox, and Presley Neville were kept as prisoners, but they later escaped.[71]\\r\\nMcFarlane was given a hero's funeral on July 18. His \\"murder\\", as the rebels saw it, further radicalized the countryside.[72] Moderates such as Brackenridge were hard-pressed to restrain the populace. Radical leaders emerged, such as David Bradford, urging violent resistance. On July 26, a group headed by Bradford robbed the U.S. mail as it left Pittsburgh, hoping to discover who in that town opposed them and finding several letters that condemned the rebels. Bradford and his band called for a military assembly to meet at Braddock's Field, about 8?mi (13?km) east of Pittsburgh.[73]\\r\\nOn August 1, about 7,000 people gathered at Braddock's Field.[74] The crowd consisted primarily of poor people who owned no land, and most did not own whiskey stills. The furor over the whiskey excise had unleashed anger about other economic grievances. By this time, the victims of violence were often wealthy property owners who had no connection to the whiskey tax.[75] Some of the most radical protesters wanted to march on Pittsburgh, which they called \\"Sodom\\", loot the homes of the wealthy, and then burn the town to the ground.[76] Others wanted to attack Fort Fayette. There was praise for the French Revolution and calls for bringing the guillotine to America. David Bradford, it was said, was comparing himself to Robespierre, a leader of the French Reign of Terror.[77]\\r\\nAt Braddock's Field, there was talk of declaring independence from the United States and of joining with Spain or Great Britain. Radicals flew a specially designed flag that proclaimed their independence. The flag had six stripes, one for each county represented at the gathering: the Pennsylvania counties of Allegheny, Bedford, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland, and Virginia's Ohio County.[78]\\r\\nPittsburgh citizens helped to defuse the threat by banishing three men whose intercepted letters had given offense to the rebels, and by sending a delegation to Braddock's Field that expressed support for the gathering.[79] Brackenridge prevailed upon the crowd to limit the protest to a defiant march through the town. In Pittsburgh, Major Kirkpatrick's barns were burned, but nothing else.[80]\\r\\nA convention was held on August 14 of 226 whiskey rebels from the six counties, held at Parkison's Ferry (now known as Whiskey Point) in present-day Monongahela. The convention considered resolutions which were drafted by Brackenridge, Gallatin, David Bradford, and an eccentric preacher named Herman Husband, a delegate from Bedford County. Husband was a well-known local figure and a radical champion of democracy who had taken part in the Regulator movement in North Carolina 25 years earlier.[82] The Parkison's Ferry convention also appointed a committee to meet with the peace commissioners who had been sent west by President Washington.[83] There, Gallatin presented an eloquent speech in favor of peace and against proposals from Bradford to further revolt.[81]\\r\\nPresident Washington was confronted with what appeared to be an armed insurrection in western Pennsylvania, and he proceeded cautiously while determined to maintain governmental authority. He did not want to alienate public opinion, so he asked his cabinet for written opinions about how to deal with the crisis. The cabinet recommended the use of force, except for Secretary of State Edmund Randolph who urged reconciliation.[84] Washington did both: he sent commissioners to meet with the rebels while raising a militia army. Washington privately doubted that the commissioners could accomplish anything, and believed that a military expedition would be needed to suppress further violence.[85] For this reason, historians have sometimes charged that the peace commission was sent only for the sake of appearances, and that the use of force was never in doubt.[86] Historians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick argued that the military expedition was \\"itself a part of the reconciliation process\\", since a show of overwhelming force would make further violence less likely.[87]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Hamilton began publishing essays under the name of \\"Tully\\" in Philadelphia newspapers, denouncing mob violence in western Pennsylvania and advocating military action. Democratic-Republican Societies had been formed throughout the country, and Washington and Hamilton believed that they were the source of civic unrest. \\"Historians are not yet agreed on the exact role of the societies\\" in the Whiskey Rebellion, wrote historian Mark Spencer in 2003, \\"but there was a degree of overlap between society membership and the Whiskey Rebels\\".[88]\\r\\nBefore troops could be raised, the Militia Act of 1792 required a justice of the United States Supreme Court to certify that law enforcement was beyond the control of local authorities. On August 4, 1794, Justice James Wilson delivered his opinion that western Pennsylvania was in a state of rebellion.[89] On August 7, Washington issued a presidential proclamation announcing, with \\"the deepest regret\\", that the militia would be called out to suppress the rebellion. He commanded insurgents in western Pennsylvania to disperse by September 1.[90]\\r\\nIn early August 1794, Washington dispatched three commissioners to the west, all of them Pennsylvanians: Attorney General William Bradford, Justice Jasper Yeates of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and Senator James Ross. Beginning on August 21, the commissioners met with a committee of westerners that included Brackenridge and Gallatin. The government commissioners told the committee that it must unanimously agree to renounce violence and submit to U.S. laws, and that a popular referendum must be held to determine if the local people supported the decision. Those who agreed to these terms would be given amnesty from further prosecution.[91]\\r\\nThe committee was divided between radicals and moderates, and narrowly passed a resolution agreeing to submit to the government's terms. The popular referendum was held on September 11 and also produced mixed results. Some townships overwhelmingly supported submitting to U.S. law, but opposition to the government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people predominated.[92] The final report of the commissioners recommended the use of the military to enforce the laws.[93] The trend was towards submission, however, and westerners dispatched representatives William Findley and David Redick to meet with Washington and to halt the progress of the oncoming army. Washington and Hamilton declined, arguing that violence was likely to re-emerge if the army turned back.[92]\\r\\nUnder the authority of the recently passed federal militia law, the state militias were called up by the governors of New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The federalized militia force of 12,950 men was a large army by American standards of the time, comparable to Washington's armies during the Revolution.[94] Relatively few men volunteered for militia service, so a draft was used to fill out the ranks. Draft evasion was widespread, and conscription efforts resulted in protests and riots, even in eastern areas. Three counties in eastern Virginia were the scenes of armed draft resistance. In Maryland, Governor Thomas Sim Lee sent 800 men to quash an antidraft riot in Hagerstown; about 150 people were arrested.[95]\\r\\nLiberty poles were raised in various places as the militia was recruited, worrying federal officials. A liberty pole was raised in Carlisle, Pennsylvania on September 11, 1794.[96] The federalized militia arrived in that town later that month and rounded up suspected pole-raisers. Two civilians were killed in these operations. On September 29, an unarmed boy was shot by an officer whose pistol accidentally fired. Two days later, an \\"Itinerant Person\\" was \\"Bayoneted\\" to death by a soldier while resisting arrest (the man had tried to wrest the rifle from the soldier he confronted; it is possible he had been a member of a 500-strong Irish work crew nearby who were \\"digging, a canal into the Sculkill\\" [sic]; at least one of that work gang's members protested the killing so vigorously that he was \\"put under guard\\").[97] President Washington ordered the arrest of the two soldiers and had them turned over to civilian authorities. A state judge determined that the deaths had been accidental, and the soldiers were released.[98]\\r\\nIn October 1794, Washington traveled west to review the progress of the military expedition. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was \\"the first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\\".[99] Jonathan Forman led the Third Infantry Regiment of New Jersey troops against the Whiskey Rebellion, he wrote about his encounter with Washington:[100]\\r\\nOctober 3d Marched early in the morning for Harrisburgh, where we arrived about 12 O'clock. About 1 O'Clock recd. information of the Presidents approach on which, I had the regiment paraded, timely for his reception, & considerably to my satisfaction. Being afterwards invited to his quarters he made enquiry into the circumstances of the man [an incident between an \\"Itinerant Person\\" and \\"an Old Soldier\\" mentioned earlier in the journal (p. 3)] & seemed satisfied with the information.[97]\\r\\nWashington met with the western representatives in Bedford, Pennsylvania on October 9 before going to Fort Cumberland in Maryland to review the southern wing of the army.[101] He was convinced that the federalized militia would meet little resistance, and he placed the army under the command of the Virginia Governor Henry \\"Lighthorse Harry\\" Lee, a hero of the Revolutionary War. Washington returned to Philadelphia; Hamilton remained with the army as civilian adviser.[102]\\r\\nDaniel Morgan, a general key to the winning of the American Revolution, was called up to lead a force to suppress the protest. It was at this time (1794) that Morgan was promoted to Major General. Serving under General \\"Light-Horse Harry\\" Lee, Morgan led one wing of the militia army into Western Pennsylvania.[103] The massive show of force brought an end to the protests without a shot being fired. After the uprising had been suppressed, Morgan commanded the remnant of the army that remained until 1795 in Pennsylvania, some 1,200 militiamen, one of whom was Meriwether Lewis.[104]\\r\\nThe insurrection collapsed as the federal army marched west into western Pennsylvania in October 1794. Some of the most prominent leaders of the insurrection, such as David Bradford, fled westward to safety. It took six months for those who were charged to be tried. Most were acquitted due to mistaken identity, unreliable testimony and lack of witnesses. The only two convicted of treason and sentenced to hang were John Mitchell and Philip Wigle. They were later pardoned by Washington.[105][106]\\r\\nImmediately before the arrests \\"...?as many as 2,000 of [the rebels]?ÿ had fled into the mountains, beyond the reach of the militia. It was a great disappointment to Hamilton, who had hoped to bring rebel leaders such as David Bradford to trial in Philadelphia?ÿ and possibly see them hanged for treason. Instead, when the militia at last turned back, out of all the suspects they had seized a mere twenty were selected to serve as examples, They were at worst bit players in the uprising, but they were better than nothing.\\"[105]\\r\\nThe captured participants and the Federal militia arrived in Philadelphia on Christmas Day. Some artillery was fired and church bells were heard as \\"...?a huge throng lined Broad Street to cheer the troops and mock the rebels?... [Presley] Neville said he 'could not help feeling sorry for them. The captured rebels were paraded down Broad Street being 'humiliated, bedragged, [and] half-starved?...' \\"[105]\\r\\nOther accounts describe the indictment of 24 men for high treason.[107] Most of the accused had eluded capture, so only ten men stood trial for treason in federal court.[108] Of these, only Philip Wigle[111] and John Mitchell were convicted. Wigle had beaten up a tax collector and burned his house; Mitchell was a simpleton who had been convinced by David Bradford to rob the U.S. mail. Both men were sentenced to death by hanging, but they were pardoned by President Washington.[112] Pennsylvania state courts were more successful in prosecuting lawbreakers, securing numerous convictions for assault and rioting.[113] While violent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, political opposition to the tax continued. Opponents of internal taxes rallied around the candidacy of Thomas Jefferson and helped him defeat President John Adams in the election of 1800. By 1802, Congress repealed the distilled spirits excise tax and all other internal Federal taxes. Until the War of 1812, the Federal government would rely solely on import tariffs for revenue, which quickly grew with the Nation's expanding foreign trade.[22]\\r\\nThe Washington administration's suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion met with widespread popular approval.[114] The episode demonstrated that the new national government had the willingness and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws. It was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians.[115] The Washington administration and its supporters usually did not mention, however, that the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect, and that many westerners continued to refuse to pay the tax.[33] The events contributed to the formation of political parties in the United States, a process already underway.[116] The whiskey tax was repealed after Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party came to power in 1801, which opposed the Federalist Party of Hamilton and Washington.[117]\\r\\nThe Rebellion raised the question of what kinds of protests were permissible under the new Constitution. Legal historian Christian G. Fritz argued that there was not yet a consensus about sovereignty in the United States, even after ratification of the Constitution. Federalists believed that the government was sovereign because it had been established by the people; radical protest actions were permissible during the American Revolution but were no longer legitimate, in their thinking. But the Whiskey Rebels and their defenders believed that the Revolution had established the people as a \\"collective sovereign\\", and the people had the collective right to change or challenge the government through extra-constitutional means.[118]\\r\\nHistorian Steven Boyd argued that the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion prompted anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept the Constitution and to seek change by voting for Republicans rather than resisting the government. Federalists, for their part, came to accept the public's role in governance and no longer challenged the freedom of assembly and the right to petition.[119]\\r\\nSoon after the Whiskey Rebellion, actress-playwright Susanna Rowson wrote a stage musical about the insurrection entitled The Volunteers, with music by composer Alexander Reinagle. The play is now lost, but the songs survive and suggest that Rowson's interpretation was pro-Federalist. The musical celebrates as American heroes the militiamen who put down the rebellion, the \\"volunteers\\" of the title.[120] President Washington and Martha Washington attended a performance of the play in Philadelphia in January 1795.[121] W. C. Fields recorded a comedy track in Les Paul's studio in 1946, shortly before his death, entitled \\"The Temperance Lecture\\" for the album W. C. Fields?... His Only Recording Plus 8 Songs by Mae West. The bit discussed Washington and his role in putting down the Whiskey Rebellion, and Fields wondered aloud whether \\"George put down a little of the vile stuff too.\\"[122]\\r\\nL. Neil Smith wrote the alternate history novel The Probability Broach in 1980 as part of his North American Confederacy Series. In it, Albert Gallatin joins the rebellion in 1794 to benefit the farmers, rather than the fledgling US Government as he did in reality. This results in the rebellion becoming a Second American Revolution. This eventually leads to George Washington being overthrown and executed for treason, the abrogation of the Constitution, and Gallatin being proclaimed the second president and serving as president until 1812.[123][124]\\r\\nDavid Liss' 2008 novel The Whiskey Rebels covers many of the circumstances during 1788-92 that led to the 1794 Rebellion. The fictional protagonists are cast against an array of historical persons, including Alexander Hamilton, William Duer, Anne Bingham, Hugh Henry Brackenridge, Aaron Burr, and Philip Freneau.\\r\\nIn 2011, the Whiskey Rebellion Festival was started in Washington, Pennsylvania. This annual event is held in July and includes live music, food, and historic reenactments, featuring the \\"tar and feathering\\" of the tax collector.[125][126]\\r\\nOther works which include events of the Whiskey Rebellion:\\r\\nMuch primary source historical material has been preserved and exists in archives.

The Deere company briefly experimented with building its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain All-Wheel-Drive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dain All-Wheel Drive was the first tractor produced by John Deere. In 1911, Deere purchased the Dain Manufacturing Company of Ottumwa, Iowa. The next year, Deere decided to design its own tractor, and Dain founder Joseph Dain Sr., was directed to design that tractor. After several prototypes, the design was finalized in 1917, and 100 production units were ordered. By 1919 when that production run was complete, Deere had purchased the Waterloo Boy company. Although the Dain AWD was ahead of its time, with features such as a shift-on-the-fly transmission, Deere halted production in late 1919, partly because the cost of the Dain tractor was double that of the Waterloo Boy, and partly because of the death of Dain Sr.\\r\\nThe predecessor of Waterloo Boy came about in 1892. It was made by thresherman John Froelich. It is called the Froelich tractor. Scale Models of Dyersville, Iowa[1] made a 1/16 scale toy of this tractor. In March 1918 Deere & Company decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor at its facilities in Waterloo, Iowa.\\r\\nDeere & Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923.\\r\\nDespite a rather severe farm economy depression at the time, Deere management decided to build a Model D prototype in 1923, designed by Muir L. Frey (father of Ford Mustang designer Donald N. Frey).[2] The Deere Model D was produced from March 1, 1923 to July 3, 1953, the longest production span of all the two-cylinder John Deere tractors. Over 160,000 were made.[3]\\r\\nThe first Model D rode on steel wheels with a 6.5?in G?7?in (170?mm G?180?mm) (later 6.75?in G?7?in (171?mm G?178?mm)) two-cylinder hand-cranked engine rated 15ÿ27?hp (11ÿ20?kW).[4] It was not, however, the first tractor to bear the Deere name - as a number of Deere experimental tractors, and the John Deere Dain \\"All Wheel Drive\\" tractor (of which approximately 100 were produced during 1918 and 1919) had all carried the Deere name before the D.\\r\\nBy 1925, the company realized the standard Model D did not meet customers' needs for industrial applications. Steel wheels were not suitable for hard surfaces, and the gearing was too slow for safe road speeds. Solid rubber tires were added, and engineers fitted a 28-tooth sprocket to the final drive, giving a road speed of 4?mph (6.4?km/h). The company replaced the 465?cu?in (7.62?l) two-cylinder engine with a 501?cu?in (8.21?l). In 1926, Deere advertised the model as the \\"John Deere Industrial Tractor\\" with 40 G b inch[clarification needed] rear wheels and 24?in G?3.5?in (610?mm G?89?mm) fronts with solid tires. This became known as the \\"DI\\". Options also included wheel weights.[5]\\r\\nOn June 20, 1928, the model designation was changed from \\"C\\" to \\"GP\\" to avoid confusion with the \\"D\\" when dealers were phoning in orders to the factory. \\"GP\\" stands for \\"General Purpose\\". This new model GP had the same horsepower, engine displacement, weight and three-speed transmission as the model C. The GP's first serial number was 200211 . In 1930, the GP was updated with a 25-horsepower, 339 cubic-inch engine.\\r\\nThe John Deere model GP was built in five distinct versions through the course of its production:\\r\\nThe John Deere Model A came off the assembly line in April 1934. The tractor was 25?hp, was 309 CID and had a four-speed transmission. There were eight different model A variations. Some of these were tricycle, hi-crop, orchard, single front tire and industrial models. The tricycle wheel design, patterned after that of the Farmall tractor, reduced steering effort and greatly increased maneuverability. The Model B was introduced in June 1934. This tractor had a shorter frame than the Model A, but it was eventually lengthened so it could use some of the same equipment that the larger models A and G used. There were also eight different Model B tractor variations, the same as the larger Model A.\\r\\nThe much larger G model arrived in 1937. It was fitted with a 36-horsepower, 425-cubic-inch engine and a four-speed transmission. John Deere publicized the G as a three-plow tractor and it was built until 1941 when the GM (G, Modernized) replaced it. The GM model was made from 1942 to 1947. The power was increased to 38 horsepower and a new six-speed transmission was also added. The G model got a restyled front at this point as did the other John Deere tractor models. The GM had electric starting and lighting added to it options. During its production time the G tractor was available as a hi-crop, single front wheel and styled.\\r\\nDeere made their first unstyled rowcrop tractor in 1929 to compete with the Farmall. It was a modified GP tractor with adjustable rear axle track (distance between wheels on the same axle) and a narrow front end. In 1933 Deere started experimenting with what would come to be known as the Model A. The new model A went into production in 1934. The A launched Deere into the rowcrop farming market. The A was by far the most popular two-cylinder tractor that Deere produced. The next year the Model B was introduced. It was one third smaller than the A which made it ideal for smaller farms. A few years later, the Model G was introduced in 1937. It remained unstyled for several more years than the A and B. The unstyled tractors launched Deere into the rowcrop farming market which they are still a major part of today.\\r\\nThe Deere company very nearly went bankrupt in the Great Depression. Only a large order of tractors for the Soviet Union kept the company going.\\r\\nIn 1937 John Deere hired well known industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss from New York City to re-style Deere's agricultural equipment, especially its tractors. In the fall of 1937, a Deere tractor engineer was sent to New York to ask Dreyfuss to redesign the tractors. Legend has it that Dreyfuss was so intrigued by the project that he took a train to Waterloo that very night. Dreyfuss learned to operate the tractors and worked with them in the field to gain firsthand knowledge of the changes that needed to be made. The first two letter series tractors (the A and B) were the first to receive the new modern styling, and other models were added later. The Dreyfuss styling was intended to help John Deere compete with the forthcoming Farmall \\"letter series\\" of tractors, which, along with the Ford-Ferguson, were John Deere's largest competition at this time. Dreyfuss and the Waterloo engineers perfected the styled design that was used on all John Deere tractors with only minor changes through 1959.\\r\\nThe 1930s and 1940s saw a large number of different John Deere models emerge, as small farmers emerging from their Depression troubles increasingly turned from horses to tractors. John Deere's GM model was introduced in 1942, and was made until 1947. Power was increased to 38?hp and a new sjix-speed transmission was also added. The G model got a restyled front at this point as did the other John Deere tractors models. The GM had electric start and lights added to its options. During its production time the G tractor was available in hi-crop and single front wheel versions. The G was restyled in 1941 but did not start to roll off the assembly line until early 1942. Like the smaller A and B tractors the G model had the six-speed transmission added to it. In 1946, the 1946 model \\"D\\" had a 501-cubic-inch engine, which was enormous for the day. Two new additions to the tractor line, the M and R models, were also added.\\r\\nAfter the models A and B got new styling, both tractors were given six-speed transmissions in late 1940. The A was 29?hp out of a 321 CID engine while the smaller B was both 18 and 23?hp reflecting the earlier and later updates between 1938 and 46. The 14.84 model H was given the Dreyfuss look from the time it was introduced in 1938. The H broke a fuel economy record when it was tested in Nebraska. This tractor also had three variations that came out in 1940-'41. The H tractor was 14.84 horsepower out of a 90 CID engine and had a three-speed transmission.\\r\\nIn 1939, the restyled model D appeared. The D was a 42?hp tractor, and weighed 5,300 pounds. Options available on this tractor included electric lighting and starting. In August 1940 John Deere introduced the new model LA which was followed by the model LI. The LA had a 77 CID engine with 14 belt horsepower. The John Deere G tractor was restyled in 1941 but did not start to roll off the assembly line until early 1942. Like the smaller A/B tractors the G model also had the 6-speed transmission, but also featured electric lights and electric start.\\r\\nIn 1947, John Deere opened a new tractor factory in Dubuque, Iowa, built to produce the John Deere M. The M was created to address the increasing demand for small tractors and compete with the increasingly popular Ford and the smaller Farmall tractor models. The M was the first Deere tractor to use a vertical two-cylinder engine, with a square bore and stroke of 4.0 G 4.0?inches (100.5cuin) with a high row crop.\\r\\nAfter years of testing, John Deere released its first proper diesel tractor in 1949, the Model R. The R was also the first Deere tractor with a 'live' independent PTO equipped with its own clutch. The R also incorporated live hydraulics. PowrTrol, as it was known, provided the operator the ability to lift equipment by the pull of a lever. A pump powered by the PTO clutch provided 1800 PSI of hydraulic pressure to a lever controlled valve. At 45?hp at the drawbar and 50?hp at the belt, it was the most fuel-efficient tractor available at the time, and this combination of features resulted in over 21,000 being built. The model R had a shipping weight of 7,670?lb. The R was equipped with two engines. The primary plant is a two-cylinder, four-stroke, naturally aspirated 416 cubic inch (5.75 X 8 bore and stroke) direct injected diesel engine with a 16:1 compression ratio. The starting motor is also a Deere two-cylinder, 26 cubic-inch horizontally opposed gasoline engine. The starting or \\"pony\\" engine is electrically started by a six-volt electrical system, and is used to crank the diesel. Testing results with various electrical starting systems for the diesel proved to be too bulky requiring a 24- or 32-volt system. The design of the pony start Rs allowed for hot exhaust gasses to preheat the intake air for the diesel and a common liquid cooling system allowed the pony engine to warm the diesel block and head. This provided sufficient cold weather starting aids for the diesel that it would reliably run in sub zero conditions. The R did have several teething problems as this was Deere's first production diesel tractor. Available as a standard tractor only, it did not have an adjustable front axle, nor did it have a three-point hitch. The engine was mainly an up-scaled gasoline engine from the Model D. The use of a thermosiphon cooling system and the lack of a three-point bearing crankshaft proved inadequate for diesel compression ratios. The R was prone to overheating and cracking the cylinder head. The lack of a center main bearing in the crankshaft allowed the shaft to flex when used as a stationary powerplant on the belt; this would lead to its failure. The live PTO was directed through (2) 45 bevel gears that proved too small to durably transmit the full torque of the engine. The tractor was fully serviceable at pulling larger equipment efficiently on large acre wheatland farms.\\r\\nDuring the 1950s, the R saw a series of upgrades in the models 80, 820 and 830. The 80 was produced for two years and 3,500 were produced. It had new features, including power steering and dual hydraulics. It developed 68?hp and weighed 8,100 pounds. The 80 also corrected the other design flaws within the R such as using a water pump and pressure radiator cap and the addition of a center crankshaft main bearing.\\r\\nThe 820 and 830 were similar overall, but also differed in their sheet metal exteriors, fuel tank designs and color schemes. The 820, a larger version of the 720 and the 720, was basically the same as the 70, except for the model number and that the sides of the hood are painted JD yellow. The 720 was upgraded to the 730 for 1959. The 730 featured more contoured bodywork than the 720 and came with more ergonomic features for the operator. Although the 730 had a short production run it became one of John Deere's most popular models. The 730 also featured power steering and 24-volt electric starter motor instead of the V4 pony start engine. The 730 was available in diesel, gasoline and LPG as well as in row crop tricycle, row crop wide front, standard tread and hi crop wide front formats. The 730 is very popular with tractor pulling enthusiasts because of its weight, power and slow speed. Plus its good looks have become popular with tractor restorers. The 730 was a 59?hp tractor at the belt and 54 at the drawbar.\\r\\nAfter making more than 1 1?4 million two-cylinder tractors, John Deere switched to four- and six-cylinder engines. Announcement of the change came after seven years of development and forty million dollars in retooling.\\r\\nIn October 1959 the company showcased a new large 215?hp 4WD, called the 8010, on the Robert Ottilie Seed Farm north of Marshalltown, Iowa. It was shown during the largest farming field days event held in Iowa up to that time. Only 100 8010s were built, and 99 of those were rebuilt at the factory and re-released as 8020s in 1960.[6][7]\\r\\nTo introduce its New Generation tractors to all of its dealers in a single day, the company chartered planes to fly more than 5,000 people to Dallas, Texas, on August 30, 1961. Deere put their new tractors on display outside the Cotton Bowl and inside Neiman Marcus. The day would mark the release of a revolutionary line of farm tractors with sleek new styling by Henry Dreyfuss that would soon become the standard all other farm tractors would be measured by.[6] These tractors were the 1010, 2010, 3010 and 4010.\\r\\nThese were soon followed by the model 5010 standard introduced in 1962. The 5010 was the first two-wheel drive to exceed 100?hp at the PTO and drawbar. Designed for the western wheatlands, the 5010 was never available as a row crop model. In 1963 the 3010 and 4010 were replaced by the 3020 and 4020. The 4020 is one of the most popular tractors Deere and company has ever made. The year 1965 brought the 5020 standard, which was the industry's most powerful two-wheel-drive model, along with the 1020, 2020, and 54?hp model 2510. By 1966 Sales of the 4020 accounted for 48% of all John Deere tractor sales.[7] Also that year the row crop version of the 5020 was introduced.\\r\\nIn the late 1960s John Deere pioneered the roll-over protection structure to protect the farmer from injury in the event of a tractor roll-over. John Deere invited the competition to view a demonstration of its new Roll-Guard. Deere recommended that all tractors include this safety feature and offered to share its design and test data with its competitors. Deere also encouraged farmers to retro-fit their tractors with this safety feature, and offered Roll Guards at cost to farmers who wished to install them on their older New Generation tractors.\\r\\nIn 1968 seven new models appeared: the 820, 920, 1520, 2520, 4000, 4520, WA-14, and WA-17. The WA-14 and WA-17 were articulated four-wheel-drive tractors. The 4520 was John Deere's first turbocharged tractor. The 3020 and 4020 were updated with new features, and the 5020 model had a power increase to an industry leading 141?hp. The 4000 was a high horsepower-to-weight tractor, designed to be a \\"runner\\" rather than a \\"lugger\\". The 4000 used the same engine as the popular 4020, but weighed almost 1000?lbs less. According to Deere the 4000 could, in the same amount of time, pull a 4-bottom plow fast enough to cover the same acreage as a 4020 pulling a 5-bottom plow. The John Deere 4000 was also an economy tractor, providing the same horsepower as the 4020 with fewer features and smaller rear axles.\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, John Deere introduced 36 new models. In 1972 John Deere introduced the Generation II tractors. Generation II was characterized by the optional Sound Guard body which was the first truly successful integrated tractor cab. This innovative cab was isolated from the tractor by large rubber bushings which dampened vibrations, and the interior was insulated with foam to reduce noise and protect the operator from extreme temperatures outside. A foam pad on the firewall and sheets of lead under the dash greatly reduced engine noise inside the cab. The Sound Guard body also featured a rounded front windshield with an integrated door. The door post was in line with the exhaust and air intake pipes pipe through the hood for the best forward visibility possible. Fully integrated heating and air conditioning was standard equipment, and it also featured windshield wipers, a dome light, a red interior lamp to illuminate the gear shift levers and hydraulic controls during nighttime operation, and speakers for an optional AM/FM radio which many farmers added because they found the cab so quiet they could actually hear it. When it was introduced it was the quietest tractor cab in the industry and a vast improvement over the aftermarket cabs that John Deere had previously retrofitted to its tractors.\\r\\nThe Generation II tractors also offered other innovative features not available on previous Deere models such as a Quad Range transmission that improved on Deere's proven Synchro Range transmission by adding a high and low gears in each range, and Deere's new Perma-Clutch, a wet clutch that would last much virtually the life of the tractor.\\r\\nJohn Deere introduced at least 38 new tractors during the 1980s during a time when at least 3 other competitors merged, were sold or went out of business altogether:\\r\\nIn some industry watchers were calling Generation 3 the year 1991 brought a glimpse of what John Deere tractors of the 1990s would be like. Eight new tractors were introduced in 1991 starting with the three 5000 Series tractors. These were the 40?hp 5200, 50?hp 5300, and 60?hp 5400. A new model the 92?hp 3055, and 100?hp 3255 followed. John Deere is manufacturing 5000 series of tractors from Sanaswadi, Pune in India, range of products from India are listed below. Additionally, the paint schemes changed in 2007. In 2007, Deere made some HP rating changes in otherwise unchanged machines. The 5103 came with a black engine and drive line prior to 2007 when they began painting the engine area all green. These are referred to as black belly's or green bellies. The black belly 5103 was rated at 50HP, while as is listed below the green belly 5103 was rated at 40HP.\\r\\nFor 1992 model year the 160?hp 4560, the 175?hp 4760, and 202?hp 4960 were introduced. They were nearly identical to the 4555, 4755, and 4955 they replaced with the improvements being improved lighting, hood free of the air intake and exhaust pipe, which was moved to the right corner post of the cab on the 60 series tractors, and an improved cab entry step with handrail.\\r\\nIn the fall of 1992 six totally new 6000/7000 Series tractors were introduced; the 62?hp 6200, 75?hp 6300, 85?hp 6400, 110?hp 7600, 125?hp 7700, and 146?hp 7800. Also the cabs were completely redesigned for better visibility and operator comfort. Deere's new cabs were a significant improvement over the Sound Guard body which had set the industry standard for two decades.\\r\\nThe spring of 1993 the four new 70 Series Power Plus 4WDs were introduced. These were the 250?hp 8570, 300?hp 8770, and a new model the 350?hp 8870. And the first 400-horsepower tractor, the 8970. These tractor were equipped with an electronic power bulge that would kick in when tough field conditions were encountered. Later in the summer the 3055 and 3255 were replaced with the 92?hp 7200 and 100?hp 7400.\\r\\n1994 was a red letter year in tractor development for John Deere because that year brought about the most revolutionary row crop tractors the industry had seen up to then. 1994 was the last year of the Sound Guard body with the last one built being a 2WD 4760 model. It was manufactured on 1994 May 25. This ended a 22-year run for sound guard tractors that were widely regarded as the most successful tractors ever built.\\r\\n1996 saw 13 new tractors debuted at a big dealer meeting in New Mexico.\\r\\nDuring the fall of 1998 John Deere had a 360?hp prototype 9300T track tractor at at least three farm shows. During August 1999 the company had another dealer meeting in Moline, Illinois. It was here that the 360?hp 9300T and 425?hp 9400T were revealed to their dealers. A 115?hp 7510 that came with full four-wheel drive was added. As a result, the 7610 was kicked up to the 120?hp and 7710 up to 135?hp. The 8000/8000T Series tractors were replaced with the 165?hp 8110/8110T, 185?hp 8210/8210T, 205?hp 8310/8310T, and 235?hp 8410/8410T.\\r\\nOne thing the dealers in attendance saw that did not appear at 'Deere.com' until March 2004 was the new 500?hp 9620. The 9620 came after two of their competitors introduced 500?hp 4WDs.\\r\\nIn Columbus the three larger 7000 TEN tractor were replaced with the 140?hp 7720, 155?hp 7820, and the new 170?hp 7920. The 7610 was discontinued.\\r\\nThe Annual dealer meeting was held in Omaha, Nebraska. The Launches included:\\r\\nJohn Deere brought out a lot of new tractors in 2007 with 32 models in all. The year began with the introduction of the 5603 and 5625, both these are 82?hp and are a further extension of the 5003 and 5025 Series tractors.\\r\\nThe big meeting was held in August 2007 in Cincinnati, Ohio. At the Ohio meeting the dealers saw four new nursery and greenhouse tractors which would not appear at 'Deere.com' until February 5, 2008. These would be the;\\r\\nIn the Cincinnati dealer meeting the dealers saw the regular 6030/7030 and the Premium 6030 Series tractors.\\r\\nOn the back of the John Deere publication The Furrow (Summer 2008) is a signup for new equipment. The company had another dealer meeting in late July 2008 to introduce many new utility tractors. But the real announcement came with John Deere introduced a new Worldwide Numbering Scheme for the Entire Line up of Compact and AG Tractors.\\r\\nFrom the 2008 model range on the Engine horsepower will now be advertised in metric (ISO) per the International Organization for Standardization 97/68/EC standard for determining bare engine horsepower at rated engine power in the Model name.\\r\\nFor example, the new 3032E Tractor will be a 3000 with 32?hp on engine. The E is low-spec. This tractor represents the 2007 year 3203 for its spec, not to be mistaken for the 3320 which has the same hp but more features and at a higher price. Over the next few years all Tractors will get this scheme. The issue is that Deere is using Engine hp in the Name, not PTO which is usually less.\\r\\nIn 2008, the first Tractors to get this scheme were the 5D, 5E, 5E Limited edition and the 6D Series tractors. These tractors were introduced at the annual John Deere dealer meeting. This year's event was held in Denver, Colorado.\\r\\nThe biggest tractors in the new range were the 100-140?hp 6D models.\\r\\nAccording to Deere.com the company introduced two new 3E Series tractors. This pair of new 3E Series tractors is on page two of The Furrow, December 2008 edition. Both new 3E models would appear in early October 2008. These would be the 31/25?hp 3032E and 37/30?hp 3038E. The 3032E is powered by a 97 CID diesel while a 91 CID supply's the power on the 3038E. Promagazine.com reports that this pair is for house owners who want a tractor that could take on everyday jobs, some features are: diesel engine, Twin Touch pedals, hydrostatic transmission, standard 4WD, optional cruise control, power steering, a power take-off that is electronically engaged.\\r\\nOn March 17, 2009 Deere.com announced the new 152?hp 7530 Premium tractor. During the week of August 13, 2009 the company had another big dealer meeting in Omaha, Nebraska to introduce the new 8R/8RT row crop and track tractors to their dealers. On August 20, 2009 at Deere.com a news release was posted on the 8R, 8RT and two new 5105M specialty tractors. Six new green-and-yellow 8R row crop tractors 225?hp 8225R, 245?hp 8245R,270?hp 8270R, 295?hp 8295R, 320?hp 8320R and the 345?hp 8345R. PTO ratings are 181, 198, 220, 242, 263 and 284 respectively. The 8225R is the only one available as a two-wheel-drive model. Optional IVT or Powershift Transmissions. In John Deere language the first number=size, the next three numbers are the engine hp and the letter at the end stands for capability. The six tractors range from 225 to 345?hp with the 8345R being the most powerful row crop model on the market. Also shown to the dealers were the new 8RT rubber track tractor models. These three models are the 295?hp 8295RT, 320?hp 8320RT and the 345?hp 8345RT. The T at the end stands for tracks. Other than that the numbers in the 8RT Series are the same in their 8R counterparts. PTO hp for the three 8RT tractors are 239, 260 and 281 respectively.\\r\\nThe 8RT models had their fuel capacity to 200 gallons and can come with track width up to 160?inches. All nine 8R/8RT tractors are powered by the company's 548-cubic-inch PowerTech Plus 6-cylinder diesel engine. Two other lesser known tractors were also introduced by the company are the 5015ML orchard and poultry tractors. The hp is 105 engine and 90 PTO. One version of the 5105ML comes configured to work in orchards and vineyards, while the other version is a low-profile tractor to work in poultry barns.\\r\\nIn August 2010 John Deere had another dealer meeting in Cincinnati, Ohio to introduce still more tractors. This was confirmed at Deere.com on August 26, 2010 with the announcement of more new 8R/8RT Series tractors. These new models are 2011 year tractors with several improvements.\\r\\nThese would be the 8R/8RT Series tractors. These would be the 8235R, 8260R, 8285R, 8310R, 8335R and 8360R wheel tractors ranging from 235 to 360 engine horsepower. The PTO is 192, 213, 234, 25, 276 and 296?hp for the six tractors. Besides the six wheel tractors, three new 8RT track tractors would be added too. There would be the 310-360 engine hp 8310RT. 8335RT and the 8360RT. Power-take off horsepower for is 247, 268 and 288 respectively. One of the major changes with these nine green-and-yellow tractors was the new PowerTech PSX 548-cubic-inch dual turbocharged diesel. This is an Interim Tier 4 (IT4) diesel engine. On January 1, 2011 EPA Tier 4 regulations will begin thus the new PowerTech diesel in these tractors. Despite their competitors going with SCR to counter this John Deere will be using EGR-Exhaust Gas Recirculation. To tell these new 8R tractors apart from the 2010 tractors John Deere put new wrap-around lights up front. Also the model number has been moved close to the front just off the black grill on both sides .Another characteristic is the new large black muffler on the right corner of the cab.\\r\\nOther improvements engineered into these tractors are JDLink, ActiveCommand Steering (ACS), Infinitely Variable Transmission (IVT) AutoMode, GS3 CommandCenter and the StarFire 3000 Receiver. In a 2010 October meeting in Florida John Deere dealers were shown the new 1023E & 1026E sub compact tractors that the company will announce in February 2011.","input":"Where was the first john deere tractor made?"},{"output":"Twenty-six countries","context":"The Eurovision Song Contest 2017 was the 62nd edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in the International Exhibition Centre in Kiev, Ukraine, following Ukraine's victory at the 2016 contest in Stockholm with the song \\"1944\\", written and performed by Jamala. This was the second time the contest took place in Kiev, after 2005, as well as the fourth Eurovision event, after the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2009 and 2013. The contest consisted of two semi-finals on 9 and 11 May, and a final on 13 May 2017. All three live shows were hosted by Oleksandr Skichko, Volodymyr Ostapchuk and Timur Miroshnychenko.\\r\\nForty-two countries participated in the contest. Portugal and Romania returned to the contest after a year's absence, while Bosnia and Herzegovina withdrew on financial grounds. Russia had originally planned to participate, but announced their withdrawal on 13 April 2017, after their representative, Yulia Samoylova, was banned from entering Ukraine by virtue of having travelled directly from Russia to Crimea in 2015, a region that was annexed by Russia in 2014, to give a performance, which is illegal under Ukrainian law.\\r\\nThe winner was Portugal with the song \\"Amar pelos dois\\" (Loving For Both of Us), performed by Salvador Sobral and written by his sister Lusa Sobral. This was Portugal's first win ÿ and first top five placing ÿ in 53 years of participation, the longest winless run by a country in Eurovision history. It was also the first winning song entirely performed in a country's native language since Serbia's \\"Molitva\\" in 2007, and the first winner written in triple metre since Ireland's \\"The Voice\\" in 1996. Additionally, this was the second consecutive year in which a returning country won the contest following Ukraine's victory in 2016. The top three countries ÿ Portugal, Bulgaria and Moldova ÿ achieved the highest placing in their Eurovision history, while host country Ukraine received its worst placing to date in a Eurovision final. The 2017 edition also saw the worst results for Serbia, Montenegro, Latvia, Spain and San Marino.

The International Exhibition Centre has a capacity of approximately 11,000 attendees and is the largest exhibition centre in Kiev.[1] Located in the western part of the Livoberezhna microdistrict, the centre was opened in October 2002, and its head since its construction was Anatoly Tkachenko.[1]\\r\\nThe Deputy Chief of host broadcaster National Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine (UA:PBC) and Head of Delegation for Ukraine, Viktoria Romanova, stated on 18 May 2016 that the first organisational meeting for the contest would take place before 8 June, during which the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and UA:PBC would go through the technical requirements for the contest, as well as any training required for the contest to take place in Ukraine. Romanova also announced that the venue for the contest would be announced over the summer.[2][3][4]\\r\\nUA:PBC and the Ukrainian Government formally launched the bidding process for interested cities to apply to host the contest on 23 June.[5][6] The selection of the host city was scheduled to be conducted in four stages:\\r\\nThe following criteria were outlined for the selection of the host city:[7]\\r\\nSix cities submitted applications by the deadline of 8 July: Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kiev, Lviv and Odessa.[8] Prior to the opening of the bidding process, the cities of Cherkasy, Irpin, Uzhhorod and Vinnytsia had declared their interest in hosting the contest, but did not submit a formal bid.[9][10] Ukrainian Culture Minister Yevhen Nyshchuk stated on 30 June that an appropriate venue for the contest does not exist in Ukraine, suggesting that the construction of a new venue in Kiev or Lviv should be considered.[11]\\r\\nThe six candidate cities were officially presented to the LOC on 20 July in a two-hour live discussion show titled City Battle, broadcast from the UA:Pershyi studios in Kiev and moderated by Timur Miroshnychenko, with radio commentary from Olena Zelinchenko. The show was broadcast on UA:Pershyi, Radio Ukraine and the UA:Pershyi YouTube channel with commentary in English and Ukrainian. During the show, a representative from each candidate city presented its bid in front of a live studio audience:[12]\\r\\nMembers of the LOC, media representatives, Ukrainian musical experts and fans also participated in the discussion.\\r\\nUA:PBC announced on 22 July that the bids from Dnipro, Kiev and Odessa had been shortlisted for further consideration.[13]\\r\\nThe EBU announced on 30 July that the host city would be announced \\"in due course\\", rather than on the previously stated date of 1 August, with Executive Supervisor of the contest Jon Ola Sand stating that the EBU \\"really want to take the time it takes to come up with the right decision\\".[14] The Deputy General Director of UA:PBC, Oleksandr Kharebin, stated on 10 August that the host city would be announced on Ukrainian Independence Day, 24 August.[15] The announcement was later scheduled to take place on 25 August; however, it was postponed at 14:00 EEST, one hour before it was due to take place, with NTU citing the need to further consider some fine details regarding the decision.[16]\\r\\nAfter several delays in announcing the host city, UA:PBC announced on 8 September that they would be meeting with the Ukrainian Government and the LOC on 9 September and that a press conference to announce the host city was scheduled to take place at 13:00 EEST on the same day from the Government Press Centre in Kiev. Kiev was announced as the host city for the contest with the International Exhibition Centre selected as the venue.[17][18]\\r\\nKey ???? Host venue ???? Shortlisted\\r\\nThe preliminary dates for the contest were announced on 14 March 2016 at a meeting of Heads of Delegation in Stockholm, with the semi-finals expected to take place on 16 and 18 May and the final on 20 May 2017. These preliminary dates were chosen by the EBU to avoid the contest coinciding with any major television and sporting events scheduled to take place around that time.[30]\\r\\nHowever, the EBU announced on 24 June that the preliminary dates for the contest had been brought forward a week, with the semi-finals scheduled for 9 and 11 May and the final on 13 May.[5] This was reportedly due to a request from UA:PBC, as the initial preliminary dates coincided with the Remembrance Day for the victims of the Deportation of the Crimean Tatars on 18 May.[31][32] However, the current dates coincide with the second leg of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League semi-finals.[32]\\r\\nThe draw to determine the allocation of the participating countries into their respective semi-finals took place at Column Hall on 31 January 2017, hosted by Timur Miroshnychenko and Nika Konstantinova. The thirty-seven semi-finalists had been allocated into six pots, based on historical voting patterns as calculated by the contest's official televoting partner Digame. Drawing from different pots helps to reduce the chance of so-called \\"bloc voting\\" and increase suspense in the semi-finals.[33]\\r\\nThe theme for the contest, Celebrate Diversity, was unveiled on 30 January. Executive Supervisor for the contest, Jon Ola Sand, explained that \\"[t]he notion of celebrating diversity is at the heart of Eurovision values From EAMV Recording Label: it is all-inclusive and all about countries around Europe, and beyond, joining together to celebrate both our common ground and our unique differences, as well as some great music.\\" The logo and visual design of the contest incorporates imagery of stylized beads, with the main logo using the beads to form a traditional neck amulet.[34][35]\\r\\nIt was announced on 27 February that the presenters for the contest would be Oleksandr Skichko and Volodymyr Ostapchuk, with Timur Miroshnychenko hosting the green room.[36] It was the first time that the contest will be presented by a male trio,[36] and the second time that the contest does not feature a female presenter, after 1956. Miroshnychenko has previously co-hosted the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2009 and 2013.[37][38]\\r\\nIt was announced on 30 April that the creative teams from both the Eurovision network and Twitter had worked together to create three emoji that would accompany specific promotional hashtags for the duration of the contest. The heart emoji would appear alongside #ESC2017 and #Eurovision, while the winners' trophy emoji would be used for #12Points and #douzepoints. The final emoji is the logo for the contest, which would appear alongside the hashtag #CelebrateDiversity, the theme for the contest.[39]\\r\\nThe EBU released details regarding the opening and interval acts for each of the live shows on 20 April.[40] As the interval act of the first semi-final, Jamala performed a revamped version of \\"1944\\" as well as \\"Zamanyly\\" (Ukrainian: \\"yҶ\\").[40] The second semi-final was opened with a medley of Eurovision songs by two of the presenters, Oleksandr Skichko and Volodymyr Ostapchuk, while the interval of the semi-final was a dance performance by Apache CREW called \\"The Children's Courtyard\\". In the final, Jamala again performed, this time doing \\"I Believe in U\\".[40] ONUKA and Ukraine's National Academic Orchestra of Folk Instruments also performed.[41]\\r\\nThe European Broadcasting Union announced on 31 October 2016 that forty-three countries would participate in the contest, equalling the record set in 2008 and 2011. Portugal and Romania returned after a year's absence, while Bosnia and Herzegovina withdrew on financial grounds.[42] Russia had originally planned to participate but announced their withdrawal on 13 April 2017, after their representative, Yulia Samoylova, was banned from entering Ukraine by virtue of travelling directly from Russia to Crimea, a region that was annexed by Russia in 2014, to give a performance, which is illegal under Ukrainian law. This subsequently reduced the number of participating countries to forty-two.[43][44]\\r\\nThe contest featured five representatives who also previously performed as lead vocalists for the same countries. Valentina Monetta, who performed in a duet this time, represented San Marino in three consecutive editions: 2012, 2013, and 2014. The duo of Koit Toome and Laura P?ldvere have both represented Estonia in different years: Toome in 1998 as a solo artist, finishing 12th place with the song \\"Mere lapsed\\", and P?ldvere in 2005 as part of Suntribe, finishing 20th in the semi-final with the song \\"Let's Get Loud\\". Omar Naber represented Slovenia in 2005, finishing 12th in the semi-final with the song \\"Stop\\".[45] The SunStroke Project represented Moldova in 2010 alongside Olia Tira, finishing 22nd with the song \\"Run Away\\".[46]\\r\\nThe contest also featured the group O'G3NE which previously represented the Netherlands at another Eurovision event, the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2007, as Lisa, Amy and Shelley, with the song \\"Adem in, Adem Uit\\".[47] In addition, the contest featured two lead singers previously participating as backing vocalists for the same countries. Israel's representative Imri Ziv who backed Nadav Guedj in 2015 and Hovi Star in 2016,[48] and Serbia's representative Tijana Bogi?evi? who backed Nina in 2011.\\r\\nEighteen countries participated in the first semi-final. Italy, Spain and United Kingdom voted in this semi-final.[49] The highlighted countries qualified for the final.[50]\\r\\nEighteen countries participated in the second semi-final. France, Germany and Ukraine voted in this semi-final.[49] Russia was originally planned to perform in position three, but withdrew from the contest after the artist they selected was banned from entering Ukraine, resulting in countries originally planned to perform fourth and later, to do so one place earlier.[43] The highlighted countries qualified for the final.[53]\\r\\nTwenty-six countries participated in the final, with all 42 participating countries eligible to vote.

The EBU announced on 9 May, that all three shows would also be streamed live via YouTube.[92]\\r\\nFrance 2 announced on 9 February 2017 that they would participate at the contest with the song \\"Requiem\\", performed by Alma.[150] However, it was discovered during the week of 17 February \\"Requiem\\" had been recorded and performed prior to 1 September 2016, the submission deadline set by the EBU, potentially violating the rules of the contest.[151] Further investigation shows that \\"Requiem\\" had been performed at the end of January 2015.[152] While France 2 had claimed not to be in breach of the rules of the contest, no ultimate decision had been made regarding their potential disqualification.[152] It was reported on 21 February 2017 that Alma and her production team were producing a bilingual version of \\"Requiem\\"the two languages being French and Englishwhich implies that France 2 have not been disqualified from the contest.[153]\\r\\nChannel One Russia (C1R) announced on 12 March 2017 that they would participate at the contest with \\"Flame Is Burning\\", performed by Julia Samoylova. However, Samoylova was issued a three-year travel ban on entering Ukraine by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on 22 March,[154] by virtue of illegally travelling directly from Russia to Crimea, a region that was annexed by Russia in 2014, in 2015 to give a performance.[155][156] Entry to Crimea by non-Ukrainian citizens via Russia is illegal under Ukrainian law;[155] however, Samoylova confirmed that she performed in Crimea in 2015.[157][158][159]\\r\\nThe EBU responded by stating its commitment to ensuring that all participating countries would be able to perform in Kiev, while expressing their disappointment at the lack of compromise from C1R and UA:PBC.[160] C1R were offered the opportunity to allow Samoylova to perform via satellite from a venue of their choice,[161] but such a compromise was rejected by both C1R and the Ukrainian Government.[162][163]\\r\\nThe Director General of the EBU, Ingrid Deltenre, condemned Ukraine's actions, describing them as \\"abusing the Contest for political reasons\\" and \\"absolutely unacceptable\\"[164] C1R announced their withdrawal from the contest on 13 April, stating that they also might not broadcast the contest.[43][165][44] C1R had not organised accommodation before their artist announcement, as is typically the case, and refused to attend the meeting of Heads of Delegation. By announcing their artist just before the deadline for entry submission to the contest and not booking a hotel, it was speculated that C1R had not intended to go due to audiences booing Russian artists in previous contests.[166]\\r\\nAs part of the Russian Victory Day celebrations on 9 May, Samoylova gave another performance in Crimea, including the song which was intended to represent Russia at the contest.[167]\\r\\nUnder a proposal by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, the Israeli Broadcasting Authority (IBA) is currently being reorganised into two separate entities: the Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation (IPBC), with responsibility for \\"general programming\\" such as entertainment, and another with responsibility for news and current affairs programming. The IPBC would also be branded as \\"KAN\\" (Hebrew: ????, lit.?'Here'?). The EBU informed the IPBC executive board on 7 April that such a compromise would render them unable to remain a member without an outlet for news and current events programming. It has been reported that the IBA may cease to be a member of the EBU.[168]\\r\\nThe IBA was expected to close down on 15 May 2017 before the IPBC was expected to launch. However, on 9 and 10 May 2017 the IBA unexpectedly closed down most of their operations in news and current affair programs.[169] This Eurovision was the last program that Channel 1 aired under the IBA, where minimal staff of twenty people remained to ensure a smooth transmission on Channel 1.[117][170] After the Eurovision the station displayed a slide about its closure. During the voting portion of the live telecast of the final Ofer Nachshon, Israeli voting spokesperson since 2009, bid farewell on behalf of the IBA before revealing their jury points.[171] This was incorrectly reported by several British media outlets and in other countries as Israel leaving the Contest.[171][172]\\r\\nIPBC is expected to apply for EBU membership later this year and if accepted, Israel will continue to participate.[173] The government passed a law splitting new corporation into two entities - one in charge for entertainment programs and the second is for news, which may create an obstacle for either entity joining EBU. However, the High Court of Justice issued a temporary injunction, blocking the split. If the split is cancelled permanently, the new Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation meets all requirements for joining EBU.[174]\\r\\nNorsk rikskringkasting (NRK) had discussions with the EBU regarding the abolition of the rule prohibiting pre-recorded vocals during live performances at the contest. Such a rule is intended to guarantee the authenticity of live performances.[175] The discussion stems from when Norwegian representative JOWST stated his displeasure at the rule in an interview on 24 March, in reference to the sampling technique of chopped vocals in his song \\"Grab the Moment\\" which cannot be attributed in the live performance.[175]\\r\\nSuch discussions were also in place in 1999, when pre-recorded vocals during the Croatian entry, \\"Marija Magdalena\\", performed by Doris Dragovi?, led to objections by the Norwegian delegation  led at the time by Jon Ola Sand. Such objections led the EBU to consider deducting a third of Croatia's final score, reducing it from 118 points to 79. However, such a deduction never occurred.[citation needed] The possible abolition of the rule, alongside the abolition of the live orchestra in 1999, has led some fans and critics of the contest to argue that the contest has become too commercialised and the authenticity of live performances has been compromised.[175]\\r\\nAfter discussing the matter with the EBU, NRK were granted an exception to the rule. JOWST stated that \\"[the Norwegian delegation] have now been allowed to use the recorded vocal tracks, [...]. But [they] have also practiced a plan B with the backing vocalists, if there are big protests from others in Kiev.\\"[176] Both JOWST and Aleksander Walmann think that had \\"Grab the Moment\\" been in the semi-final of the 2018 contest following an abolition of the rule, they would have had an advantage. NRK stated on 2 May that JOWST are aiming to perform the song acoustically as a back-up, bringing with them two additional backing vocalists who will perform the pre-recorded vocals live using a filter applied by the sound engineering team so as not to compromise on sound quality.[177]\\r\\nNorwegian jury member Per Sundnes made comments on NRK preview show Adresse Kiev on 17 April 2017 against Irish representative Brendan Murray, saying: \\"It's been a long time since they've gotten up and I do not think they'll do it again. They try the same formula year after year.\\"[178] The comments were not welcomed by the Irish delegation, who subsequently reported the matter to the EBU.[179]\\r\\nThe Irish Independent reported on 8 May that Sundnes had been replaced due to an alleged breach in jury rules. Commenting on the decision, the Head of Delegation for Ireland, Michael Kealy, said: \\"I'm glad that the European Broadcasting Union have reacted swiftly to this situation and that all jury members are impartial. It's only fair that each song in the Eurovision Song Contest is judged on its individual merits on the night.\\" Sundnes was subsequently replaced by Erland Bakke.[180]\\r\\nSundnes stated in an interview with Verdens Gang on 9 May: \\"I do not know anything about the jury stuff, just that I'm not [in it]. It was not really surprising. The same thing happened in Sweden last year with the Swedish professional jury.\\"[181]\\r\\nNRK admits that they made a mistake by letting Sundnes sit in both the professional jury and the judging panel of Adresse Kiev. However, when they were informed by the EBU that this was against the rules, they rectified the situation quickly. Project manager for Melodi Grand Prix, Stig Karlsen, stated: \\"We have received some concerns from several teams that Per has been in the jury, while at the same time he has been meaningful in the program. Therefore, we took a new assessment.\\".[182]\\r\\nOn 11 May 2017, during the transmission of the second semi-final, the microphone of the Estonian representative seemed to have malfunctioned as singer Laura P?ldvere could not be heard for approximately two seconds by viewers at home. It was later revealed that the Estonian delegation considered appealing to the EBU to allow Laura and Koit Toome to perform their entry \\"Verona\\" again as a result of the error, but later decided against it. Mart Normet, the Head of Delegation for Estonia, explained \\"If there has been such a powerful performance for three minutes and given an absolute maximum, then this energy again does not come back when you go on stage again\\". The EBU responded to the situation, reportedly describing the error as purely technical, as the microphone was supposed to automatically come on. Instead, a sound technician was forced to respond by manually switching on the microphone via the sound desk.[183] The country ultimately failed to reach the grand final, with P?ldvere expressing her annoyance, however stating \\"I do not think its so tremendously influenced when a few words remain unheard\\".[184]\\r\\nPortugal's representative, Salvador Sobral drew attention to the European migrant crisis by turning up to the first semi-final winners' press conference in an \\"S.O.S. Refugees\\" shirt.[185] \\"If I'm here and I have European exposure, the least thing I can do is a humanitarian message\\", Sobral said. \\"People come to Europe in plastic boats and are being asked to show their birth certificates in order to enter a country. These people are not immigrants, they're refugees running from death. Make no mistake. There is so much bureaucratic stuff happening in the refugee camps in Greece, Turkey and Italy and we should help create legal and safe pathways from these countries to their destiny countries\\", he added, earning a round of applause.[186] Later on, EBU ordered a ban so that he could not wear it for the remainder of the contest.[187] The EBU explained that Sobral's jumper was used as a means of \\"political message,\\" which violates the rules of the contest.[187] However, Sobral argued in his winning press conference that it was not political, but a message of humanitarianism.[188]\\r\\nA performance by Jamala during the voting interval of the final was disrupted by a man draped in an Australian flag who invaded the stage and briefly mooned the audience before being removed by security.[189] He was later identified as Ukrainian prankster Vitalii Sediuk.[190] Following the incident the EBU released a statement reading: \\"A person took to the stage at the beginning of Jamalas performance of I Believe in U at tonights Eurovision Song Contest in Kyiv. He was quickly removed from the stage by security and out of the arena. He is currently being held and questioned by the police at the venue police office.\\" The last time an unauthorised person gained access to the stage was in 2010 when the Spanish performance was disrupted by Jimmy Jump.[191]\\r\\nThe Marcel Bezen?on Awards, the OGAE voting poll and the Barbara Dex Awards are awards that will be contested by the entries competing at the Eurovision Song Contest 2017, in addition to the main winner's trophy.\\r\\nThe Marcel Bezen?on Awards were first handed out during the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 in Tallinn, Estonia, honouring the best competing songs in the final. Founded by Christer Bj?rkman (Sweden's representative in the Eurovision Song Contest 1992 and the current Head of Delegation for Sweden) and Richard Herrey (a member of the Herreys and the Eurovision Song Contest 1984 winner from Sweden), the awards are named after the creator of the annual competition, Marcel Bezen?on.[192] The awards are divided into three categories: Press Award, Artistic Award, and Composer Award. The winners were revealed shortly before the final on 13 May.[193]\\r\\nOrganisation Gnrale des Amateurs de l'Eurovision (more commonly known as OGAE) is an international organisation that was founded in 1984 in Savonlinna, Finland by Jari-Pekka Koikkalainen.[194] The organisation consists of a network of over 40 Eurovision Song Contest fan clubs across Europe and beyond, and is a non-governmental, non-political, and non-profit company.[195] In what has become an annual tradition for the OGAE fan clubs, a voting poll will run prior to the main Eurovision Song Contest allowing members from over 40 clubs to vote for their favourite songs of the contest. The OGAE Poll 2017 ran from 1 to 30 April 2017, and published daily by the official OGAE International website.[196] Italy won the poll receiving a total of four-hundred and ninety-seven points, from forty-four OGAE member clubs.[197]\\r\\n*Table reflects the 2017 voting results from all forty-four OGAE member clubs.\\r\\nThe Barbara Dex Award is a fan award originally awarded by House of Eurovision from 1997 to 2016, and since 2017 by songfestival.be. This is a humorous award given to the worst dressed artist each year in the contest, and was named after the Belgian artist, Barbara Dex, who came last in the 1993, in which she wore her own self designed dress. This was the first year that songfestival.be awarded the Barbara Dex Award.\\r\\nEurovision Song Contest: Kyiv 2017 is the official compilation album of the contest, put together by the European Broadcasting Union and was released by Universal Music Group digitally on 21 April and physically on 28 April 2017.[199] The album features all 42 participating entries, including the semi-finalists that failed to qualify for the final, and the Russian entry which withdrew from the contest on 13 April 2017.[200][43][201] This is the second consecutive year that the official album featured a song which had withdrawn before the contest.","input":"How many countries are there in the eurovision song contest final?"},{"output":"6 March 1987","context":"MS Herald of Free Enterprise was a roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferry which capsized moments after leaving the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on the night of 6 March 1987, killing 193 passengers and crew.[1]\\r\\nThe modern 8-deck car and passenger ferry, owned by Townsend Thoresen, had been designed for rapid loading and unloading on the competitive cross-channel route, and there were no watertight compartments. When the ship left harbour with its bow-door open, the sea immediately flooded the decks, and within minutes it was lying on its side in shallow water.\\r\\nAlthough the immediate cause of the sinking was found to be negligence by the assistant boatswain, who was asleep in his cabin when he should have been closing the bow-door, the official inquiry placed more blame on his supervisors and a general culture of poor communication in Townsend Thoresen.\\r\\nThe vessel was salvaged and put up for sale, and on September 30, 1987, was sold to Naviera SA Kingstown, and was renamed Flushing Range. Then on March 22, 1988, she was taken to Taiwan to be broken up.\\r\\nSince the disaster, improvements have been made to the design of RORO vessels, with watertight ramps, indicators showing the position of the bow-doors, and the banning of undivided decks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, Townsend Thoresen commissioned the design and construction of three new identical ships for its DoverÿCalais route for delivery from 1980. The ships were branded the Spirit-class and were named Herald of Free Enterprise, Pride of Free Enterprise and Spirit of Free Enterprise.[2] The name \\"Free Enterprise\\" dates from Townsend Car Ferries' pioneering private sector roll on/roll off ferries, introduced in 1962.[3] The Herald began active service on 29 May 1980.[4]\\r\\nTo remain competitive with other ferry operators on the route, Townsend Thoresen required ships designed to permit fast loading and unloading and quick acceleration. The ships comprised eight decks numbered A to H from top to bottom which contained the following:[5]\\r\\nLoading of vehicles onto G deck was through watertight doors at the bow and stern.[6] The wheel house was positioned towards the stern, making it difficult to see the bow doors.[7] Loading of vehicles onto E deck and F deck was through a weathertight door at the bow and an open portal at the stern. Vehicles could be loaded and unloaded onto E and G deck simultaneously using double-deck linkspans in use at Dover and Calais.[8]\\r\\nThe ships were constructed by Schichau-Unterweser AG in Bremerhaven, Germany. Propulsive power was by means of three 8000bhp 12-cylinder Sulzer medium-speed diesel engines driving variable-pitch propellers.[9] The vehicle deck bow doors were constructed by Cargospeed, Glasgow, Scotland.[4]\\r\\nOn the day the ferry capsized, Herald of Free Enterprise was working the route between Dover and the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. This was not her normal route and the linkspan at Zeebrugge had not been designed specifically for the Spirit-class vessels: she used a single deck, preventing the simultaneous loading of both E and G decks, and the ramp could not be raised high enough to reach E deck.[10][11] To compensate for this, the vessel's bow ballast tanks were filled.[10] However, the ship's natural trim was not restored after loading.[10] Had Herald of Free Enterprise survived, she would have been modified to obviate the need for this procedure.[11]\\r\\nIt was normal practice for the assistant boatswain to close the doors before moorings were dropped. However, the assistant boatswain, Mark Stanley, had returned to his cabin for a short break after cleaning the car deck upon arrival, and was still asleep when the harbour-stations call sounded and the ship dropped her moorings.[12] The first officer, Leslie Sabel, was required to stay on deck to make sure the doors were closed.[13] Sabel said he thought he saw Stanley approaching. He was seriously injured in the disaster and the court concluded that his evidence was inaccurate.[13] It is believed that, under pressure to get to his harbour station on the bridge, he had left G deck with the bow doors open in the expectation that Stanley would arrive shortly.[13] The court also described the attitude of boatswain Terence Ayling, believed to have been the last person on G deck, as most unfortunate.[13] Asked why he did not close the doors given there was no one else there to do it, he said it was not his duty.[13] However the court praised his work in the rescue.[13]\\r\\nCaptain David Lewry assumed that the doors had been closed since he could not see them from the wheelhouse owing to the ship's design, and had no indicator lights in the wheelhouse.[14]\\r\\nThe ship left her berth in Zeebrugge inner harbour at 18:05 (GMT) with a crew of 80 and carrying 459 passengers, 81 cars, 3 buses and 47 trucks. She passed the outer mole at 18:24 (GMT) and capsized about four minutes later.[15]\\r\\nWhen the ferry reached 18.9 knots (35.0?km/h; 21.7?mph) 90 seconds after leaving the harbour, water began to enter the car deck in large quantities. The resulting free surface effect destroyed her stability.[16]\\r\\nIn a matter of seconds, the ship began to list 30 degrees to port.[17] The ship briefly righted herself before listing to port once more, this time capsizing.[17] The entire event took place within 90 seconds.[18] The water quickly reached the ship's electrical systems, destroying both main and emergency power and leaving the ship in darkness.[16]\\r\\nThe ship ended on her side half-submerged in shallow water 1 kilometre (0.5?nmi; 0.6?mi) from the shore. Only a fortuitous turn to starboard in her last moments, and then capsizing on a sandbar, prevented the ship from sinking entirely in much deeper water.[16]\\r\\nCrew aboard a nearby dredger noticed Herald of Free Enterprise's lights disappear, and notified the port authorities. The alarm was raised at 19:37 local time (18:37 GMT).[19] Rescue helicopters were quickly dispatched, shortly followed by assistance from the Belgian Navy, who were undertaking an exercise within the area.[20] Wolfgang Schr?der?(de), the German captain of a nearby ferry,[21] was commended by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and received a medal from King Baudouin of Belgium for his heroic efforts in rescuing passengers.[22]\\r\\nThe disaster resulted in the deaths of 193 people. Many of those on board had taken advantage of a promotion in The Sun newspaper offering cheap trips to the continent.[23] Most of the victims were trapped inside the ship and succumbed to hypothermia because of the frigid water.[24] The rescue efforts of the Belgian Navy limited the death toll. Recoverable bodies were removed in the days following the accident. During the rescue the tide started to rise and the rescue team was forced to stop all efforts until morning. The last of the people left on board died of hypothermia.[25]\\r\\nA public Court of Inquiry into the incident was held under British judge Lord Justice Barry Sheen in 1987.[26] It found the sinking was caused by three main factorsStanley's failure to close the bow doors, Sabel's failure to make sure the bow doors were closed, and Lewry leaving port without knowing whether the bow doors were closed. While the court determined the immediate cause of the sinking was Stanley's failure to close the bow doors, it was very critical of Sabel for not being in a position to prevent the disaster, calling his actions \\"the most immediate\\" cause of the sinking.[13]\\r\\nThe fact that Stanley was asleep at the time of departure led Sheen to examine the working practices of Townsend Thoresen, from which he concluded that the poor workplace communication and stand-off relationship between ship operators and shore-based managers was the root cause of the sinking,[12] and identified a \\"disease of sloppiness\\" and negligence at every level of the corporation's hierarchy.[27] Issues relating to the breaking of waves high on the bow doors while under way and requests to have an indicator installed on the bridge showing the position of the doors were dismissed; the former because of the attitude that ships' masters would come and \\"bang on the desk\\" if an issue was truly important, and the latter because it was thought frivolous to spend money on equipment to indicate if employees had failed to do their job correctly.[14]\\r\\nThe design of Herald of Free Enterprise was also found to be a contributory cause of the sinking.[12] Unlike other ships, which are subdivided into watertight compartments, the vehicle decks of RORO vessels are normally contiguous: any flooding on these decks would allow the water to flow the length of the ship.[10] This issue had been identified as early as 1980, following the losses of Seaspeed Dora and Hero in June and November 1977 respectively.[28] The need to adjust the ship's bow trim to use the port facilities at Zeebrugge and failure to readjust before departure was another factor in the sinking.[18]\\r\\nIn October 1983, Herald of Free Enterprise's sister ship Pride of Free Enterprise had sailed from Dover to Zeebrugge with the bow doors open, after her assistant boatswain fell asleep.[13] It was therefore believed that leaving the bow doors open alone should not have caused the ship to capsize. However, tests by the Danish Maritime Institute after the accident found that once water began to enter the vehicle deck of a RORO, it was likely that the vessel would capsize within 30 minutes, while other tests showed that the lack of watertight subdivision common on other vessels allowed the weight of water to flow freely and increase the likelihood of capsizing.[18]\\r\\nAnother factor that contributed to the capsizing was the \\"squat effect\\". When a vessel is under way, the movement under it creates low pressure, which has the effect of increasing the vessel's draught. In deep water the effect is small but in shallow water it is greater, because as the water passes underneath it moves faster and causes the draught to increase. This reduced the clearance between the bow doors and water line to between 1.5 metres (4.9?ft) and 1.9 metres (6.2?ft). After extensive tests, the investigators found that when the ship travelled at a speed of 18 knots (33?km/h), the wave was enough to engulf the bow doors. This caused a \\"step change\\": if the ship had been sailing at less than 18 knots and not in shallow water, people on the car deck would probably have had time to notice the bow doors were open and close them.[29]\\r\\nIn October 1987, a coroner's inquest jury into the capsizing returned verdicts of unlawful killing. Seven people involved at the company were charged with gross negligence manslaughter, and the operating company, P&O European Ferries (Dover) Ltd, was charged with corporate manslaughter, but the case collapsed after Justice Turner directed the jury to acquit the company and the five most senior individual defendants.[30] It did, however, set a precedent that corporate manslaughter is legally admissible in English courts. The disaster was one of a number that influenced thinking leading to the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.[31]\\r\\nA salvage operation, conducted by Dutch company Smit-Tak Towage and Salvage (part of Smit International), was embarked upon almost immediately to refloat the ship. The operation was successfully concluded in late April 1987, allowing the remaining bodies trapped underwater to be removed. The ship was towed to Zeebrugge, and then across the Western Scheldt to the yard of De Schelde in Flushing, where her fate was decided. It had originally been assumed that she could be repaired and continue sailing. However, no buyer was found; she was sold to Compania Naviera SA of Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, for scrapping. She was renamed Flushing Range and the Townsend Thoresen branding painted over before her final sailing to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for scrapping.[32] She began her final voyage on 5 October 1987, together with MV Gaelic, towed by the Dutch tug Markusturm.[33] The voyage was interrupted for four days when the ships encountered the Great Storm of 1987 off Cape Finisterre, where Herald of Free Enterprise was cast adrift after its tow rope parted,[34] resuming on 19 October 1987. The hulk began to disintegrate while off the coast of South Africa on 27 December 1987, and had to be towed into Port Elizabeth on 2 January 1988 to undergo temporary repairs to allow her to continue her voyage. She finally arrived in Taiwan on 22 March 1988.[35]\\r\\nOwing to the incident, the Townsend Thoresen name had inevitably been broadcast on television and in newspapers around the world. P&O quickly decided to rebrand the company as P&O European Ferries, repaint their fleet's red hulls in navy blue and remove the TT logo from the funnels.[36]\\r\\nThe sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise caused the highest death-count of any peacetime maritime disaster involving a British ship since the sinking of HMY Iolaire on 1 January 1919 near Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, where at least 205 perished of the 280 aboard.[37]\\r\\nSince the accident several improvements to the design of this type of vessel have been made. These include indicators that display the state of the bow doors on the bridge, watertight ramps being fitted to the bow sections of the front of the ship, and \\"freeing flaps\\" to allow water to escape from a vehicle deck in the event of flooding. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea regulations were changed in 1990 to require 125 centimetres (49?in) of freeboard (in the case of RORO vessels, defined as the height between the vehicle deck and the water line) for all new ROROs, instead of the previous 76 centimetres (30?in).[18] Some vessels omit the bow door configuration altogether and vehicles enter and exit from rear doors only. New International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations are in place that prohibit an open (undivided) deck of this length on a passenger RORO vessel.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe divers and rescuers who entered the capsized vessel to retrieve corpses received psychosocial support designed and delivered by Belgian Army psychologist Luc Quintyn. This was the first step to the establishment of a Crisis Psychology Unit within the Belgian Army Hospital.\\r\\nNeither of Herald of Free Enterprise's two sister ships are still operational; the former Spirit of Free Enterprise was extended to increase her cargo capacity during her time under the P&O flag in a stretch and total rebuild operation and scrapped in 2012. Pride of Free Enterprise was still more or less as built; she was scrapped in 2015.[38]\\r\\nA few scenes of the disaster videotaped live by the media were used by film director Krzysztof Kie?lowski as part of the conclusion of his film Three Colours: Red that bound together the Three Colours trilogy.\\r\\nIn Britain, a group named Ferry Aid released a charity record of the song \\"Let It Be\\" by The Beatles.\\r\\nNicholas Ridley, a government minister at the time, was criticised for alluding to the accident (while speaking on another subject) on 10 March 1987. He was quoted as saying that \\"although he is the pilot of the [parliamentary] Bill, he has not got his bow doors open\\". He apologised for the remark.[39]\\r\\nIn 2007 Belgian singer Jonathan Vandenbroeck, more commonly known as Milow, released a song to mark the 20th anniversary of the tragedy. Titled \\"Herald of Free Enterprise\\", the song echoes the tragic events of the evening and was featured on his 2009 album Milow.\\r\\nThe disaster was the subject of an episode from Series 2 of Seconds From Disaster.\\r\\nOn 1 July 2014, The History Press released a book called Ninety Seconds At Zeebrugge: The Herald of Free Enterprise Story, telling the story of the disaster and its aftermath.\\r\\nSt Mary's Church, Dover houses a permanent memorial to the disaster.[40]\\r\\nAustralian businessman Maurice de Rohan, who lost his daughter and son-in-law in the tragedy, founded Disaster Action, a charity which assists people affected by similar events.[41]\\r\\nThe following British awards for gallantry on the night of the sinking were gazetted on 30 December 1987:[42]\\r\\nCoordinates: 512228.5N 31126E? / ?51.374583N 3.19056E? / 51.374583; 3.19056[43]\\r\\nFate of the three sister ships:\\r\\nCitations\\r\\nSources","input":"When did the herald of free enterprise sink?"},{"output":"Mystery Incorporated","context":"","input":"What is the name of scooby doos gang?"},{"output":"at least one","context":"A limited partnership (LP) is a form of partnership similar to a general partnership except that while a general partnership must have at least two general partners (GPs), a limited partnership must have at least one GP and at least one limited partner.[1]\\r\\nThe GPs are, in all major respects, in the same legal position as partners in a conventional firm: they have management control, share the right to use partnership property, share the profits of the firm in predefined proportions, and have joint and several liability for the debts of the partnership.\\r\\nAs in a general partnership, the GPs have actual authority, as agents of the firm, to bind the partnership in contracts with third parties that are in the ordinary course of the partnership's business. As with a general partnership, \\"an act of a general partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the limited partnership's activities or activities of the kind carried on by the limited partnership binds the limited partnership only if the act was actually authorized by all the other partners.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike shareholders in a corporation, limited partners have limited liability. This means that the limited partners have no management authority, and (unless they obligate themselves by a separate contract such as a guarantee) are not liable for the debts of the partnership. The limited partnership provides the limited partners a return on their investment (similar to a dividend), the nature and extent of which is usually defined in the partnership agreement. General Partners thus bear more economic risk than do limited partners, and in cases of financial loss, the GPs will be the ones which are personally liable.\\r\\nLimited partners are subject to the same alter-ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the limited partnership veil because limited partnerships do not have many formalities to maintain. So long as the partnership and the members do not co-mingle funds, it would be difficult to pierce the veil.[3]\\r\\nPartnership interests (including the interests of limited partners) are afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtors share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen the partnership is being constituted, or the composition of the firm is changing, limited partnerships are generally required to file documents with the relevant state registration office. Limited partners must explicitly disclose their status when dealing with other parties, so that such parties are on notice that the individual negotiating with them carries limited liability. It is customary that the documentation and electronic materials issued to the public by the firm will carry a clear statement identifying the legal nature of the firm and listing the partners separately as general and limited. Hence, unlike the GPs, the limited partners do not have inherent agency authority to bind the firm unless they are subsequently held out as agents (and so create an agency by estoppel); or acts of ratification by the firm create ostensible authority.\\r\\nLimited partnerships are distinct from limited liability partnerships, in which all partners have limited liability. In some jurisdictions, the limited liability of the limited partners is contingent on their not participating in management.\\r\\nThe societates publicanorum, which arose in Rome in the third century BC, may have arguably been the earliest form of limited partnership. During the heyday of the Roman Empire, they were roughly equivalent to today's corporations. Some had many investors, and interests were publicly tradable. However, they required at least one (and often several) partners with unlimited liability.[4]\\r\\nAccording to Jairus Banaji, the Qirad and Mudaraba institutions in Islamic law and economic jurisprudence were similar to the modern limited partnership. In medieval Italy, a business organization known as the commenda appeared in the 10th century that was generally used for financing maritime trade. In a commenda, the traveling trader of the ship had limited liability, and was not held responsible if money was lost as long as the trader had not violated the rules of the contract. In contrast, his investment partners on land had unlimited liability and were exposed to risk. A commenda was not a common form for a long-term business venture as most long-term businesses were still expected to be secured against the assets of their individual proprietors.[5] As an institution, the commenda is very similar to the qirad but whether the qirad transformed into the commenda, or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.[6]\\r\\nColbert's Ordinance (1673) and the Napoleonic Code (1807) reinforced the limited partnership concept in European law. In the United States, limited partnerships became widely available in the early 19th century, although a number of legal restrictions at the time made them unpopular for business ventures. Britain enacted its first limited partnership statute in 1907.[7]\\r\\nIn the United States, the limited partnership organization is most common among film production companies and real estate investment projects, or in types of businesses that focus on a single or limited-term project. They are also useful in \\"labor-capital\\" partnerships, where one or more financial backers prefer to contribute money or resources while the other partner performs the actual work. In such situations, liability is the driving concern behind the choice of limited partnership status. The limited partnership is also attractive to firms wishing to provide shares to many individuals without the additional tax liability of a corporation. Private equity companies almost exclusively use a combination of general and limited partners for their investment funds. Well-known limited partnerships include Enterprise Products and Blackstone Group (both of which are public companies), and Bloomberg L.P. (a private company).\\r\\nBefore 2001, the limited liability enjoyed by limited partners was contingent upon their refraining from taking any active role in the management of the firm. However, Section 303 of the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (if adopted by a state legislature) eliminates the so-called \\"control rule\\" with respect to personal liability for entity obligations and brings limited partners into parity with LLC members, LLP partners and corporate shareholders.\\r\\nThe 2001 amendments to the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (to the extent the amendments are adopted by state legislature) also permitted limited partnerships to become Limited Liability Limited Partnerships in states that adopt the change. Under this form, debts of a limited liability limited partnership are solely the responsibility of the partnership, thereby removing general-partner liability for partnership obligations. This change was made in response to the common practice of naming a limited-liability entity as a 1% general partner that controlled the limited partnership and organizing the managers as limited partners. This practice granted a general partner de facto limited liability under the partnership structure.[8]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, limited partnerships are governed by the Limited Partnerships Act 1907. The UK Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (now the Department for Business Innovation and Skills) consulted in 2008 on proposals to modify and merge the Act with the Partnership Act 1890,[9] but the proposals did not go ahead, and the 1907 Act remains the governing Act.\\r\\nEnglish law and Scottish law are distinct on partnerships. In English law, limited partnerships are not legally separate entities: the partners are jointly and severally liable and any lawsuits filed are filed against the partners by name. There has been discussion over whether limited partnerships operating under English law should be made separate legal entities in the same way as limited liability partnerships are. The Law Commission report on partnership law LC283 suggested that creation of separate legal personality should be left as an option for the partners to decide upon when a partnership is formed. There were concerns that automatically making partnerships separate legal entities would restrict their ability to trade in some European countries and also expose them to different tax regimes than expected.\\r\\nJapanese law has historically provided for two business forms similar to limited partnerships:\\r\\nIn 1999, the Diet of Japan passed legislation enabling the formation of \\"limited partnerships for investment\\" (œB?Ij??M, tshi jigy ygen sekinin kumiai). These are very similar to Anglo-American limited partnerships, in that they adopt most provisions of general partnership law but provide for limited liability for certain partners. Profits of an investment limited partnership pass through to all partners proportional to their investment share. For tax purposes, profits and losses will only pass through to the general partner(s) while the partnership has negative equity (i.e. liabilities exceeding assets); however, profits and losses while the partnership has positive equity are shared equally.\\r\\nIn New Zealand, Limited Partnerships are a form of partnership involving General Partners, (who are liable for all the debts and liabilities of the partnership) and Limited Partners (who are liable to the extent of their capital contribution to the partnership). The Limited Partnerships Act replaces Special Partnerships that exist under Part 2 of the Partnership Act 1908. Special partnerships are considered obsolete as they do not provide the appropriate structure preferred by foreign venture capital investors.\\r\\nFeatures of Limited Partnerships include:\\r\\nThe registers of Limited Partnerships and Overseas Limited Partnerships are administered by the New Zealand Companies Office. Registration, maintenance and annual return filing for Limited Partnerships and Overseas Limited Partnerships are conducted through manual forms.\\r\\nKommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien ÿ abbreviated KGaA ÿ is a German corporate designation standing for 'partnership limited by shares', a form of corporate organization roughly equivalent to a master limited partnership. A Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien has two types of participators. It has at least one partner with unlimited liability (Komplement?r). It is in that sense a private company. Komplement?rs are natural persons or legal persons. If the Komplement?r is a corporation with limited liability then the type of the company has to be named as UG (haftungsbeschr?nkt) & Co. KGaA, GmbH & Co. KGaA, AG & Co. KGaA or SE & Co. KGaA.[10] Under consideration of the aspects of European freedom of establishment it is also possible that corporations established under foreign law can become Komplement?rs of a KGaA forming companies like Limited & Co. KGaA.\\r\\nThe investment of the partners with limited liability (Kommanditisten) is the stock of the company (Grundkapital) and divided into shares. A KGaA is in that aspect comparable with a German Aktiengesellschaft.\\r\\nThe investment of all partners is the corporate's total capital (Gesamtkapital). The KGaA is a traditional type of very large family businesses (that are partly publicly traded) in Germany; the consumer products giant Henkel and pharmaceutical company Merck are prominent examples.[11] In case of Merck, besides the owning family Merck also the members of the executive board are fully and privately liable for the company (including a period after withdrawal). Also the German football club Borussia Dortmund uses this corporate organization for its professional football team.","input":"How many general partners in a limited partnership?"},{"output":"six working days","context":"The Brazilian passport is the official document for foreign travel issued by the federal government, through the Federal Police.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new model was officially introduced in July 2015 that complies with both Mercosul and ICAO standards, and bring a new biometric cryptography method, and replaces the last model, from 2010. The new passport also has a new due date of 10 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a rule, Brazilian passports are valid for ten years (five years, on 2010 model) from the date of issue. They cannot be renewed: a new passport must be obtained when the previous one has expired or a minimum validity period is required by the country to be visited.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrazilian passports can be ordered by mail at the Brazilian consulate that has jurisdiction over the person's residence in a foreign country. Passports ordered by mail are also valid for 10 years but do not possess a chip with the biometric data of its bearer.

For these countries, they may use just their domestic identification cards.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2014, the Federal Police Department extended the validity of the document, from five to ten years.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"passport\\" was first inserted into the Old Republic Constitution of Brazil in 1891, which defined that anyone of any nationality could enter and leave the country during peacetime.[4] However, there are records of travel documents being checked at Brazilian ports of entry from as early as 1530, and during the 19th century wave of immigration to Brazil, passports from overseas were checked as well.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newest model for Brazilian passports, introduced in December 2006, follows the standard established by the Mercosul countries concerning cover color (dark blue for common passports) and the printing of the name Mercosul (Portuguese) or Mercosur (Spanish) on the upper portion of the cover, with the country name below it. The new passport model was first issued to Brazilian citizens for travel outside the country in 2007 and by May 2010 was the sole model being issued.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous, \\"old\\" model has a dark-green cover and is not machine-readable. It does not have the name Mercosul printed on its cover, either. The even older model (also green) that was used until the 1970s, following that time's diplomatic tradition, had the inside pages printed only in Portuguese and French; the more recent \\"green\\" model has text in Portuguese, French and English. The latest, \\"blue\\" model is in four languages: Portuguese, French, English and Spanish, but the page with the holder's identification data is in Portuguese and English only, and the cover only in Portuguese.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder passports (the \\"green\\" model) were produced either by Casa da Moeda do Brasil, the government's official mint, or by the American Bank Note Company. New passports (the \\"blue\\" model) are made solely by Casa da Moeda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Brazilian passport is machine-readable, complying with the ICAO Document 9303 standard. When the passport is first issued, the holder's fingerprints, signature and photograph are digitally acquired and stored in a database, but only the holder's digital picture is coded in the physical passport, in a two-dimensional barcode. The latter, as well as the holder's personal identification data and his or her picture are directly laser-printed on the passport; only the holder's signature is handwritten in the traditional way. (Since the old \\"green\\" model was designed in the 1970s, before computer technology became widely available, the holder's data are typewritten or even handwritten on it.) At 8.5?x?12.5?cm (3.35?x?5.31?inches), the new passport model is 1?cm (0.39?inch) shorter in height than its predecessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassports issued before November 2010 do not contain an RFID chip, but do contain about 20 advanced security features, including a security band embedded within the paper pulp, sewing threads and watermarks with a red fluorescence under ultraviolet light, latent images, optically-variable ink, laser perforations and a holographic plastic film protecting the holder's data page.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2010, the Brazilian passport began being issued with an RFID chip.

The message identifies the bearer as a citizen of the issuing country, requests free passage through the other country, and requests further that, when necessary, aid and protection be afforded as per international laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Brazilian passports, there is no highlight to the message whatsoever, nor is it referred to as a message from Brazilian authorities. It is printed on the back of the front cover, as well as three other information blocks. It is in Portuguese, French, English and Spanish.

One fills the necessary information in an on-line form and must print the application form and the bank document for paying the required fee. If the new-model passport is going to be issued (the site will inform if it is available at the chosen city and post), an appointment must be previously scheduled; this is also done on-line.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the scheduled time (or at any time during the passport issuing post's working hours, for the old model), the applicant goes to the chosen Federal Police post with the required documents (no photograph needed for the new model, since the photo is taken digitally on the spot) and the passport will be ready at most six working days later (usually less). There is no fast-track system under ordinary circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe applicant's physical presence at the post is required for both applying for and picking up the passport, even if the old-model version will be issued. Special cases where the applicant is unable to go in person for relevant reasons (such as health issues) must be arranged with the authorities on a case-by-case basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of July 2015, the passport issuing fee is R$257.00. Passports issued from May 2010 up to June 2015, the issuing fee was R$156.07 (BRL) and R$89.71 for the oldest model (pre 2010). The fee can be paid at any Brazilian bank, including Internet and home banking, with a document that is issued during the on-line application process and can be printed for payment.

It is by far the most common hummingbird seen east of the Mississippi River in North America.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis hummingbird is from 7 to 9?cm (2.8 to 3.5?in) long and has an 8 to 11?cm (3.1 to 4.3?in) wingspan. Weight can range from 2 to 6?g (0.071 to 0.212?oz), with males averaging 3.4?g (0.12?oz) against the slightly larger female which averages 3.8?g (0.13?oz).[2][3] Adults are metallic green above and greyish white below, with near-black wings. Their bill, at up to 2?cm (0.79?in), is long, straight, and very slender. As in all hummingbirds, the toes and feet of this species are quite small, with a middle toe of around 0.6?cm (0.24?in) and a tarsus of approximately 0.4?cm (0.16?in). The ruby-throated hummingbird can only shuffle if it wants to move along a branch, though it can scratch its head and neck with its feet.[4][5]\\r\\nThe species is sexually dimorphic.[6] The adult male has a gorget (throat patch) of iridescent ruby red bordered narrowly with velvety black on the upper margin and a forked black tail with a faint violet sheen. The red iridescence is highly directional and appears dull black from many angles. The female has a notched tail with outer feathers banded in green, black, and white and a white throat that may be plain or lightly marked with dusky streaks or stipples. Males are smaller than females and have slightly shorter bills. Juvenile males resemble adult females, though usually with heavier throat markings.[7] The plumage is molted once a year, beginning in late summer.\\r\\nThe breeding habitat is throughout most of eastern North America and the Canadian prairies, in deciduous and pine forests and forest edges, orchards, and gardens. The female builds a nest in a protected location in a shrub or a tree. Of all hummingbirds in the United States, this species has the largest breeding range.[4]\\r\\nThe ruby-throated hummingbird is migratory, spending most of the winter in southern Mexico and Central America,[8] as far south as extreme western Panama,[9] the West Indies, and southern Florida. During migration, some birds embark on a nonstop 900-mile journey across the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean from Panama to Gulf Coast.[8] The bird breeds throughout the eastern United States, east of the 100th meridian, and in southern Canada, particularly Ontario, in eastern and mixed deciduous and broadleaved forest.[10][11] In winter, it is seen mostly in Mexico and southern Florida.\\r\\nDuring migration southward in autumn along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, older male and female birds were better prepared for long-distance flight than first-year birds by having higher body weights and larger fuel loads.[12]\\r\\nRuby-throated hummingbirds are solitary. Adults of this species are not social, other than during courtship (which lasts a few minutes); the female also cares for her offspring. Both males and females of any age are aggressive toward other hummingbirds. They may defend territories, such as a feeding territory, attacking and chasing other hummingbirds that enter.\\r\\nAs part of their spring migration, portions of the population fly from the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico across the Gulf of Mexico, arriving first in Florida and Louisiana.[8] This feat is impressive, as a 800?km (500?mi), non-stop flight over water would seemingly require a caloric energy that far exceeds an adult hummingbird's body weight of 3?g (0.11?oz).[8] However, researchers discovered the tiny birds can double their fat mass in preparation for their Gulf crossing[13], then expend the entire calorie reserve from fat during the 20-hour non-stop crossing when food and water are unavailable.[8][14]\\r\\nHummingbirds have one of the highest metabolic rates of any animal, with heart rates up to 1260 beats per minute, breathing rate of about 250 breaths per minute even at rest, and oxygen consumption of about 4 ml oxygen/g/hour at rest.[15] During flight, hummingbird oxygen consumption per gram of muscle tissue is approximately 10 times higher than that seen for elite human athletes.[8]\\r\\nThey feed frequently while active during the day. When temperatures drop, particularly on cold nights, they may conserve energy by entering hypothermic torpor.[8]\\r\\nHummingbirds have many skeletal and flight muscle adaptations which allow great agility in flight. Muscles make up 25ÿ30% of their body weight, and they have long, blade-like wings that, unlike the wings of other birds, connect to the body only from the shoulder joint.[16] This adaptation allows the wing to rotate almost 180, enabling the bird to fly not only forward but backward, and to hover in mid-air, flight capabilities that are similar to insects and unique among birds.[16]\\r\\nAnalysis of the main wing bone, the humerus, is thought to be specifically adapted for hovering flight. Hummingbirds have a relatively short humerus with proportionally massive deltoid-pectoral muscles which permit pronounced wing supination during upstroke when hovering.[17]\\r\\nA hummingbird's ability to hover is due to its small mass, high wingbeat frequency and relatively large margin of mass-specific power available for flight. Several anatomical features contribute further, including proportionally massive major flight muscles (pectoralis major and supracoracoideus) and wing anatomy that enables the bird to leave its wings extended yet turned over (supine) during the upstroke. This generates lift that supports body weight and maneuvering.[18]\\r\\nHummingbirds achieve ability to support their weight and hover from wing beats creating lift on the downstroke of a wing flap and also on the upstroke in a ratio of 75%:25%, respectively, similarly to an insect.[18][19] Hummingbirds and insects gain lift during hovering partially through inversion of their cambered wings during an upstroke.[19] During hovering, hummingbird wings beat up to 80 times per second.[20]\\r\\nNectar from flowers and flowering trees, as well as small insects and spiders, are its main food. Although hummingbirds are well known to feed on nectar, small arthropods are an important source part of protein, minerals, and vitamins in the diet of adult hummingbirds. Hummingbirds show a slight preference for red, orange, and bright pink tubular flowers as nectar sources, though flowers not adapted to hummingbird pollination (e.g., willow catkins) are also visited.[9] Their diet may also occasionally include sugar-rich tree sap taken from sapsucker wells. The birds feed from flowers using a long, extendable tongue and catch insects on the wing or glean them from flowers, leaves, bark, and spiders' webs.\\r\\nYoung birds are fed insects for protein since nectar is an insufficient source of protein for the growing birds.[9]\\r\\nAs typical for their family, ruby-throated hummingbirds are thought to be polygynous. Polyandry and polygynandry may also occur. They do not form breeding pairs, with males departing immediately after the reproductive act and females providing all parental care.[21]\\r\\nMales arrive at the breeding area in the spring and establish a territory before the females arrive. When the females return, males court females that enter their territory by performing courtship displays. They perform a \\"dive display\\" rising 2.45ÿ3.1?m (8.0ÿ10.2?ft) above and 1.52ÿ1.82?m (5.0ÿ6.0?ft) to each side of the female. If the female perches, the male begins flying in very rapid horizontal arcs less than 0.5?m (1.6?ft) in front of her. If the female is receptive to the male, she may give a call and assume a solicitous posture with her tail feathers cocked and her wings drooped.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe nest is usually constructed on a small, downward-sloping tree limb 3.1 to 12.2?m (10 to 40?ft) feet above the ground. Favored trees are usually deciduous, such as oak, hornbeam, birch, poplar or hackberry, although pines have also been used. Nests have even been found on loops of chain, wire, and extension cords.[4] The nest is composed of bud scales, with lichen on the exterior, bound with spider's silk, and lined with fibers such as plant down (often dandelion or thistle down) and animal hair. Most nests are well camouflaged. Old nests may be occupied for several seasons, but are repaired annually.[9] As in all known hummingbird species, the female alone constructs the nest and cares for the eggs and young.\\r\\nFemales lay two (with a range of 1 to 3) white eggs about 12.9?mm G?8.5?mm (0.51?in G?0.33?in) in size and produce one to two broods each summer.[4] They brood the chicks over a period of 12 to 14 days, by which point they are feathered and homeothermic. The female feeds the chicks from 1 to 3 times every hour by regurgitation, usually while the female continues hovering. When they are 18 to 22 days old, the young leave the nest and make their first flight.[9]\\r\\nThe oldest known ruby-throated hummingbird to be banded was 9 years and 1 month of age. Almost all hummingbirds of 7 years or more in age are females, with males rarely surviving past 5 years of age. Reasons for higher mortality in males may include loss of weight during the breeding season due to the high energetic demands of defending a territory followed by energetically costly migration.[8]\\r\\nA variety of animals prey on hummingbirds given the opportunity. Due to their small size, hummingbirds are vulnerable even to passerine birds and other animals which generally feed on insects. On the other hand, only very swift predators can capture them and a free-flying adult hummingbird is too nimble for most predators. Chief among their predators are the smaller, swifter raptors like sharp-shinned hawks, merlins, American kestrels and Mississippi kites as well as domestic cats, loggerhead shrikes and even greater roadrunners, all of which are likely to ambush the hummingbird while it sits or sleeps on a perch or are distracted by breeding or foraging activities. Predatory lizards and bird-eating snakes may also prey on the species, especially on its tropical wintering grounds. Even large, predatory invertebrates have preyed on ruby-throated hummingbirds, including praying mantises (which have been seen to ambush adult hummingbirds at hummingbird feeders on more than one occasion), orb-weaver spiders, and green Darners. Blue jays are common predators of nests, as are several other corvids in addition to some icterids, bats, squirrels and chipmunks.[22][23][24][25]\\r\\nThe vocalizations of ruby-throated hummingbirds are rapid, squeaky chirps, which are used primarily for threats. For example, males may vocalize to warn another male that has entered his territory.\\r\\nDuring the courtship displays, the male makes a rapid tik-tik tik-tik tik-tik sound with his wings.[26] The sound is produced both during the shuttle display, at each end of the side-to-side flight. Also, the sound is made during dive displays. A second, rather faint, repeated whining sound is sometimes produced with the outer tail-feathers during the dive, as the male flies over the female, spreading and shutting the tail as he does so.\\r\\nMale ruby-throated hummingbird guarding his territory from the top of a tomato stake\\r\\nBrooklyn Museum - Ruby-throated Humming Bird - John J.

The rand is subdivided into 100 cents (sign: \\"c\\"). The ISO 4217 code is ZAR, from Dutch Zuid-Afrikaanse Rand (South African rand). The rand is legal tender in the Common Monetary Area between South Africa, Swaziland, Lesotho, and Namibia, although the latter three countries do have their own currencies.\\r\\nHistorical users of the South African rand included South West Africa and the nominally independent Bantustans under the apartheid system: Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei and Venda.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rand takes its name from the Witwatersrand (literally \\"white waters' ridge\\" in English), the ridge upon which Johannesburg is built and where most of South Africa's gold deposits were found.\\r\\nThe rand was introduced in the then Union of South Africa on 14 February 1961, three months before the Republic of South Africa was established.[1] A Decimal Coinage Commission had been set up in 1956 to consider a move away from the denominations of pounds, shillings, and pence, submitting its recommendation on 8 August 1958.[2] It replaced the South African pound as legal tender, at the rate of 2 rand to 1 pound, or 10 shillings to the rand. The government introduced a mascot, Decimal Dan, \\"the rand-cent man\\" (known in Afrikaans as Dan Desimaal).[3] This was accompanied by a radio jingle, to inform the public about the new currency.[4]\\r\\nA rand was worth US$1.40 from the time of its inception in 1961 until late in 1971. Its value thereafter fluctuated as various exchange rate dispensations were implemented by the South African authorities. By the early 1980s high inflation and mounting political pressure combined with sanctions placed against the country due to apartheid started to erode its value. The currency broke above parity with the dollar for the first time in March 1982, and continued to trade between R?1 and R?1.30 to the dollar until June 1984, when depreciation of the currency gained momentum. By February 1985, it was trading over R?2 per dollar, and in July that year, all foreign exchange trading was suspended for three days to try to stop the depreciation.\\r\\nBy the time that State President P. W. Botha made his Rubicon speech on 15 August 1985, it had weakened to R?2.40 per dollar. The currency recovered somewhat between 1986ÿ88, trading near the R?2 level most of the time and even breaking beneath it sporadically. The recovery was short-lived, however, and by the end of 1989, the rand was trading at levels more than R?2.50 per dollar.\\r\\nAs it became clear in the early 1990s that the country was destined for black majority rule and one reform after the other was announced, uncertainty about the future of the country hastened the depreciation until the level of R 3 to the dollar was breached in November 1992. A host of local and international events influenced the currency after that, most notably the 1994 democratic election which had it weaken to over R?3.60 to the dollar, the election of Tito Mboweni as the new governor of the South African Reserve Bank, and the inauguration of President Thabo Mbeki in 1999 which had it quickly slide to over R?6 to the dollar. The controversial land reform program that was kicked off in Zimbabwe, followed by the September 11, 2001 attacks, propelled it to its weakest historical level of R?13.84 to the dollar in December 2001.\\r\\nThis sudden depreciation in 2001 led to a formal investigation, which in turn led to a dramatic recovery. By the end of 2002, the currency was trading under R?9 to the dollar again, and by the end of 2004 was trading under R?5.70 to the dollar. The currency softened somewhat in 2005, and was trading around R?6.35 to the dollar at the end of the year. At the start of 2006, however, the currency resumed its rally, and as of 19 January 2006, was trading under R 6 to the dollar again. However, during the second and third quarters of 2006 (i.e. April through September), the rand weakened significantly.\\r\\nIn sterling terms, it fell from around 9.5p to just over 7p, losing some 25% of its international trade-weighted value in just six months. Late in 2007, the rand rallied modestly to just over 8p, only to experience a precipitous slide during the first quarter of 2008.\\r\\nThis downward slide could be attributed to a range of factors: South Africa's worsening current account deficit, which widened to a 36?year high of 7.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007; inflation at a five-year high of just under 9%; escalating global risk aversion as investors' concerns over the spreading impact of the subprime crisis grew; and a general flight to \\"safe havens\\", away from the perceived risks of emerging markets. The rand depreciation was exacerbated by the Eskom electricity crisis, which arose from the utility being unable to meet the country's rapidly growing energy demands.\\r\\nA stalled mining industry in late 2012 led to new lows in early 2013.[6] In late January 2014, the rand slid to R11.25 to the dollar, with analysts attributing the shift to \\"word from the US Federal Reserve that it would trim back stimulus spending, which led to a massive sell-off in emerging economies.\\"[7] In 2014 South Africa experienced its worst year against the US dollar since 2009,[8] and in March 2015, the rand traded at its worst since 2002.[8] At the time, Trading Economics released data that the rand \\"averaged R4.97 to the dollar between 1972 and 2015, reaching an all time high of R12.45 in December of 2001 and a record low of R0.67 in June of 1973.\\"[8] By the end of 2014, the rand had weakened to R?15.05 per dollar, partly due to South Africa's consistent trade account deficit with the rest of the world.\\r\\nFrom 9 December 2015 to 13 December 2015, over a four-day period, the rand dropped over 10% due to what some suspected was President Zuma's surprise announcement that he would be replacing the then-Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene with the little-known David van Rooyen. The rapid drop in value was stemmed when the President back-tracked and announced that the better-known previous Minister of Finance, Pravin Gordhan, would instead be appointed to the post. Zuma's surprise firing of Nene damaged international confidence in the rand, with it experiencing significant exchange volatility throughout much of January 2016, reaching an all-time low of R?17.9169 to the US dollar on the 9 January 2016 before rebounding to R?16.57 later the same day.[9]\\r\\nThe January drop in value was also partly caused by Japanese retail investors cutting their losses in the currency to look for higher-yield investments elsewhere and due to concerns over the impact of the economic slowdown in China, South Africa's largest export partner.[10] By mid-January, economists were speculating that the rand could expect to see further volatility for the rest of 2016.[11][12] By 29 April, it reached its highest performance over the previous 5 months, exchanging at a rate of 14.16 to the United States dollar [13]\\r\\nFollowing the United Kingdom's (UK) vote to leave the European Union (EU), the rand dropped in value over 8% against the United States dollar on the 24th June 2016, the currency's largest single-day decline since the 2008 crash.[14] This was partly due to a general global financial retreat from currencies seen as risky to the US dollar[15] and partly due to concerns over how the UK's withdrawal from the EU would impact South Africa's economy and trade relations.[14][16]\\r\\nIn April 2017, a Reuters poll estimated that the rand would remain relatively stable for the rest of the year, as two polls found that analysts had already factored in a possible downgrade to \\"junk\\" status. At the time, Moody's graded South Africa two notches above junk status.[17] When president Jacob Zuma narrowly won a motion of no-confidence in South Africa in August 2017, the rand continued to slide, dropping 1.7 percent that day.[18] In September 2017, Goldman Sachs Group said that the debt and corruption of Eskom Holdings was the biggest risk to South Africa's economy and exchange rate of the rand. At the time it had no permanent CEO, and Colin Coleman of Goldman Sachs in Africa said the company was \\"having discussions on solutions\\" on finding credible management.[19] In October 2017, the rand firmed against the US dollar as it recovered from a six-month low. Reuters noted that \\"South Africa is highly susceptible to global investor sentiment as the country relies on foreign money to cover its large budget and current account deficits.\\"[20] On November 13, 2017, the rand \\"tumbled\\" over a full percent when the budget chief Michael Sachs stood down from his position in Zuma's administration.[21]\\r\\nCoins were introduced in 1961 in denominations of ?1?2, 1, ?2?1?2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents. In 1965, 2-cent coins replaced the ?2?1?2-cent coins. The ?1?2-cent coin was last struck for circulation in 1973. The 2-rand coin was introduced in 1989, followed by 5-rand coins in 1994. Production of the 1- and 2-cent coins was discontinued in 2002, primarily due to inflation having devalued them, but they remain legal tender.[22][23][24] Shops normally round the total purchase price of goods to the nearest 10 cents (in favour of the consumer).\\r\\nIn an effort to curb counterfeiting, a new 5-rand coin was released in August 2004. Security features introduced on the coin include a bimetal design (similar to the ?1 and ?2 coins, the Thai 10-baht coin, the British S2 coin, and the Canadian $2 coin), a specially serrated security groove along the rim and microlettering.[25]\\r\\nThe first series of rand banknotes was introduced in 1961 in denominations of 1, 2, 10, and 20 rand, with similar designs and colours to the preceding pound notes to ease the transition. They bore the image of what was believed at the time to be Jan van Riebeeck, the first V.O.C. administrator of Cape Town. It was later discovered that the image was not in fact Van Riebeeck at all.[26] Like the last pound notes, they were printed in two variants, one with English written first and the other with Afrikaans written first. This practice was continued in the 1966 series which included the first 5-rand notes, but did not include the 20-rand denomination.\\r\\nThe 1978 series began with denominations of 2, 5, and 10 rand, with 20 and 50 rand introduced in 1984. This series had a major design change. In addition, the series has only one variant for each denomination of note. Afrikaans was the first language on the 2, 10, and 50 rand, while English was the first language on 5 and 20 rand. The notes bore the image of Jan van Riebeeck. The 1-rand note was replaced by a coin.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the notes were redesigned with images of the Big Five wildlife species; 10-, 20- and 50-rand notes were introduced in 1992, retaining the colour scheme of the previous issue. Coins were introduced for 2 rand and 5 rand, replacing the notes of the previous series, mainly because of the severe wear and tear experienced with low-denomination notes in circulation. In 1994, notes were introduced for 100 and 200 rand.\\r\\nThe 2005 series has the same principal design, but with additional security features such as colour-shifting ink on the 50-rand and higher and the EURion constellation. The obverses of all denominations are printed in English, while two other languages are printed on the reverses, thus making use of all 11 official languages of South Africa.\\r\\nIn 2010, the South African Reserve Bank and commercial banks withdrew all 1994 series R 200 banknotes due to relatively high-quality counterfeit notes in circulation.[27]\\r\\nIn 2011, the South African Reserve Bank issued 100-rand banknotes which were defective because they lacked fluorescent printing visible under UV light. In June, printing of this denomination was moved from the South African Bank Note Company to Crane Currencys Swedish division (Tumba Bruk), which reportedly produced 80 million 100-rand notes.[28] The South African Reserve Bank shredded 3.6 million 100-rand banknotes printed by Crane Currency because they had the same serial numbers as a batch printed by the South African Bank Note Company. In addition, the notes printed in Sweden were not the correct colour, and they were 1 mm short.[29]\\r\\nOn 11 February 2012, President Jacob Zuma announced that the country would be issuing a complete set of banknotes bearing Nelson Mandela's image.[30][31] They were entered into circulation on 6 November 2012.[32]\\r\\nIn 2013, the 2012 series was updated with the addition of the EURion constellation to all five notes.[33]","input":"What kind of money does south africa use?"},{"output":"on March 29, 1994","context":"Internet in the Philippines first became available on March 29, 1994, with the Philippine Network Foundation (PHNet) connecting the country and its people to Sprint in the United States via a 64 kbit/s link.[1][2][3]\\r\\nAs of 2016, more than 44,000,000 people used the internet in the country, accounting for 43.5% of the total population.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nA year after the connection, The Public Telecommunications Act of the Philippines was made into law.

Ұץ; post-reform Russian: 񳭷?  Ұ, translit.?Voyn i mir [v?j?na i ?m?ir]) is a novel by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy, which is regarded as a central work of world literature and one of Tolstoy's finest literary achievements.[1][2][3]\\r\\nThe novel chronicles the history of the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families. Portions of an earlier version, titled The Year 1805,[4] were serialized in The Russian Messenger from 1865 to 1867. The novel was first published in its entirety in 1869.[5]\\r\\nTolstoy said War and Peace is \\"not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle\\". Large sections, especially the later chapters, are a philosophical discussion rather than narrative.[6] Tolstoy also said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call War and Peace a novel. Instead, he regarded Anna Karenina as his first true novel. The Encyclop?dia Britannica states: \\"It can be argued that no single English novel attains the universality of the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace\\".[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWar and Peace is perhaps best known as one of the longest novels ever written.[8] and its title is often used idiomatically to represent any allegedly excessively long piece of writing.[9]\\r\\nTolstoy began writing War and Peace in 1862, the year that he finally married and settled down at his country estate. The first half of the book was written under the name \\"1805\\". During the writing of the second half, he read widely and acknowledged Schopenhauer as one of his main inspirations. However, Tolstoy developed his own views of history and the role of the individual within it.[10]\\r\\nThe first draft of the novel was completed in 1863. In 1865, the periodical Russkiy Vestnik (The Russian Messenger) published the first part of this draft under the title 1805 and published more the following year. Tolstoy was dissatisfied with this version, although he allowed several parts of it to be published with a different ending in 1867. He heavily rewrote the entire novel between 1866 and 1869.[5][10] Tolstoy's wife, Sophia Tolstaya, copied as many as seven separate complete manuscripts before Tolstoy considered it again ready for publication.[10] The version that was published in Russkiy Vestnik had a very different ending from the version eventually published under the title War and Peace in 1869. Russians who had read the serialized version were anxious to buy the complete novel, and it sold out almost immediately. The novel was translated almost immediately after publication into many other languages.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is unknown why Tolstoy changed the name to War and Peace. He may have borrowed the title from the 1861 work of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: La Guerre et la Paix (\\"The War and the Peace\\" in French).[4] The title may also be another reference to Titus, described as being a master of \\"war and peace\\" in The Twelve Caesars, written by Suetonius in 119 CE. The completed novel was then called Voyna i mir (񳭷  Ұ in new-style orthography; in English War and Peace).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 1805 manuscript was re-edited and annotated in Russia in 1983 and since has been translated into English, German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Albanian, Korean, and Czech.\\r\\nTolstoy was instrumental in bringing a new kind of consciousness to the novel. His narrative structure is noted for its \\"god-like\\" ability to hover over and within events, but also in the way it swiftly and seamlessly portrayed a particular character's point of view. His use of visual detail is often cinematic in scope, using the literary equivalents of panning, wide shots and close-ups. These devices, while not exclusive to Tolstoy, are part of the new style of the novel that arose in the mid-19th century and of which Tolstoy proved himself a master.[11]\\r\\nThe standard Russian text of War and Peace is divided into four books (comprising fifteen parts) and an epilogue in two parts. Roughly the first half is concerned strictly with the fictional characters, whereas the latter parts, as well as the second part of the epilogue, increasingly consist of essays about the nature of war, power, history, and historiography. Tolstoy interspersed these essays into the story in a way that defies previous fictional convention. Certain abridged versions remove these essays entirely, while others, published even during Tolstoy's life, simply moved these essays into an appendix.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe novel is set 60 years before Tolstoy's day, but he had spoken with people who lived through the 1812 French invasion of Russia. He read all the standard histories available in Russian and French about the Napoleonic Wars and had read letters, journals, autobiographies and biographies of Napoleon and other key players of that era. There are approximately 160 real persons named or referred to in War and Peace.[12]\\r\\nHe worked from primary source materials (interviews and other documents), as well as from history books, philosophy texts and other historical novels.[10] Tolstoy also used a great deal of his own experience in the Crimean War to bring vivid detail and first-hand accounts of how the Russian army was structured.[13]\\r\\nTolstoy was critical of standard history, especially military history, in War and Peace. He explains at the start of the novel's third volume his own views on how history ought to be written. His aim was to blur the line between fiction and history, to get closer to the truth, as he states in Volume II.\\r\\nAlthough the book is mainly in Russian, significant portions of dialogue are in French. It has been suggested[14] that the use of French is a deliberate literary device, to portray artifice while Russian emerges as a language of sincerity, honesty, and seriousness. It could, however, also simply represent another element of the realistic style in which the book is written, since French was the common language of the Russian aristocracy at the time.[15] In fact, the Russian nobility often knew only enough Russian to command their servants; Tolstoy illustrates this by showing that Julie Karagina, a character in the novel, is so unfamiliar with her native tongue that she has to take Russian lessons.\\r\\nThe use of French diminishes as the book progresses. It is suggested that this is to demonstrate Russia freeing itself from foreign cultural domination,[14] and to show that a once-friendly nation has turned into an enemy. By midway through the book, several of the Russian aristocracy are anxious to find Russian tutors for themselves.\\r\\nThe novel spans the period 1805 to 1820. The era of Catherine the Great was still fresh in the minds of older people. Catherine had made French the language of her royal court.[16] For the next one hundred years, it became a social requirement for members of the Russian nobility to speak French and understand French culture.[16] This historical and cultural context in the aristocracy is reflected in War and Peace. Catherine's grandson, Alexander I, came to the throne in 1801 at the age of 24. In the novel, his mother, Marya Feodorovna, is the most powerful woman in the Russian court.\\r\\nThe novel tells the story of five familiesthe Bezukhovs, the Bolkonskys, the Rostovs, the Kuragins, and the Drubetskoys.\\r\\nThe main characters are:\\r\\nIn addition several real-life historical characters (such as Napoleon) and Prince Mikhail Kutuzov play a prominent part in the book. Many of Tolstoy's characters were based on real people. His grandparents and their friends were the models for many of the main characters; his great-grandparents would have been of the generation of Prince Vassily or Count Ilya Rostov.\\r\\nThe novel begins in July 1805 in Saint Petersburg, at a soire given by Anna Pavlovna Schererthe maid of honour and confidante to the dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna. Many of the main characters are introduced as they enter the salon. Pierre (Pyotr Kirilovich) Bezukhov is the illegitimate son of a wealthy count, who is dying after a series of strokes. Pierre is about to become embroiled in a struggle for his inheritance. Educated abroad at his father's expense following his mother's death, Pierre is kindhearted but socially awkward, and finds it difficult to integrate into Petersburg society. It is known to everyone at the soire that Pierre is his father's favorite of all the old counts illegitimate progeny.\\r\\nAlso attending the soire is Pierre's friend, Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, husband of Lise, a charming society favourite. He is disillusioned with Petersburg society and with married life, feeling that his wife is empty and superficial, and decides to escape to become aide-de-camp to Prince Mikhail Ilarionovich Kutuzov in the coming war against Napoleon.\\r\\nThe plot moves to Moscow, Russia's former capital, contrasting its provincial, more Russian ways to the more European society of Petersburg. The Rostov family are introduced. Count Ilya Andreyevich Rostov and Countess Natalya Rostova are an affectionate couple but forever worried about their disordered finances. They have four children. Thirteen-year-old Natasha (Natalia Ilyinichna) believes herself in love with Boris Drubetskoy, a young man who is about to join the army as an officer. Twenty-year-old Nikolai Ilyich pledges his love to Sonya (Sofia Alexandrovna), his fifteen-year-old cousin, an orphan who has been brought up by the Rostovs. The eldest child, Vera Ilyinichna, is cold and somewhat haughty but has a good prospective marriage in a Russian-German officer, Adolf Karlovich Berg. Petya (Pyotr Ilyich) at nine is the youngest; like his brother, he is impetuous and eager to join the army when of age.\\r\\nAt Bald Hills, the Bolkonskys' country estate, Prince Andrei departs for war and leaves his terrified, pregnant wife Lise with his eccentric father Prince Nikolai Andreyevich and devoutly religious sister Maria Nikolayevna Bolkonskaya, who refuses to marry the son of a wealthy aristocrat on account of her devotion to her father.\\r\\nThe second part opens with descriptions of the impending Russian-French war preparations. At the Sch?ngrabern engagement, Nikolai Rostov, now an ensign in the Hussars, has his first taste of battle. Boris Drubetskoy introduces him to Prince Andrei, whom Rostov insults in a fit of impetuousness. He is deeply attracted by Tsar Alexander's charisma. Nikolai gambles and socializes with his officer, Vasily Dmitrich Denisov, and befriends the ruthless, and perhaps, psychopathic Fyodor Ivanovich Dolokhov. Bolkonsky, Rostov and Denisov are involved in the disastrous Battle of Austerlitz, in which Prince Andrei is badly wounded as he attempts to rescue a Russian standard.\\r\\nThe Battle of Austerlitz is a major event in the book. As the battle is about to start, Prince Andrei thinks the approaching \\"day [will] be his Toulon, or his Arcola\\",[17] references to Napoleon's early victories. Later in the battle, however, Andrei falls into enemy hands and even meets his hero, Napoleon. But his previous enthusiasm has been shattered; he no longer thinks much of Napoleon, \\"so petty did his hero with his paltry vanity and delight in victory appear, compared to that lofty, righteous and kindly sky which he had seen and comprehended\\".[18] Tolstoy portrays Austerlitz as an early test for Russia, one which ended badly because the soldiers fought for irrelevant things like glory or renown rather than the higher virtues which would produce, according to Tolstoy, a victory at Borodino during the 1812 invasion.\\r\\nBook Two begins with Nikolai Rostov briefly returning on leave to Moscow accompanied by his friend Denisov, his officer from his Pavlograd Regiment. He spends an eventful winter at home. Natasha has blossomed into a beautiful young girl. Denisov falls in love with her, proposes marriage but is rejected. Although his mother pleads with Nikolai to marry a wealthy heiress to rescue the family from its dire financial straits, Nikolai refuses. Instead he promises to marry his childhood sweetheart and orphaned cousin, the dowry-less Sonya.\\r\\nPierre Bezukhov, upon finally receiving his massive inheritance, is suddenly transformed from a bumbling young man into the most eligible bachelor in the Russian Empire. Despite knowing that it is wrong, he is convinced into marriage with Prince Kuragin's beautiful and immoral daughter Hlne (Elena Vasilyevna Kuragina). Hlne, who is rumoured to be involved in an incestuous affair with her brother Anatol, tells Pierre that she will never have children with him. Hlne is also rumoured to have an affair with Dolokhov, who mocks Pierre in public. Pierre loses his temper and challenges Dolokhov to a duel. Unexpectedly (because Dolokhov is a seasoned dueller), Pierre wounds Dolokhov. Hlne denies her affair, but Pierre is convinced of her guilt and leaves her. In his moral and spiritual confusion, Pierre joins the Freemasons. Much of Book Two concerns his struggles with his passions and his spiritual conflicts. He abandons his former carefree behavior and enters upon a philosophical quest particular to Tolstoy: how should one live a moral life in an ethically imperfect world? The question continually baffles Pierre. He attempts to liberate his serfs, but ultimately achieves nothing of note.\\r\\nPierre is contrasted with Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. Andrei recovers from his near-fatal wound in a military hospital and returns home, only to find his wife Lise dying in childbirth. He is stricken by his guilty conscience for not treating her better. His child, Nikolai, survives.\\r\\nBurdened with nihilistic disillusionment, Prince Andrei does not return to the army but remains on his estate, working on a project that would codify military behavior to solve problems of disorganization responsible for the loss of life on the Russian side. Pierre visits him and brings new questions: where is God in this amoral world? Pierre is interested in panentheism and the possibility of an afterlife.\\r\\nPierre's wife, Hlne, begs him to take her back, and trying to abide by the Freemason laws of forgiveness, he agrees. Hlne establishes herself as an influential hostess in Petersburg society.\\r\\nPrince Andrei feels impelled to take his newly written military notions to Petersburg, naively expecting to influence either the Emperor himself or those close to him. Young Natasha, also in Petersburg, is caught up in the excitement of her first grand ball, where she meets Prince Andrei and briefly reinvigorates him with her vivacious charm. Andrei believes he has found purpose in life again and, after paying the Rostovs several visits, proposes marriage to Natasha. However, Andrei's father dislikes the Rostovs and opposes the marriage, and he insists the couple wait a year before marrying. Prince Andrei leaves to recuperate from his wounds abroad, leaving Natasha initially distraught. Count Rostov takes her and Sonya to Moscow in order to raise funds for her trousseau.\\r\\nNatasha visits the Moscow opera, where she meets Hlne and her brother Anatole. Anatole has since married a Polish woman whom he has abandoned in Poland. He is very attracted to Natasha and determined to seduce her, and conspires with his sister to do so. Anatole succeeds in making Natasha believe he loves her, eventually establishing plans to elope. Natasha writes to Princess Maria, Andrei's sister, breaking off her engagement. At the last moment, Sonya discovers her plans to elope and foils them. Natasha learns from Pierre of Anatole's marriage. Devastated, Natasha makes a suicide attempt and is left seriously ill.\\r\\nPierre is initially horrified by Natasha's behavior, but realizes he has fallen in love with her. As the Great Comet of 1811ÿ12 streaks the sky, life appears to begin anew for Pierre. Prince Andrei coldly accepts Natasha's breaking of the engagement. He tells Pierre that his pride will not allow him to renew his proposal.\\r\\nWith the help of her family, and the stirrings of religious faith, Natasha manages to persevere in Moscow through this dark period. Meanwhile, the whole of Russia is affected by the coming confrontation between Napoleon's troops and the Russian army. Pierre convinces himself through gematria that Napoleon is the Antichrist of the Book of Revelation. Old Prince Bolkonsky dies of a stroke knowing that French marauders are coming for his estate. No organized help from any Russian army seems available to the Bolkonskys, but Nikolai Rostov turns up at their estate in time to help put down an incipient peasant revolt. He finds himself attracted to the distraught Princess Maria.\\r\\nBack in Moscow, the patriotic Petya joins a crowd in audience of Czar Alexander and manages to snatch a biscuit thrown from the balcony window of the Cathedral of the Assumption by the Czar. He is nearly crushed by the throngs in his effort. Under the influence of the same patriotism, his father finally allows him to enlist.\\r\\nNapoleon himself is a main character in this section, and the novel presents him in vivid detail, both personally and as both a thinker and would-be strategist. Also described are the well-organized force of over 400,000 French Army (only 140,000 of them actually French-speaking) that marches through the Russian countryside in the late summer and reaches the outskirts of the city of Smolensk. Pierre decides to leave Moscow and go to watch the Battle of Borodino from a vantage point next to a Russian artillery crew. After watching for a time, he begins to join in carrying ammunition. In the midst of the turmoil he experiences first-hand the death and destruction of war; Eugne's artillery continues to pound Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout set up a crossfire with artillery positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. The battle becomes a hideous slaughter for both armies and ends in a standoff. The Russians, however, have won a moral victory by standing up to Napoleon's reputedly invincible army. The Russian army withdraws the next day, allowing Napoleon to march on to Moscow. Among the casualties are Anatole Kuragin and Prince Andrei. Anatole loses a leg, and Andrei suffers a grenade wound in the abdomen. Both are reported dead, but their families are in such disarray that no one can be notified.\\r\\nThe Rostovs have waited until the last minute to abandon Moscow, even after it is clear that Kutuzov has retreated past Moscow and Muscovites are being given contradictory instructions on how to either flee or fight. Count Rostopchin, the commander in chief of Moscow, is publishing posters, rousing the citizens to put their faith in religious icons, while at the same time urging them to fight with pitchforks if necessary. Before fleeing himself, he gives orders to burn the city. The Rostovs have a difficult time deciding what to take with them, but in the end, Natasha convinces them to load their carts with the wounded and dying from the Battle of Borodino. Unknown to Natasha, Prince Andrei is amongst the wounded.\\r\\nWhen Napoleon's Grand Army finally occupies an abandoned and burning Moscow, Pierre takes off on a quixotic mission to assassinate Napoleon. He becomes anonymous in all the chaos, shedding his responsibilities by wearing peasant clothes and shunning his duties and lifestyle. The only people he sees are Natasha and some of her family, as they depart Moscow. Natasha recognizes and smiles at him, and he in turn realizes the full scope of his love for her.\\r\\nPierre saves the life of a French officer who fought at Borodino, yet is taken prisoner by the retreating French during his attempted assassination of Napoleon, after saving a woman from being raped by soldiers in the French Army.\\r\\nPierre becomes friends with a fellow prisoner, Platon Karataev, a Russian peasant with a saintly demeanor. In Karataev, Pierre finally finds what he has been seeking: an honest person of integrity, who is utterly without pretense. Pierre discovers meaning in life simply by interacting with him. After witnessing French soldiers sacking Moscow and shooting Russian civilians arbitrarily, Pierre is forced to march with the Grand Army during its disastrous retreat from Moscow in the harsh Russian winter. After months of trial and tribulationduring which the fever-plagued Karataev is shot by the FrenchPierre is finally freed by a Russian raiding party led by Dolokhov and Denisov, after a small skirmish with the French that sees the young Petya Rostov killed in action.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Andrei has been taken in and cared for by the Rostovs, fleeing from Moscow to Yaroslavl. He is reunited with Natasha and his sister Maria before the end of the war. Having lost all will to live, he forgives Natasha in a last act before dying.\\r\\nAs the novel draws to a close, Pierre's wife Hlne dies from an overdose of an abortifacient (Tolstoy does not state it explicitly but the euphemism he uses is unambiguous). Pierre is reunited with Natasha, while the victorious Russians rebuild Moscow. Natasha speaks of Prince Andrei's death and Pierre of Karataev's. Both are aware of a growing bond between them in their bereavement. With the help of Princess Maria, Pierre finds love at last and marries Natasha.\\r\\nThe first part of the epilogue begins with the wedding of Pierre and Natasha in 1813. Count Rostov dies soon after, leaving his eldest son Nikolai to take charge of the debt-ridden estate. Nikolai finds himself with the task of maintaining the family on the verge of bankruptcy. His abhorrence at the idea of marrying for wealth almost gets in his way, but finally he marries the now-rich Maria Bolkonskaya and in so doing saves his family from financial ruin (though manages to do so without selling any of his wife's property).\\r\\nNikolai and Maria then move to Bald Hills with his mother and Sonya, whom he supports for the rest of their lives. They also raise Prince Andrei's orphaned son, Nikolai Andreyevich (Nikolenka) Bolkonsky.\\r\\nAs in all good marriages, there are misunderstandings, but the couplesPierre and Natasha, Nikolai and Mariaremain devoted to their spouses. Pierre and Natasha visit Bald Hills in 1820. There is a hint in the closing chapters that the idealistic, boyish Nikolenka and Pierre would both become part of the Decembrist Uprising. The first epilogue concludes with Nikolenka promising he would do something with which even his late father \\"would be satisfied\\" (presumably as a revolutionary in the Decembrist revolt).\\r\\nThe second part of the epilogue contains Tolstoy's critique of all existing forms of mainstream history. The 19th-century Great Man Theory claims that historical events are the result of the actions of \\"heroes\\" and other great individuals; Tolstoy argues that this is impossible because of how rarely these actions result in great historical events. Rather, he argues, great historical events are the result of many smaller events driven by the thousands of individuals involved (he compares this to calculus, and the sum of infinitesimals). He then goes on to argue that these smaller events are the result of an inverse relationship between necessity and free-will, necessity being based on reason and therefore explainable by historical analysis, and free-will being based on \\"consciousness\\" and therefore inherently unpredictable.\\r\\nThe novel that made its author \\"the true lion of the Russian literature\\" (according to Ivan Goncharov)[19][20] enjoyed great success with the reading public upon its publication and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays, some of which (by Dmitry Pisarev, Pavel Annenkov, Dragomirov and Strakhov) formed the basis for the research of later Tolstoy scholars.[20] Yet the Russian press's initial response to the novel was muted, most critics unable to decide how to classify it. The liberal newspaper Golos (The Voice, April 3, #93, 1865) was one of the first to react. Its anonymous reviewer posed a question later repeated by many others: \\"What could this possibly be? What kind of genre are we supposed to file it to?.. Where is fiction in it, and where is real history?\\"[20]\\r\\nWriter and critic Nikolai Akhsharumov, writing in Vsemirny Trud (#6, 1867) suggested that War and Peace was \\"neither a chronicle, nor a historical novel\\", but a genre merger, this ambiguity never undermining its immense value. Annenkov, who praised the novel too, was equally vague when trying to classify it. \\"The cultural history of one large section of our society, the political and social panorama of it in the beginning of the current century\\", was his suggestion. \\"It is the [social] epic, the history novel and the vast picture of the whole nation's life\\", wrote Ivan Turgenev in his bid to define War and Peace in the foreword for his French translation of \\"The Two Hussars\\" (published in Paris by Le Temps in 1875).\\r\\nIn general, the literary left received the novel coldly. They saw it as devoid of social critique, and keen on the idea of national unity. They saw its major fault as the \\"author's inability to portray a new kind of revolutionary intelligentsia in his novel\\", as critic Varfolomey Zaytsev put it.[21] Articles by D. Minayev, V. Bervi-Flerovsky and N. Shelgunov in Delo magazine characterized the novel as \\"lacking realism\\", showing its characters as \\"cruel and rough\\", \\"mentally stoned\\", \\"morally depraved\\" and promoting \\"the philosophy of stagnation\\". Still, Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin, who never expressed his opinion of the novel publicly, in private conversation was reported to have expressed delight with \\"how strongly this Count has stung our higher society\\".[22] Dmitry Pisarev in his unfinished article \\"Russian Gentry of Old\\" (Staroye barstvo, Otechestvennye Zapiski, #2, 1868), while praising Tolstoy's realism in portraying members of high society, was still unhappy with the way the author, as he saw it, 'idealized' the old nobility, expressing \\"unconscious and quite natural tenderness towards\\" the Russian dvoryanstvo. On the opposite front, the conservative press and \\"patriotic\\" authors (A. S. Norov and P. A. Vyazemsky among them) were accusing Tolstoy of consciously distorting 1812 history, desecrating the \\"patriotic feelings of our fathers\\" and ridiculing dvoryanstvo.[20]\\r\\nOne of the first comprehensive articles on the novel was that of Pavel Annenkov, published in #2, 1868 issue of Vestnik Evropy. The critic praised Tolstoy's masterful portrayal of man at war, marveled at the complexity of the whole composition, organically merging historical facts and fiction. \\"The dazzling side of the novel\\", according to Annenkov, was \\"the natural simplicity with which [the author] transports the worldly affairs and big social events down to the level of a character who witnesses them.\\" Annekov thought the historical gallery of the novel was incomplete with the two \\"great raznotchintsys\\", Speransky and Arakcheev, and deplored the fact that the author stopped at introducing to the novel \\"this relatively rough but original element\\". In the end the critic called the novel \\"the whole epoch in the Russian fiction\\".[20]\\r\\nSlavophiles declared Tolstoy their \\"bogatyr\\" and pronounced War and Peace \\"the Bible of the new national idea\\". Several articles on War and Peace were published in 1869ÿ70 in Zarya magazine by Nikolai Strakhov. \\"War and Peace is the work of genius, equal to everything that the Russian literature has produced before\\", he pronounced in the first, smaller essay. \\"It is now quite clear that from 1868 when the War and Peace was published the very essence of what we call Russian literature has become quite different, acquired the new form and meaning\\", the critic continued later. Strakhov was the first critic in Russia who declared Tolstoy's novel to be a masterpiece of level previously unknown in Russian literature. Still, being a true Slavophile, he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major Slavophiliac ideas of \\"meek Russian character's supremacy over the rapacious European kind\\" (using Apollon Grigoriev's formula). Years later, in 1878, discussing Strakhov's own book The World as a Whole, Tolstoy criticized both Grigoriev's concept (of \\"Russian meekness vs. Western bestiality\\") and Strakhov's interpretation of it.[23]\\r\\nAmong the reviewers were military men and authors specializing in the war literature. Most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of Tolstoy's battle scenes. N. Lachinov, a member of the Russky Invalid newspaper staff (#69, April 10, 1868) called the Battle of Sch?ngrabern scenes \\"bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness\\" and totally agreed with the author's view on the Battle of Borodino, which some of his opponents disputed. The army general and respected military writer Mikhail Dragomirov, in an article published in Oruzheiny Sbornik (The Military Almanac, 1868ÿ70), while disputing some of Tolstoy's ideas concerning the \\"spontaneity\\" of wars and the role of commander in battles, advised all the Russian Army officers to use War and Peace as their desk book, describing its battle scenes as \\"incomparable\\" and \\"serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theories of military art.\\"[20]\\r\\nUnlike professional literary critics, most prominent Russian writers of the time supported the novel wholeheartedly. Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Dostoyevsky and Fet have all gone on record as declaring War and Peace the masterpiece of the Russian literature. Ivan Goncharov in a July 17, 1878 letter to Pyotr Ganzen advised him to choose for translating into Danish War and Peace, adding: \\"This is positively what might be called a Russian Iliad. Embracing the whole epoch, it is the grandiose literary event, showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively brush of the great master ... This is one of the most, if not the most profound literary work ever.[24] In 1879, unhappy with Ganzen having chosen Anna Karenina to start with, Goncharov insisted: \\"War and Peace is the extraordinary poem of a novel, both in content and execution. It also serves as a monument to Russian history's glorious epoch when whatever figure you take is a colossus, a statue in bronze. Even [the novel's] minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the Russian people and its life.\\"[25] In 1885, expressing satisfaction with the fact that Tolstoy's works have now been translated into Danish, Goncharov again stressed the immense importance of War and Peace. \\"Count Tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here [in Russia]\\", he remarked.[26]\\r\\nFyodor Dostoyevsky (in a May 30, 1871 letter to Strakhov) described War and Peace as \\"the last word of the landlord's literature and the brilliant one at that\\". In a draft version of The Raw Youth he described Tolstoy as \\"a historiograph of the dvoryanstvo, or rather, its cultural elite\\". \\"The objectivity and realism impart wonderful charm to all scenes, and alongside people of talent, honour and duty he exposes numerous scoundrels, worthless goons and fools\\", he added.[27] In 1876 Dostoyevsky wrote: \\"My strong conviction is that a writer of fiction has to have most profound knowledgenot only of the poetic side of his art, but also the reality he deals with, in its historical as well as contemporary context. Here [in Russia], as far as I see it, only one writer excels in this, Count Lev Tolstoy.\\"[28]\\r\\nNikolai Leskov, then an anonymous reviewer in Birzhevy Vestnik (The Stock Exchange Herald), wrote several articles praising highly War and Peace, calling it \\"the best ever Russian historical novel\\" and \\"the pride of the contemporary literature\\". Marveling at the realism and factual truthfulness of Tolstoy's book, Leskov thought the author deserved the special credit for \\"having lifted up the people's spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved\\". \\"While working most elaborately upon individual characters, the author, apparently, has been studying most diligently the character of the nation as a whole; the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the Army that came up to fight mighty Napoleon. In this respect the novel of Count Tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the Great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers\\", Leskov wrote.[20]\\r\\nAfanasy Fet, in a January 1, 1870 letter to Tolstoy, expressed his great delight with the novel. \\"You've managed to show us in great detail the other, mundane side of life and explain how organically does it feed the outer, heroic side of it\\", he added.[29]\\r\\nIvan Turgenev gradually re-considered his initial skepticism as to the novels historical aspect and also the style of Tolstoy's psychological analysis. In his 1880 article written in the form of a letter addressed to Edmond Abou, the editor of the French newspaper Le XIXe Sicle, Turgenev described Tolstoy as \\"the most popular Russian writer\\" and War and Peace as \\"one of the most remarkable books of our age\\".[30] \\"This vast work has the spirit of an epic, where the life of Russia of the beginning of our century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master ... The manner in which Count Tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original. This is the great work of a great writer, and in it theres true, real Russia\\", Turgenev wrote.[31] It was largely due to Turgenev's efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the European readership. The first French edition of the War and Peace (1879) paved the way for the worldwide success of Leo Tolstoy and his works.[20]\\r\\nSince then many world famous authors have praised War and Peace as a masterpiece of the world literature. Gustave Flaubert expressed his delight in a January 1880 letter to Turgenev, writing: \\"This is the first class work! What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite. I used to utter shrieks of delight while reading. This is powerful, very powerful indeed.\\"[32] Later John Galsworthy called War and Peace \\"the best novel that had ever been written\\". Romain Rolland, remembering his reading the novel as a student, wrote: \\"this work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement.\\"[33] Thomas Mann thought War and Peace to be \\"the greatest ever war novel in the history of literature.\\"[34] Ernest Hemingway confessed that it was from Tolstoy that he'd been taking lessons on how to \\"write about war in the most straightforward, honest, objective and stark way.\\" \\"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did\\", Hemingway asserted in his 1955 Men at War. The Best War Stories of All Time anthology.[20]\\r\\nIsaak Babel said, after reading War and Peace, \\"If the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.\\"[35] Tolstoy \\"gives us a unique combination of the 'naive objectivity' of the oral narrator with the interest in detail characteristic of realism. This is the reason for our trust in his presentation.\\"[36]\\r\\nWar and Peace has been translated into many languages. It has been translated into English on several occasions, starting with Clara Bell working from a French translation. The translators Constance Garnett and Louise and Aylmer Maude knew Tolstoy personally. Translations have to deal with Tolstoys often peculiar syntax and his fondness for repetitions.Only about 2 percent of War and Peace is in French; Tolstoy removed the French in a revised 1873 edition, only to restore it later.[14] Most translators follow Garnett retaining some French, Briggs uses no French, while Pevear-Volokhonsky and Amy Mandelker's revision of the Maude translation both retain the French fully.[14] (For a list of translations see below.)\\r\\nIn the Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English, academic Zoja Pavlovskis-Petit has this to say about the translations of War and Peace available in 2000: \\"Of all the translations of War and Peace, Dunnigan's (1968) is the best. ... Unlike the other translators, Dunnigan even succeeds with many characteristically Russian folk expressions and proverbs. ... She is faithful to the text and does not hesitate to render conscientiously those details that the uninitiated may find bewildering: for instance, the statement that Boris's mother pronounced his name with a stress on the o ÿ an indication to the Russian reader of the old lady's affectation.\\"\\r\\nOn the Garnett translation Pavlovskis-Petit writes: \\"her ...War and Peace is frequently inexact and contains too many anglicisms. Her style is awkward and turgid, very unsuitable for Tolstoi.\\" On the Maudes' translation she comments: \\"this should have been the best translation, but the Maudes' lack of adroitness in dealing with Russian folk idiom, and their style in general, place this version below Dunnigan's.\\" She further comments on Edmonds's revised translation, formerly on Penguin: \\"[it] is the work of a sound scholar but not the best possible translator; it frequently lacks resourcefulness and imagination in its use of English. ... a respectable translation but not on the level of Dunnigan or Maude.\\"[37]","input":"Who wrote the classic novel war and peace?"},{"output":"about 500","context":"Volcanology of Chile studies a continuous volcanic process that has a strong influence on Chilean landscape, geology, economy and society.

It was the second team representing Pune after Pune Warriors India. The team along with Gujarat Lions featured as two-season replacements for Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, who were suspended due to their involvement in illegal betting by their respective owners.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rising Pune Supergiant franchise is owned by RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group controlled by Sanjiv Goenka.[2] The team name was announced (as Rising Pune Supergiants) on 18 January 2016 by Goenka in Kolkata and Raghu Iyer was appointed CEO.[3] The owners changed the team name to Rising Pune Supergiant on 26 March 2017.[4] The team lost the 2017 IPL Final to Mumbai Indians by 1 run, which was the team's last game in the IPL.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rising Pune Supergiant's home ground was the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. However, controversies arose over holding 2016 IPL games in Maharashtra due to water usage of the cricket stadiums during severe drought and the Bombay High Court ordered all matches in May to be shifted out of the state.[7] On 15 April 2016, it was reported that the Rising Pune Supergiants were considering the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Vishakhapatnam as an alternate home ground.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official merchandise was provided by SEVEN and the principal shirt sponsor was Jio, Kent RO Systems. Spykar, Gulf Oil, Gemini Oil, Finolex Pipes, LYF Smartphones, DBS Bank and Marriott International were the associated sponsors for 2016 season. They also signed tournament partners such as OLA, Kingfishers, Deakin University, New India Assurance, Gourmet Renaissance and Fan Garage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rising Pune Supergiant made an excellent start to the season, convincingly winning their first game against the defending champions, Mumbai Indians, by 9 wickets. However, they went on to lose their next four games - against the Gujarat Lions, Kings XI Punjab, Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Kolkata Knight Riders. The inclusion of Ashoke Dinda, in their 6th game of the season, provided a brief inspiration as the Supergiants beat the Sunrisers Hyderabad by 34 runs. They lost the next two games - against the Gujarat Lions and the Mumbai Indians - at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. The Supergiants were also briefly bolstered by the arrival of Australian batsmen Usman Khawaja and George Bailey against the Delhi Daredevils at the Feroz Shah Kotla and went on to win the game by 7 wickets.[9] Pune's last game of the season was against Kings XI Punjab, with the loser finishing at the bottom of the points table. RPS was struggling to chase down a total of 172 despite a good start from the openers and they kept losing wickets at constant intervals. RPS needed 23 runs from the last over which was bowled by Axar Patel with captain MS Dhoni on the crease. After a wide, four, six and two dot balls, RPS were left requiring 12 runs from the last two balls. It seemed the game was over but Dhoni pulled off the incredible and hit two sixes off the last two balls. This win ensured RPS didn't finish at the bottom of the points table.[10] At the end of the 2016 IPL, the Supergiants won only 5 games out of 14, and won only 2 of their 7 home games - 4 at the MCA Stadium in Pune and 3 at their new home ground, the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Vishakhapatnam. They finished at seventh place in the IPL points table.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the auction, Pune axed MS Dhoni as captain and Steve Smith was appointed captain barely months before the start of the 2017 season.[12] The franchise then changed their name to Rising Pune Supergiant, removing the 's', on 26 March 2017.[4] Washington Sundar replaced Ravichandran Ashwin who was ruled out of the tournament with a sports hernia.[13] RPS bought Ben Stokes for ?14.5 Crore at the auction, making him the most expensive overseas player in the history of the IPL.[14] Imran Tahir was roped in by RPS as a replacement for Mitchell Marsh, who was once again ruled out of the tournament due to a shoulder injury.[15] This decision proved to be extremely decisive, as Imran Tahir went on to take 18 wickets in 12 games for RPS before leaving for his national team, along with Faf du Plessis.\\r\\n\\r\\nRPS once again got off to a great start in IPL 2017 by beating the Mumbai Indians by 7 wickets in their first game. However, losses against Kings XI Punjab, Delhi Daredevils and Gujarat Lions followed and it seemed like Pune were repeating what took place last year. However, results picked up and RPS won 7 out of their next 8 games, all of them by close margins, with the top performers being Rahul Tripathi, Jaydev Unadkat, Ben Stokes and Imran Tahir. But a 6-day gap left them rusty and RPS lost to Delhi Daredevils by 7 runs, forcing them to win their last game vs Punjab to qualify. In their do-or-die game vs Punjab, RPS skittled them out for 73 and won comfortably by 9 wickets, thus finishing in second place with 18 points and qualifying for the play-offs. \\r\\n\\r\\nRPS faced the Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 1 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, with a win securing them a spot in the final. RPS batted first and posted a slightly below-par total of 162-4, with 41 runs coming from the last two overs, thanks to well-paced innings from Manoj Tiwary and Ajinkya Rahane and a late surge from MS Dhoni. Washington Sundar ripped apart the middle order of the Indians and finished with career best figures of 3-16 in 4 overs. Shardul Thakur and Jaydev Unadkat chipped in as Pune beat the Mumbai Indians comfortably by 20 runs.\\r\\n\\r\\nRPS faced the Mumbai Indians for the fourth time in the season, in the final at Hyderabad. This was Rising Pune Supergiant's last game in the IPL. RPS had a psychological edge over Mumbai, considering RPS had beaten them on all three meetings in the season. Rohit Sharma won the toss and decided to bat first. Jaydev Unadkat and Adam Zampa took key wickets as Mumbai crumbled to 79-7 but a late surge from Krunal Pandya meant that Mumbai finished with a slightly-below par score of 129-8. RPS looked comfortable after the powerplay but over-cautious batting cost them dearly. Ajinkya Rahane scored runs easily but captain Steve Smith struggled and things took a turn when Rahane got out for 44. MS Dhoni arrived but was quickly removed for 10 and Pune were left requiring 11 runs from the last over with Smith and Manoj Tiwary at the crease. Tiwary hit a four on the first ball off Mitchell Johnson's bowling and RPS looked to have the trophy in the bag. But Smith and Tiwary got out off consecutive deliveries which left RPS requiring 7 runs from 3 balls. A single from Washington Sundar and a double from Daniel Christian meant RPS required 4 runs from the last ball. Unfortunately, RPS could only complete two runs before Sundar was run out. Thus, Mumbai Indians won by 1 run to get their 3rd IPL title.","input":"Who is the owner of rising pune supergiants?"},{"output":"ethanol","context":"An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains alcohol (ethanol), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism.\\r\\nDrinking alcohol plays an important social role in many cultures. Most countries have laws regulating the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages.[1] Some countries ban such activities entirely, but alcoholic drinks are legal in most parts of the world. The global alcoholic drink industry exceeded $1 trillion in 2014.[2]\\r\\nAlcohol is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world. For instance, in 2015, among Americans, 89% of adults had consumed alcohol at some point, 70% had drunk it in the last year, and 56% in the last month.[3] Alcoholic drinks are typically divided into three classesbeers, wines, and spiritsand typically contain between 3% and 40% of alcohol by volume.\\r\\nDiscovery of late Stone Age jugs suggest that intentionally fermented drinks existed at least as early as the Neolithic period (cir. 10,000 BC).[4] Many animals also consume alcohol when given the opportunity and are affected in much the same way as humans, although humans are the only species known to produce alcoholic drinks intentionally.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWine is a fermented beverage produced from grapes. Wine involves a longer fermentation process than beer and also a long aging process (months or years), resulting in an alcohol content of 9%ÿ16% ABV. Sparkling wine can be made by means of a secondary fermentation.\\r\\n\\"Fruit wines\\" are made from fruits other than grapes, such as plums, cherries, or apples. Sake is a popular example of \\"rice wine\\".\\r\\nBeer is a beverage fermented from grain mash. It is typically made from barley or a blend of several grains and flavored with hops. Most beer is naturally carbonated as part of the fermentation process. If the fermented mash is distilled, then the drink becomes a spirit. In the Andean region, the most common beer is chicha, made from grain or fruits.[6] Beer is the most consumed alcoholic beverage in the world.[7]\\r\\nCider or cyder (/?sa?d?r/ SY-d?r) is a fermented alcoholic drink made from any fruit juice; apple juice (traditional and most common), peaches, pears (\\"Perry\\" cider) or other fruit. Cider alcohol content varies from 1.2% ABV to 8.5% or more in traditional English ciders. In some regions, cider may be called \\"apple wine\\".[8]\\r\\nMead (/mi?d/) is an alcoholic drink made by fermenting honey with water, sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or hops. The alcoholic content of mead may range from about 8% ABV to more than 20%. The defining characteristic of mead is that the majority of the drink's fermentable sugar is derived from honey.\\r\\nPulque is the Mesoamerican fermented drink made from the \\"honey water\\" of maguey cacti. The drink distilled from pulque is tequila or mescal.[9]\\r\\nA distilled drink or liquor is an alcoholic drink produced by distilling (i.e., concentrating by distillation) ethanol produced by means of fermenting grain, fruit, or vegetables.[10] Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic drinks that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits.[11] For the most common distilled drinks, such as whiskey and vodka, the alcohol content is around 40%. The term hard liquor is used in North America to distinguish distilled drinks from undistilled ones (implicitly weaker). Vodka, gin, baijiu, tequila, whiskey, brandy, and soju are examples of distilled drinks. Distilling concentrates the alcohol and eliminates some of the congeners. Freeze distillation concentrates ethanol along with methanol and fusel alcohols (fermentation by-products partially removed by distillation) in applejack.\\r\\nFortified wine is wine, such as port or sherry, to which a distilled beverage (usually brandy) has been added.[12] Fortified wine is distinguished from spirits made from wine in that spirits are produced by means of distillation, while fortified wine is simply wine that has had a spirit added to it. Many different styles of fortified wine have been developed, including port, sherry, madeira, marsala, commandaria, and the aromatized wine vermouth.[13]\\r\\nRectified spirit, also called \\"neutral grain spirit,\\" is alcohol which has been purified by means of \\"rectification\\" (i.e. repeated distillation). The term neutral refers to the spirit's lack of the flavor that would have been present if the mash ingredients had been distilled to a lower level of alcoholic purity. Rectified spirit also lacks any flavoring added to it after distillation (as is done, for example, with gin). Other kinds of spirits, such as whiskey, are distilled to a lower alcohol percentage to preserve the flavor of the mash.\\r\\nRectified spirit is a clear, colorless, flammable liquid that may contain as much as 95% ABV. It is often used for medicinal purposes. It may be a grain spirit or it may be made from other plants. It is used in mixed drinks, liqueurs, and tinctures, and also as a household solvent.\\r\\nWine, beer, distilled spirits and other alcoholic drinks contain ethyl alcohol and alcohol consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the wine, beer or spirits and the timespan that the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Alcohol in carbonated drinks is absorbed faster than alcohol in non-carbonated drinks.[14]\\r\\nDrinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties against drunk driving.\\r\\nThe main active ingredient of wine, beer and distilled spirits is alcohol. Drinking small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men per day) is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus and early death.[16] Drinking more than this amount, however, increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke.[16] The risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents.[16] About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all global deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year.[17] Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years[18] and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States.[16] No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine.[16][19] Another long-term effect of alcohol usage, when also used with tobacco products, is alcohol acting as a solvent, which allows harmful chemicals in tobacco to get inside the cells that line the digestive tract. Alcohol slows these cells' healing ability to repair the damage to their DNA caused by the harmful chemicals in tobacco. Alcohol contributes to cancer through this process.[20]\\r\\nWhile lower quality evidence suggest a cardioprotective effect, no controlled studies have been completed on the effect of alcohol on the risk of developing heart disease or stroke. Excessive consumption of alcohol can cause liver cirrhosis and alcoholism.[21] The American Heart Association \\"cautions people NOT to start drinking ... if they do not already drink alcohol. Consult your doctor on the benefits and risks of consuming alcohol in moderation.\\"[22]\\r\\nAlcoholic drinks are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a Group 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic to humans). IARC classifies alcoholic drink consumption as a cause of female breast, colorectum, larynx, liver, esophagus, oral cavity, and pharynx cancers; and as a probable cause of pancreatic cancer.[23]\\r\\nIn the alcoholic drinks industry, congeners are substances produced during fermentation. These substances include small amounts of chemicals such as occasionally desired other alcohols, like propanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol, but also compounds that are never desired such as acetone, acetaldehyde and glycols. Congeners are responsible for most of the taste and aroma of distilled alcoholic drinks, and contribute to the taste of non-distilled drinks.[24] It has been suggested that these substances contribute to the symptoms of a hangover.[25] Tannins are congeners found in wine in the presence of phenolic compounds. Wine tannins add bitterness, have a drying sensation, taste herbaceous and are often described as astringent. Wine tannins adds balance, complexity, structure and makes a wine last longer, so they play an important role in the aging of wine.[26]\\r\\nAlcoholic drinks are a source of food energy. The USDA uses a figure of 6.93 kilocalories (29.0?kJ) per gram of alcohol (5.47?kcal (22.9?kJ) per ml) for calculating food energy.[27] In addition to alcohol, many alcoholic drinks contain carbohydrates. For example, along with approximately 96 calories from alcohol in 12?US?fl?oz (355?ml) of 5% ABV beer, there are usually 10ÿ15?g of carbohydrates (40ÿ60?kcal or 170ÿ250?kJ).[citation needed] Excessive daily calorie intake may contribute to an increase in body weight and so-called \\"beer belly\\". In addition to the direct effect of its caloric content, alcohol is also known to potentiate the insulin response of the human body to glucose, which, in essence, \\"instructs\\" the body to convert consumed carbohydrates into fat and to suppress carbohydrate and fat oxidation.[28][29] Ethanol is directly processed in the liver to acetyl CoA, the same intermediate product as in glucose metabolism. Because ethanol can only be metabolized and consumed by the liver, chronic excessive use can lead to fatty liver. This leads to a chronic inflammation of the liver and eventually alcoholic liver disease.\\r\\nAn apritif is any alcoholic beverage usually served before a meal to stimulate the appetite,[30] while a digestif is any alcoholic beverage served after a meal for the stated purpose of improving digestion. Fortified wine, liqueurs, and dry champagne are common apritifs. Because apritifs are served before dining, they are usually dry rather than sweet. One example is Cinzano, a brand of vermouth. Digestifs include brandy, fortified wines and herb-infused spirits (Drambuie).\\r\\nPure ethanol tastes bitter to humans; some people also describe it as sweet.[31] However, ethanol is also a moderately good solvent for many fatty substances and essential oils. This facilitates the use of flavoring and coloring compounds in alcoholic drinks as a taste mask, especially in distilled drinks. Some flavors may be naturally present in the beverage's raw material. Beer and wine may also be flavored before fermentation, and spirits may be flavored before, during, or after distillation. Sometimes flavor is obtained by allowing the beverage to stand for months or years in oak barrels, usually made of American or French oak. A few brands of spirits may also have fruit or herbs inserted into the bottle at the time of bottling.\\r\\nWine is important in cuisine not just for its value as an accompanying beverage, but as a flavor agent, primarily in stocks and braising, since its acidity lends balance to rich savory or sweet dishes.[32] Wine sauce is an example of a culinary sauce that uses wine as a primary ingredient.[33] Natural wines may exhibit a broad range of alcohol content, from below 9% to above 16% ABV, with most wines being in the 12.5ÿ14.5% range.[34] Fortified wines (usually with brandy) may contain 20% alcohol or more.\\r\\nThe concentration of alcohol in a beverage is usually stated as the percentage of alcohol by volume? (ABV, the number of milliliters (ml) of pure ethanol in 100 ml of beverage) or as proof. In the United States, proof is twice the percentage of alcohol by volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (e.g. 80 proof = 40% ABV). Degrees proof were formerly used in the United Kingdom, where 100 degrees proof was equivalent to 57.1% ABV. Historically, this was the most dilute spirit that would sustain the combustion of gunpowder.\\r\\nOrdinary distillation cannot produce alcohol of more than 95.6% by weight, which is about 97.2% ABV (194.4 proof) because at that point alcohol is an azeotrope with water. A spirit which contains a very high level of alcohol and does not contain any added flavoring is commonly called a neutral spirit. Generally, any distilled alcoholic beverage of 170 US proof or higher is considered to be a neutral spirit.[36]\\r\\nMost yeasts cannot reproduce when the concentration of alcohol is higher than about 18%, so that is the practical limit for the strength of fermented drinks such as wine, beer, and sake. However, some strains of yeast have been developed that can reproduce in solutions of up to 25% ABV.[37]\\r\\nShot sizes vary significantly from country to country. In the United Kingdom, serving size in licensed premises is regulated under the Weights and Measures Act (1985). A single serving size of spirits (gin, whisky, rum, and vodka) are sold in 25 ml or 35 ml quantities or multiples thereof.[38] Beer is typically served in pints (568?ml), but is also served in half-pints or third-pints. In Israel, a single serving size of spirits is about twice as much, 50 or 60 mL.\\r\\nThe shape of a glass can have a significant effect on how much one pours. A Cornell University study of students and bartenders' pouring showed both groups pour more into short, wide glasses than into tall, slender glasses.[39] Aiming to pour one shot of alcohol (1.5 ounces or 44.3 ml), students on average poured 45.5 ml & 59.6 ml (30% more) respectively into the tall and short glasses. The bartenders scored similarly, on average pouring 20.5% more into the short glasses. More experienced bartenders were more accurate, pouring 10.3% less alcohol than less experienced bartenders. Practice reduced the tendency of both groups to over pour for tall, slender glasses but not for short, wide glasses. These misperceptions are attributed to two perceptual biases: (1) Estimating that tall, slender glasses have more volume than shorter, wider glasses; and (2) Over focusing on the height of the liquid and disregarding the width.\\r\\nA standard drink is a notional drink that contains a specified amount of pure alcohol. The standard drink is used in many countries to quantify alcohol intake. It is usually expressed as a measure of beer, wine, or spirits. One standard drink always contains the same amount of alcohol regardless of serving size or the type of alcoholic beverage. The standard drink varies significantly from country to country. For example, it is 7.62?ml (6?grams) of alcohol in Austria, but in Japan it is 25?ml (19.75?grams).\\r\\n\\r\\nAlcohol laws regulate the manufacture, packaging, labelling, distribution, sale, consumption, blood alcohol content of motor vehicle drivers, open containers, and transportation of alcoholic drinks. Such laws generally seek to reduce the adverse health and social impacts of alcohol consumption. In particular, alcohol laws set the legal drinking age, which usually varies between 16 and 25 years, sometimes depending upon the type of drink (e.g., beer vs. hard liquor). Some countries do not have a legal drinking or purchasing age, but most countries set the minimum age at 18 years.[1] Such laws may take the form of permitting distribution only to licensed stores, monopoly stores, or pubs and they are often combined with taxation, which serves to reduce the demand for alcohol (by raising its price) and it is a form of revenue for governments. These laws also often limit the hours or days (e.g., \\"blue laws\\") on which alcohol may be sold or served, as can also be seen in the \\"last call\\" ritual in US and Canadian bars, where bartenders and servers ask patrons to place their last orders for alcohol, due to serving hour cutoff laws. In some countries, alcohol cannot be sold to a person who is already intoxicated. Alcohol laws in many countries prohibit drunk driving.\\r\\nIn some jurisdictions, alcoholic drinks are totally prohibited for reasons of religion (e.g., Islamic countries with sharia law) or for reasons of local option, public health, and morals (e.g., Prohibition in the United States from 1920 to 1933). In jurisdictions which enforce sharia law, the consumption of alcoholic drinks is an illegal offense,[40] although such laws may exempt non-Muslims.[41]","input":"What kind of alcohol is in alcoholic beverages?"},{"output":"Raja Raja Chola I","context":"Brihadeeswarar Temple, also referred to as Rajesvara Peruvudaiyar or Brihadishvara Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva located in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India.[1][3] It is one of the largest South Indian temple and an exemplary example of a fully realized Tamil architecture.[4] Built by Raja Raja Chola I between 1003 and 1010 AD, the temple is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the \\"Great Living Chola Temples\\", along with the Chola dynasty era Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple and Airavatesvara temple that are about 70 kilometres (43?mi) and 40 kilometres (25?mi) to its northeast respectively.[5]\\r\\nThe original monuments of this 11th century temple were built around a moat. It included gopura, the main temple, its massive tower, inscriptions, frescoes and sculptures predominantly related to Shaivism, but also of Vaishnvaism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism. The temple was damaged in its history and some artwork is now missing. Additional mandapam and monuments were added in centuries that followed. The temple now stands amidst fortified walls that were added after the 16th century.[6][7]\\r\\nBuilt out of granite, the vimanam tower above the sanctum is one of the tallest in South India.[3] The temple has a massive colonnaded prakara (corridor) and one of the largest Shiva linga in India.[3][5][8] It is also famed for the quality of its sculpture, as well as being the location that commissioned the brass Nataraja ÿ Shiva as the lord of dance, in 11th century. The complex includes shrines for Nandi, Amman, Subrahmanyar, Ganesha, Sabhapati, Dakshinamurti, Chandesrvarar, Varahi and others.[5][9] The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrihadishvara (IAST: B?ihdؐ?vara) is a Sanskrit composite word composed of Brihat which means \\"big, great, lofty, vast\\",[11] and Ishvara means \\"lord, Shiva, supreme being, supreme atman (soul)\\".[12][13] The name means the \\"great lord, big Shiva\\" temple. Locally, the temple is called the big temple, while in historic inscriptions it is also referred to as the RajaRajeswara, Rajarajeswaram and Peruvudayar temple.[14]\\r\\nThe Brihadeeswarar Temple is located in the city of Thanjavur, about 350 kilometres (220?mi) southwest of Chennai. The city is connected daily to other major cities by the network of Indian Railways, Tamil Nadu bus services and the National Highways 67, 45C, 226 and 226 Extn.[15][16] The site has a nearby airport (IATA: TJV) which does not have a regular air service. The nearest airport with regular services is Tiruchirappalli International Airport (IATA: TRZ), about 55 kilometres (34?mi) away.[17]\\r\\nThe city and the temple though inland, are at the start of the Cauveri River delta, thus with access to the Bay of Bengal and through it to the Indian Ocean. Along with the temples, the Tamil people completed the first major irrigation network in the 11th century for agriculture, for movement of goods and to control the water flow through the urban center.[18]\\r\\nA spectrum of Hindu temple styles continued to develop from the 5th to the 9th century over the Chalukya era rule as evidenced in Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal, and then with the Pallava era as witnessed at Mamallapuram and other monuments. Thereafter, between 850 and 1280 CE, Cholas emerged as the dominant dynasty.[2][19] The early Chola period saw a greater emphasis on securing their geopolitical boundaries and less emphasis on architecture. In the 10th century, within the Chola empire emerged features such as the multifaceted columns with projecting square capitals. This, states George Michell, signaled the start of the new Chola style.[2][note 1] This South Indian style is most fully realized both in scale and detail in the Brihadeshvara temple built between 1003 and 1010 by the Chola king Rajaraja.[1][2] The architect and engineer of the temple was Kunjara Mallan Raja Raja Rama Perunthachan as stated in inscriptions found at the temple.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe main temple along with its gopurams are from the early 11th century. The temple also saw additions, renovations, and repairs over the next 1,000 years. The raids and wars, particularly between Muslim Sultans who controlled Madurai and Hindu kings who controlled Thanjavur caused damage.[7][note 2] These were repaired by Hindu dynasties that regained control. In some cases, the rulers attempted to renovate the temple with faded paintings, by ordering new murals on top of the older ones. In other cases, they sponsored addition of shrines. The significant shrines of Subrahmanyar, Amman and Nandi are from the 16th and 17th-century Nayaka era.[7][23] Similarly the Dakshinamurti shrine was built later. According to an inscription dated 1801, the Marathas made elaborate repairs to the shrines of Ganesha, Subrahmanyar, Amman, Sabhapati which houses the Nataraja bronze, Dakshinamurti, Chandesrvarar, mandapas and the prakara walls. They also rebuilt the temple kitchen and put in a new floor in the courtyard.[23]\\r\\nThe Brihadeshvara temple plan and development utilizes the axial and symmetrical geometry rules.[24] The temple complex is a rectangle that is almost two stacked squares, convering 240.79 metres (790.0?ft) east to west, and 121.92 metres (400.0?ft) north to south. In this space are five main sections: the sanctum with the towering superstructure (sri vimana), the Nandi hall in front (Nandi-mandapam) and in between these the main community hall (mukhamandapam), the great gathering hall (mahamandapam) and the pavilion that connects the great hall with the sanctum (ardhamandapam).[25]\\r\\nThe temple complex integrates a large pillared and covered veranda (prakara) in its spacious courtyard, with a perimeter of about 450 metres (1,480?ft) for circumambulation. Outside this pillared veranda there are two walls of enclosure, the outer one being defensive and added in 1777 CE by the French colonial forces with gun-holes with the temple serving as an arsenal. They made the outer wall high, isolating the temple complex area. On its east end is the original main gopuram or gateway that is barrel vaulted. It is less than half the size of the main temple's vimana. Additional structures were added to the original temple after the 11th century, such as a mandapa in its northeast corner and additional gopurams (gateways) on its perimeters to allow people to enter and leave from multiple locations.[25][26] Some of the shrines and structures were added during the Pandya, Nayaka, Vijayanagara and Maratha era, before the colonial era started, and these builders respected the original plans and symmetry rules. Inside the original temple courtyard, along with the main sanctum and Nandi-mandapam are two major shrines, one for Subrahmanyar (Murugan, Kartikeya) and for Amman. The complex has additional smaller shrines.[25][27][28]\\r\\nThe Brihadisvara temple continued the Hindu temple traditions of South India by adopting architectural and decorative elements, but its scale significantly exceeded the temples constructed before the 11th century. The Chola era architects and artisans innovated the expertise to scale up and build, particularly with heavy stone and to accomplish the 63.4 metres (208?ft) high towering vimana.[27][25]\\r\\nThe temple faces east, and once had a water moat around it. This has been filled up. The fortified wall now runs around this moat. The two walls have ornate gateways called the gopurams. These are made from stone and display entablature. The main gateways are on the east side. The first one is called the Keralantakan tiruvasal, which means the \\"sacred gate of the Keralantakan\\". The word Keralantakan was the surname of king Rajaraja who built it. About a 100 metres (330?ft) ahead is the inner courtyard gopuram called the Rajarajan tiruvasal. This is more decorated than the Keralantakan tiruvasal, such as with its adhishthanam relief work narrating scenes from the Puranas and other Hindu texts.[25] The inner eastern gopuram leads to a vast courtyard, in which the shrines are all signed to east-west and north-west cardinal directions. The complex can be entered either on one axis through a five-story gopuram or with a second access directly to the huge main quadrangle through a smaller free-standing gopuram. The gopuram of the main entrance is 30 m high, smaller than the vimana.[9]\\r\\nThe main temple-related monuments and the great tower is in the middle of this courtyard.[25] Around the main temple that is dedicated to Shiva, are smaller shrines, most of which are aligned axially. These are dedicated to Amman (Parvati), his sons Subrahmanya and Ganesha, Nandi, Varahi, Karuvurdevar, Chandikesvara and Nataraja.[9] The Nandi mandapam has a monolithic seated bull facing the sanctum. In between them are stairs leading to a columned porch and community gathering hall, then an inner mandapa connecting to the pradakshina patha, or circumambulation path. The Nandi (bull) facing the mukh-mandapam weighs about 25 tonnes.[29] It is made of a single stone and is about 2 m in height, 6 m in length and 2.5 m in width. The image of Nandi is a monolithic one and is one of the largest in the country.[30]\\r\\nThe sanctum is at the center of the western square. It is surrounded by massive walls that are divided into levels by sharply cut sculptures and pilasters providing deep bays and recesses. Each side of the sanctuary has a bay with iconography.[32][24] The interior of the sanctum sanctorum hosts an image of the primary deity, Shiva, in the form of a huge stone linga. It is called Karuvarai, a Tamil word that means \\"womb chamber\\". This space is called garbha griya in other parts of India. Only priests are allowed to enter this inner-most chamber.[33]\\r\\nIn the Dravida style, the Karuvarai takes the form of a miniature vimana. It has the inner wall together with the outer wall creating a pradakshina around the garbhagriha for circumambulation (pradakshina). The entrance is highly decorated. The inside chamber is the sanctum sanctorum, the garbhagriha, which houses the brihad linga.[2]\\r\\nThe main Vimanam (Shikhara) is a massive 16 storeys tower of which 13 are tapering squares. It dominates the main quadrangle. It sits above a 30.18 metres (99.0?ft) sided square.[32] The tower is elaborately articulated with Pilaster, piers(a raised structure), and attached columns which are placed rhythmically covering every surface of the Vimanam.[34]\\r\\nThe temple is dedicated to Shiva in the form of Lingam, his abstract aniconic representation. It is 8.7?m (29?ft) high, occupying two storeys of the sanctum.[3][8] It is one of the largest monolithic linga sculptures in India.[30]\\r\\nThe Shaivism temple celebrates all major Hindu traditions by including the primary deities of the Vaishnavism and Shaktism tradition in the great mandapa of the main temple. The distribution of the deities is generally symmetric, except for the east entrance side which provide for the door and walkway. In addition to the main deities, each side provides for dvarapalas (guardians), and various other sculptures. The vestibule has three stone sculptures that is intricately carved, and mural paintings.[35] The ground floor level sanctum walls have the following sculptures:[35]\\r\\nOn the second floor, Shiva's Tripurantakar form in different postures is depicted corresponding to these sculptures. Above these floors, the sri-vimana towers above in thirteen storeys (talas). Above these storeys is a single square block of granite weight eighty tons and 7.77 metres (25.5?ft) side. On top of this block, at its corners are Nandi pairs each about 1.98 metres (6?ft 6?in) by 1.68 metres (5?ft 6?in) in dimension. Above the center of this granite block rises the griva, the sikhara and the finial (stupi) of Tamil Hindu temple architecture. This stupi is 3.81 metres (12.5?ft) in height, and was originally covered with gold (no longer). The sikhara at the top is cupola-shaped and weighs 25 tons.[35] Each storey of this tower is decorated with kutas and salas. The shrinking squares tower architecture of this temple differs from the tower at the Chola temple at Gangaikondasolisvaram, because this is straight in contrast to the latter which is curvilinear. The temple's sri-vimana magnitude has made it a towering landmark for the city.[35]\\r\\nThe upper storey corridor wall of the aditala is carved with 81 of the 108 dance karanas ÿ postures of Natya Sastra. This text is the basis of the Bharathanatyam, the classical dance of Tamil Nadu. The 27 unrepresented karanas are blank blocks of stone, and it is unclear why these were not carved. The 81 postures carved suggest the significance of this classical Indian dance form by early 11th century.[8]\\r\\nThe garbhagriha is square and sits on a plinth. This is moulded and 0.5 metres (1?ft 8?in) thick. It consists of upapitham and adhishthanam, respectively 140 cm and 360 cm think.[8]\\r\\nThe two mandapa, namely maha-mandapa and mukha-mandapa, are square plan structures axially aligned between the sanctum and the Nandi mandapa. The maha-mandapa has six pillars on each side.[37] This too has artwork. The Vitankar and Rajaraja I bronze are here, but these were added much later. The maha-mandapa is flanked by two giant stone dvarapalas. It is linked to the mukha-mandapa by stairs. The entrance of the mukha-mandapa also has dvarapalas. With the mandapa are eight small shrines for dikpalas, or guardian deities of each direction such as Agni, Indra, Varuna, Kubera and others. These were installed during the rule of Chola king Rajendra I.[37]\\r\\nInscriptions indicate that this area also had other iconography from major Hindu traditions during the Chola era, but these are now missing. The original eight shrines included those for Surya (sun god), Saptamatrikas (seven mothers), Ganapati, Subrahmanyar, Jyeshtha Devi, Chandra, Chandesvarar and Bhairavar.[37] Similarly, in the western wall cella was a massive granite Ganesha built during Rajaraja I era, but who is now found in the tiruch-churru-maligai (southern veranda). Of the Shaktism tradition's seven mothers, only Varahi survives in a broken form. Her remnants are now found in a small modern era brick \\"Varahi shrine\\" in the southern side of the courtyard. The original version of the others along with their original Chola shrines are missing.[37]\\r\\nThe temple has an underneath layer of Chola frescoes on the sanctum walls along the circumambulatory pathway. These frescoes which cover floor to ceiling, were discovered in 1931 by S. K. Govindasami of the Anamalai University.[38] The painters used natural pigments and infused it into the wet limestone layer as it was setting in. The Chola frescoes were largely of Shaivism themes. These were restored in the 2000s.[39] The total Chola fresco area is about 670 square metres (7,200?sq?ft), of which about 112 square metres (1,210?sq?ft) had been uncovered as of 2010 in a method that preserves both paintings, a technique developed by Archaeological Survey of India.[38] The frescoes narrate Hindu mythology.[38][40] According to Balasubrahmanyam, most frescoes are related to Shiva, but the 11th century Chola frescoes also show Vishnu, Durga and others, as well as scenes of Chola royalty, courtly and common life.[40]\\r\\nThe later constructions, additions and modifications to the temple curtailed the amount of natural light inside the temple. The frescoes were thus photographed in a limited way and interpreted. According to Sriraman, a complete imaging with better photographic equipment suggests that these historic interpretations were incorrect.[38] For example, a fresco that was previously interpreted as Dakshinamurti Shiva is actually a secular scene of a royal guru meditating under a banyan tree. On the tree are shown peacocks, birds, monkeys, squirrels and owls, plus a cobra. The animals and birds are shown as worried of the cobra, the one's closer to the snake are shown to be more worried.[38] Other parts of the panel similarly show a court listening to a saint. Other show women in different dresses in different dance mudra.[38]\\r\\nSome of the paintings in the sanctum sanctorum and the walls in the passage had been damaged because of the soot that had deposited on them once upon a time. Owing to the continuous exposure to smoke and soot from the lamps and burning of camphor in the sanctum sanctorum over a period of centuries certain parts of the Chola paintings on the circumambulatory passage walls had been badly damaged.[39] The Archaeological Survey of India, for the first time in the world, used its unique de-stucco process to restore 16 Nayak paintings, which were superimposed on 1000-year-old Chola frescoes.[39] These 400-year-old paintings have been mounted on fibre glass boards, displayed at a separate pavilion.[39]\\r\\nThe temple walls have numerous inscriptions in Tamil and Grantha scripts. Many of these begin with customary Sanskrit and Tamil language historical introduction to the king who authorized it, and predominant number of them discuss gifts to the temple or temple personnel, in some cases residents of the city.[41][42]\\r\\nAn inscription on the north wall of enclosure, dated 1011 CE, gives a detailed accounts of people employed and supported by the temple. The inscription gives their wages, roles and names. It includes over 600 names including those of priests, lamp lighters, washermen, tailors, jewelers, potters, carpenters, sacred parasol bearers, dance gurus, dancing girls, singers, male and female musicians, superintendents of performance artists, accountants among others. Their wages was in parcels of land, so their temple employment was likely part time.[43][42]\\r\\nThe temple employed devadasis who were dancers and singers of devotional hymns. Among its numerous inscriptions are frequent gifts that state, \\"to provide for worship, for food to assembly of sannyasis (monks or ascetics) and for repairs\\". According to George Michell, the Thanjavur temple was a major charity institution in its history. It provides free meal for pilgrims, devotees and wayfarers on a daily basis. On days of Hindu festivals, these meals were elaborate and when brahmins were particularly invited and fed.[43][42]\\r\\nBuilt in the year 1010 CE by Raja Raja Chola in Thanjavur, the temple popularly known as the Big Temple. It turned 1000 years old in September 2010. To celebrate the 1000th year of the grand structure, the state government and the town held many cultural events. It was to recall the 275th day of his 25th regal year (1010 CE) when Raja Raja Chola (985ÿ1014 CE) handed over a gold-plated kalasam (copper pot or finial) for the final consecration to crown the vimana, the 59.82-metre tall tower above the sanctum.[44][45][46]\\r\\nTo mark the occasion, the state government organised a Bharathanatyam Yajna, classical dance show under noted dancer Padma Subramaniam. It was jointly organised by the Association of Bharatanatyam Artistes of India (ABHAI) and the Brhan Natyanjali Trust, Thanjavur. To mark the 1000th year anniversary of the building, 1000 dancers from New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Singapore, Malaysia and the US danced in concert to the recorded 11 verses of divine music Thiruvichaippa (ninth of Thirumurai) composed by Karuvur Thevar (the guru of Raja Raja Chola) named Tiruvisaippa. The small town turned into a cultural hub for two days beginning 26 September 2010 as street performers and dancers performed throughout the town.[47][48]\\r\\nOn 26 September 2010 (Big Temple's fifth day of millennium celebrations), as a recognition of Big Temple's contribution to the country's cultural, architectural, epigraphical history, a special ? 5 postage stamp featuring the 216-feet tall giant Raja Gopuram was released by India Post.\\r\\nThe Reserve Bank of India commemorated the event by releasing a ? 5 coin with the model of temple embossed on it.[49][50] A Raja, Cabinet Minister of Communications and Information Technology released the esteemed Brihadeeswarar temple special stamp, the first of which was received by G K Vasan, Cabinet Minister of Shipping.\\r\\nMumbai Mint issued Rs 1000 Commemorative Coin with the same picture as on the Rs 5 coin. It was the first 1000 Rupees coin to be released in the Republic of India coinage. This coin was a Non Circulative Legal Tender (NCLT).[51]\\r\\nOn 1 April 1954, the Reserve Bank of India released a ? 1000 currency note featuring a panoramic view of the Brihadeeswar temple marking its cultural heritage and significance. In 1975, the then government led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi demonetised all ? 1,000 currency notes in an effort to curtail black money. These notes are now popular among collectors.[52]\\r\\nIn 2010, the then Tamil Nadu chief minister, M Karunanidhi renamed Semmai Paddy, a type of high productivity paddy variant, as Raja Rajan-1000 to mark the millennial year of the constructor of the temple, Raja Raja Cholan.[53]\\r\\nThe temple \\"testifies the brilliant achievements of the Chola in architecture, sculpture, painting and bronze casting.\\"[54] The temple finds mention in many of the contemporary works of the period like Muvar Ula and Kalingathuparani. According to Chatterjee, the Dravidian architecture attained its supreme form of expression in the temple and it successor, the Brihadeeswarar Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram.[55] The temple has been declared as a heritage monument by the Government of India and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu.[10]\\r\\nThe temple was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with the Brihadeeswara Temple at Gangaikondacholapuram and Airavatesvara temple at Darasuram that are referred as the Great Living Chola Temples.[5] These three temples have similarities, but each has unique design and sculptural elements.[56] All of the three temples were built by the Cholas between the 10th and 12th centuries CE and they have continued to be supported and used by Hindus. The temples are classified as \\"Great Living\\" as the temples are active in cultural, pilgrimage and worship practises in modern times.[57]\\r\\nThe Brihadishvara temple at Thanjavur is the site of annual dance festivals around February, around the Mahashivratri. Major classical Indian dance form artists, as well as regional teams, perform their repertoire at this Brahan Natyanjali festival over 10 days.[58]\\r\\nThe Temple car was rolled out on its trial run from opposite to Sri Ramar temple on 20 April 2015 witnessed by a large number of people.[59] Nine days later, the maiden procession of the temple car was held. This was the first such procession in this temple held in the past hundred years, according to news reports.[60]\\r\\nKalki Krishnamurthy, a renowned Tamil novelist, has written a historical novel named Ponniyin Selvan, based on the life of Raja Raja Chola I.[61] Balakumaran, another Tamil author has written a novel named Udaiyar themed on the life of Raja Raja Chola I and the construction of the temple.[62]\\r\\nShiva as a saddhu (monk, Bhikshatana)\\r\\nArdhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati)\\r\\nGanesha\\r\\nKartikeya\\r\\nGanesha shrine with corridor in the back\\r\\nSubrahmanyar shrine in the north part of the courtyard\\r\\nChandeshvara shrine.

New York City was home to nearly 8.5 million people in 2014,[3] accounting for over 40% of the population of New York State and a slightly lower percentage of the New York metropolitan area, home to approximately 23.6 million. Over the last decade the city has been growing faster than the region. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States.[4][5][6][7]\\r\\nThroughout its history, New York City has been a major point of entry for immigrants; the term \\"melting pot\\" was coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[8][9][10] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[9][11][12] English remains the most widely spoken language, although there are areas in the outer boroughs in which up to 25% of people speak English as an alternate language, and/or have limited or no English language fluency. English is least spoken in neighborhoods such as Flushing, Sunset Park, and Corona.\\r\\nNew York City is the most populous city in the United States, with an estimated 8,491,079 people living in the city, according to U.S. Census estimates dating July 1, 2014[16] (up from 8,175,133 in 2010; 8.0 million in 2000; and 7.3 million in 1990).[15] This amounts to about 40% of New York State's population and a similar percentage of the metropolitan regional population. New York's two key demographic features are its population density and cultural diversity. The city's population density of 26,403 people per square mile (10,194/km2), makes it the densest of any American municipality with a population above 100,000.[17] Manhattan's population density is 66,940 people per square mile (25,846/km2), highest of any county in the United States.[18][19]\\r\\nNew York City is multicultural. About 36% of the city's population is foreign-born,[20] one of the highest among US cities. The eleven nations constituting the largest sources of modern immigration to New York City are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Guyana, Mexico, Ecuador, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Russia and El Salvador.[21]\\r\\nThe New York City metropolitan area is home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel.[22] It is also home to nearly a quarter of the nation's Indian Americans and 15% of all Korean Americans[23][24] and the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest African American community of any city in the country; and including 6 Chinatowns in the city proper,[25] comprised as of 2008 a population of 659,596 overseas Chinese,[26] the largest outside of Asia. New York City alone, according to the 2010 Census, has now become home to more than one million Asian Americans, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles.[27] New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper.[28] 6.0% of New York City is of Chinese ethnicity, with about forty percent of them living in the borough of Queens alone. Koreans make up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese at 0.3%. Filipinos are the largest southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese who make up only 0.2% of New York City's population. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, and Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.[29]\\r\\nThe largest ethnic groups as of the 2005 census estimates are: African American, African or Caribbean, Puerto Ricans, Italians, West Indians, Dominicans, Chinese, Irish, Russian, and German.[30][31] The Puerto Rican population of New York City is the largest outside Puerto Rico.[32] Italians emigrated to the city in large numbers in the early 20th century, establishing several \\"Little Italies\\". The Irish also have a notable presence, along with Germans.\\r\\nNew York City has a high degree of income variation. In 2005 the median household income in the highest census tract was reported to be $188,697, while in the lowest it was $9,320.[33] The variance is driven by wage growth in high income brackets, while wages have stagnated for middle and lower income brackets. In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest and fastest growing among the largest counties in the United States.[34] The borough is also experiencing a \\"baby boom\\" among the wealthy that is unique among U.S. cities. Since 2000, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan has grown by more than 32%.[35]\\r\\nIn 2000, about 3 out of every 10 New York City housing units were owner-occupied, compared to about 2 owner-occupied units out of every 3 units in the U.S. as a whole.[36] Rental vacancy is usually between 3% and 4.5%, well below the 5% threshold defined to be a housing emergency, justifying the continuation of rent control and rent stabilization. About 33% of rental units fall under rent stabilization, according to which increases are adjudicated periodically by city agencies. Rent control covers only a very small number of rental units.[37] Some critics point to New York City's strict zoning and other regulations as partial causes for the housing shortage, but during the city's decline in population from the 1960s through the 1980s, a large number of apartment buildings suffered suspected arson fires or were abandoned by their owners. Once the population trend was reversed, with rising prospects for rentals and sales, new construction has resumed, but generally for purchasers in higher income brackets.\\r\\nNew York is the largest city in the United States, with the city proper's population more than double the next largest city, Los Angeles (or roughly equivalent to the combined populations of Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston, the United States' second, third, and fourth most populous cities respectively). Demographers estimate New York's population will reach between 9.4 and 9.7 million by 2030.[38] In 2000 the reported life expectancy of New Yorkers was above the national average. Life expectancy for females born in 2009 in New York City is 80.2 years and for males is 74.5 years.[39]\\r\\nNew York's two key demographic features are its density and diversity. The city has an extremely high population density of 26,403 people per square mile (10,194/km2), about 10,000 more people per square mile than the next densest large American city, San Francisco.[41] Manhattan's population density is 66,940 people per square mile (25,846/km2).[19]\\r\\nThe city has a long tradition of attracting international immigration and Americans seeking careers in certain sectors. As of 2006, New York City has ranked number one for seven consecutive years as the city most U.S. residents would most like to live in or near.[42]\\r\\nThroughout its history New York City has been a principal entry point for immigration to the United States. These immigrants often form ethnic enclaves, neighborhoods dominated by one ethnicity. The city experienced major immigration from Europe in the 19th century and another major wave in the early 20th century, being admitted into the United States of America primarily through Ellis Island. Since the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, and particularly since the 1980s, New York City has seen renewed rates of high immigration. Newer immigrants are from Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. 36% of the city's population is foreign-born.[20] Among U.S. cities, this proportion is higher only in Los Angeles and Miami.[19] In New York no single country or region of origin dominates. The eleven largest countries of origin are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Guyana, Mexico, Ecuador, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Russia and El Salvador.[43] Between 1990 and 2000 the city admitted 1,224,524 immigrants.[44] Demographers and city officials have observed that immigration to New York City has been slowing since 1997. This is mostly due to more and more immigrants choosing directly to locate to the city's suburbs and then commute to the city or work in many of its booming edge cities like Fort Lee, NJ, Hempstead, NY, Morristown, NJ, Stamford, CT, White Plains, NY and others. Despite the slowdown in immigration the city's overall immigrant population has continued to increase and in 2006 it numbered 3.038 million (37.0%) up from 2.871 million (35.9%) in 2000.[45][46] By 2013, the population of foreign-born individuals living in New York City had increased to 3.07 million, and as a percentage of total population, was the highest it had been in the past 100 years.[47]\\r\\nImmigrant Africans, Caribbeans, and African Americans make up 25.1% of New York City's population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 2,086,566 black people residing in New York City. Percentage wise, approximately two out of every five black residents of New York City resides in Brooklyn (primarily in the Central, Northern, and Eastern sections of the borough), one out of every five resides in Bronx (mainly in the borough's Northeastern, Southeastern and Southern sections) one out of every five resides in Queens (mainly in the borough's Southeastern area), with the remaining black residents residing in Manhattan (primarily in Harlem) and Staten Island (mainly the North Shore of the borough).\\r\\nNative Americans make up 0.4% of New York City's population. According to the survey, there were 29,569 Native Americans residing in New York City. Of 29,569 Native Americans, 2,075 were of the Cherokee tribal grouping. In addition, 213 were of the Navajo tribal grouping. Also, 42 people identified themselves as Chippewa, and 47 people identified themselves as Sioux. There is a number of Mohawks indigenous to the New York city area and/or Upstate New York, and many Mohawks arrived in the 1930s to work in the skyscraper building construction industry.[48][unreliable source?] And a few Lenape Indians indigenous to the New York city area still remain in the city, migrated from other rural parts to Manhattan.[49]\\r\\nAsian Americans make up 11.8% of New York City's population. According to the survey, there were 976,807 Asian Americans residing in New York City. Of 976,807 Asian Americans, 445,145 were of Chinese descent, representing 5.4% of the city's population. In addition, there were 226,888 Indian Americans residing in the city, representing 2.7% of the population. Approximately 103,660 people identified themselves as \\"Other Asian\\", a category that includes people of Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, and Pakistani descent. Individuals in this category represent 1.2% of the city's population. There were 88,162 Korean Americans residing in the city, representing 1.1% of the population. Other Asian American groups include those of Filipino (68,826, 0.8%), Japanese (26,096, 0.3%), and Vietnamese (18,030, 0.2%) descent.\\r\\nPacific Islander Americans make up 0.1% of New York City's population. According to the survey, there were 4,941 Pacific Islander Americans residing in New York City. Of 4,941 Pacific Islander Americans, 1,992 were Native Hawaiian. Approximately 904 were of Samoan descent, and 504 were of Guamanian descent. In addition, 1,541 were of other Pacific Islander ancestries.\\r\\nThere is a considerable Bulgarian population in New York. Bulgarians migrated in New York in the 1900s.[50]\\r\\nMultiracial Americans make up 2.1% of New York City's population. According to the survey, there were 177,643 multiracial Americans residing in New York City. People of black and white ancestry numbered at 37,124, making up 0.4% of the population. People of white and Asian ancestry numbered at 22,242, making up 0.3% of the population. People of white/Native American ancestry (10,762) and black/Native American ancestry (10,221) each made up 0.1% of the city's population. The term \\"Multiracial American\\", however, can be very misleading. For example, many people of Latin American background may have various racial ancestries. Furthermore, there are many Americans who have multiple racial ancestries who are not aware of it. Therefore, the actual numbers are likely much higher.\\r\\nHispanics and Latinos make up 27.5% of New York City's population. According to the American Community Survey, there were 2,287,905 Hispanic or Latino Americans residing in New York City. The Hispanic/Latino population is categorized with four groups, \\"Puerto Rican\\" (785,618 or 9.4%), \\"Mexican\\" (297,581 or 3.6%), \\"Cuban\\" (42,377 or 0.5%), and \\"Other Hispanic or Latino\\" (1,165,576 or 14.0%).[51]\\r\\nAccording to the 2006-2007 Center for Latin American, Caribbean & Latino Studies:[52]\\r\\nNote: This source contains all of the numerical information in the data above.\\r\\nWhite Americans make up 44.6% of New York City's population. According to the survey, there were 3,704,243 White Americans residing in New York City. White Americans of non-Hispanic origin make up 35.1% of the city's population. There are 2,918,976 non-Hispanic whites residing in the city. Much of New York City's European American population consists of individuals of Italian, Irish, German, Russian, Polish, English, and Greek ancestry.[53]\\r\\nAccording to the 2006ÿ2008 American Community Survey, the top ten White, European ancestries were the following:[54]\\r\\nOther smaller European ancestries include:\\r\\nAccording to a 2001 study by Claritas, four of the city's five boroughs ranked among the nation's twenty most diverse counties. Queens ranked 1st, Brooklyn 3rd, Manhattan 7th, and The Bronx 17th. In addition, Hudson County and Essex County, New Jersey, both of which are part of the New York Metropolitan Area, ranked 6th and 15th, respectively.[55]\\r\\nThe city has several demographically unique characteristics. Queens is the only large county in the United States where the median income among black households, about $52,000 a year, has surpassed that of whites.[56]\\r\\nThe New York City metropolitan area is home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel.[57] It is also home to nearly a quarter of the nation's Indian American population,[58] and the largest African American community of any city in the country. New York City, with about 800,000 Puerto Rican residents, has the largest Puerto Rican population outside of Puerto Rico. Another historically significant ethnic group are Italians, who emigrated to the city in large numbers in the early 20th century. New York City is home to the largest Italian American population in the United States. The Irish and Germans also have a notable presence.\\r\\nAmerican Indian, Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander make up 2.9% of the population of NYC, and have been included with \\"Other\\".\\r\\nThe 2000 census counted 2,021,588 households with a median income of $38,293. 30% of households had children under the age of 18, and 37% were married couples living together. 19% had a single female householder, and 39% were non-families. 32% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10% were single residents 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.59 persons, and the average family size was 3.32.\\r\\nThe age range was as follows: 24% were under the age of 18, 10% between 18 and 24, 33% between 25 and 44, 21% between 45 and 64, and 12% were 65 or older. The median age in New York City in 2000 was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 90 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86 males.\\r\\nThe borough of Manhattan is experiencing a \\"baby boom\\" that is unique among U.S. cities. Since 2000, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan has grown by more than 32%.[62] The increase is driven mostly by affluent white families with median household incomes over $300,000.\\r\\nOverall, nominal household income in New York City is characterized by large variations. This phenomenon is especially true of Manhattan, which in 2005 was home to the highest incomes U.S. census tract, with a household income of $188,697, as well as the lowest, where household income was $9,320.[63] The disparity is driven in part by wage growth in high income brackets. In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest among the largest counties in the United States.[34] Wages in Manhattan were the fastest growing among the nation's 10 largest counties.[34] Among young adults in New York who work full-time, women now earn more money than men  approximately $5,000 more in 2005.[64]\\r\\nNew York City's borough of Manhattan is the highest nominal income county in the United States. In particular, ZIP code 10021 on Manhattan's Upper East Side, with more than 100,000 inhabitants and a per capita income of over $90,000, has one of the largest concentrations of income in the United States. The other boroughs, especially Queens and Staten Island, have large middle-class populations.\\r\\nNew York City's per capita income in 2000 was $22,402; men and women had a median income of $37,435 and $32,949 respectively. 21.2% of the population and 18.5% of families had incomes below the federal poverty line; 30.0% of this group were under the age of 18 and 17.8% were 65 and older.\\r\\nThe New Yorker with the highest wealth and income is oil magnate David H. Koch whose net worth is an estimated $44 billion (Forbes, March 2013)[65] to $34 billion (Bloomberg, April 2013),[66] an increase of $3 to $5 billion a year since 2007, when his wealth was about $12 billion.[67] Of Forbes Magazine's 400 richest American billionaires, 70 live in New York City.[65] New York City's recent mayor, Michael Bloomberg, is himself one of the nation's richest men. As of 2009 New York has regained the number one spot as the city with most billionaires (55), after losing out to Moscow in 2008.\\r\\nChristianity (59%), particularly Catholicism (33%), was the most prevalently practiced religion in New York as of 2014,[68] followed by Judaism, with approximately 1.2 million Jews in New York City,[69][70] about 14% of the population.[71]Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and atheism are also prominent throughout New York City. In 2014, 24% self-identified with no organized religious affiliation.[68]\\r\\nNew York has ranked first in population among American cities since the first census in 1790. New York will maintain this position, although there are varying forecasts on how much the population will increase. The most realistic population projections from the Department of City Planning anticipate a 1.1 million increase by 2030, bringing the city's population total to 9.1 million.\\r\\nWhile the city's projected 2030 population will be a new high, only two boroughs, Staten Island and Queens have reached their population peak every year for the last 5 years. The study projects that by 2030, Queens will have 2.57 million people and Staten Island 552,000. Manhattan, with 1.83 million, Bronx with 1.46 million and Brooklyn with 2.72 million, will still be below their population peaks.[72]\\r\\nOn March 27, 2011, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the city would file a formal challenge to the Census results, as a result of alleged undercounting in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.[73] The mayor has asserted that the numbers for Queens and Brooklyn, the two most populous boroughs, are implausible.[74] According to the Census, they grew by only 0.1% and 1.6%, respectively, while the other boroughs grew by between 3% and 5%. In addition, the Mayor claims, the census showed improbably high amounts of vacant housing in vital neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights, Queens.\\r\\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, New York City had the largest population of self-defined Black residents of any U.S. city, with over 2,000,000 within the city's boundaries, although this number has decreased since 2000.[78] New York City had more Black people than did the entire state of California until the 1980 United States Census. The Black population consists of immigrants and their descendants from Africa and the Caribbean as well as native-born African-Americans. Many of the city's black residents live in Brooklyn and The Bronx. Several of the city's neighborhoods are historical birthplaces of urban Black culture in America, among them the Brooklyn neighborhood of BedfordÿStuyvesant and Manhattan's Harlem and various sections of Eastern Queens and The Bronx. Bedford-Stuyvesant is considered to have the highest concentration of Black residents in the United States. New York City has the largest population of Black immigrants (at 686,814) and descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean (especially from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Guyana, Belize, Grenada, and Haiti), and of sub-Saharan Africans. In a news item of April 3, 2006, however, the New York Times noted that for the first time since the American Civil War, the recorded African-American population was declining, because of emigration to other regions, a declining African-American birthrate in New York, and decreased immigration of Blacks from the Caribbean and Africa.[79]\\r\\nThe New York City Metropolitan Area contains the largest ethnic Chinese population outside Asia, enumerating an estimated 735,019 individuals as of 2012,[80] including at least 9 Chinatowns, comprising the original Manhattan Chinatown, one in Queens (the Flushing Chinatown, three in Brooklyn (the Sunset Park Chinatown, the Avenue U Chinatown, and the Bensonhurst Chinatown), and one each in Edison, New Jersey and Nassau County, Long Island,[81] not to mention fledgling ethnic Chinese enclaves emerging throughout the New York City metropolitan area.[82]\\r\\nNew York City was home to an estimated 82,313 Filipinos in 2011, representing a 7.7% increase from the estimated 77,191 in 2008, with 56%, or about 46,000, in Queens.[83] Immigration from the Philippines began mainly after 1965, when immigration quotas that prevented Filipino immigration for many years were abolished. While there was earlier immigration from the Philippines, it was in low numbers and mainly concentrated in Hawaii and California. Since then, Filipinos have settled in Northeastern cities, with a majority in the New York City metropolitan area. Most of these immigrants have been professionals (doctors, nurses, other medical professions, accountants and engineers). The Filipino median household income in New York City was $81,929 in 2013, and 68% held a bachelor's degree or higher.[83]\\r\\nNew York City annually hosts the Philippine Independence Day Parade, which is traditionally held on the first Sunday of June at Madison Avenue. The celebration occupies nearly twenty-seven city blocks which includes a 3.5-hour parade and an all-day long street fair and cultural performances.\\r\\nA \\"Little Manila\\" can be found in Woodside, in the borough of Queens.[84] Filipinos are also concentrated in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst in Queens.[85] There are also smaller Filipino communities in Jamaica, Queens and parts of Brooklyn. The Benigno Aquino Triangle is located on Hillside Avenue in Hollis, Queens to commemorate the slain Filipino political leader and to recognize the large Filipino American population in the area.[86]\\r\\nAlthough not technically part of New York City, other large Filipino populations just outside the city's borders can be found in neighboring Northern and Central New Jersey, particularly in Bergen, Hudson, Middlesex,[87] and Passaic counties. By 2013 Census estimates, the New York City metropolitan area was estimated to be home to 224,266 Filipino Americans, 88.5% (about 200,000) of them single-race Filipinos.[88] Over 150,000 Fipino-born immigrants made their home in the New York City tri-state metropolitan region in 2011.[89] In 2012, a Census-estimated 235,222 single- and multi-racial Filipino Americans lived in the broader New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area.[90]\\r\\nNew York City is home to 100,000 ethnic Koreans, with two-thirds living in Queens.[91] On the other hand, the overall Greater New York Combined Statistical Area[92] enumerated 218,764 Korean American residents as of the 2010 United States Census, the second-largest population of Koreans outside of Korea.[93]\\r\\nAccording to 2007 American Community Survey estimates, New York City is home to approximately 315,000 people from the Indian subcontinent, which includes the countries of India (236,117), Pakistan (39,002), Bangladesh (34,332), and Sri Lanka (5,010). South Asians constitute 3.8% of New York City's population.[94] The New York City Metropolitan Area is home to approximately 600,000 Indian Americans, representing the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere. A majority of the South Asian residents are concentrated in Queens neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights, Flushing, City Line, Ozone Park, Glen Oaks, Floral Park, Bellerose, Jamaica, Kew Gardens, and Elmhurst. In the borough of Queens, the South Asian population is approximately near 200,000 and counting, where they constitute 8.2% of the population. South Asians from the Caribbean majority from Guyana, Trinidad, and a small number from Jamaica are also large in number.\\r\\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, there are 192,209 Asian Indians, 53,174 Bangladeshis, 41,887 Pakistanis, and 3,696 Sri Lankans in New York City.[95]\\r\\nThe New York City Metropolitan Area contains the largest Sri Lankan community in the United States (second largest in North America after Toronto, Ontario, Canada), receiving the highest legal permanent resident Sri Lankan immigrant population.[96] The Little Sri Lanka in the Tompkinsville neighborhood of the borough of Staten Island is one of the largest Sri Lankan communities outside of the country of Sri Lanka itself.[97][98]\\r\\nAs of the 2000 United States Census about over half of the 37,279 people of Japanese ancestry in New York State lived in New York City.[99]\\r\\nArabs first emigrated to New York City in the 1880s, the vast majority of them came from modern-day Lebanon and Syria. Before the advent of modern Lebanon in August 1920, and due to the political and historical nature of Ottoman-ruled Syria, the majority of Lebanese and Syrians referred to themselves as \\"Syrian\\" upon arrival to Ellis Island.[100] Little by little, starting in the 1930s, immigrants from Lebanon started referring to themselves as \\"Lebanese-American\\" and immigrants from Syria retained the designation \\"Syrian-American\\". From 1880-1960 the overwhelming majority (90%) of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants were of the Christian faith.[101] After 1960, especially after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, Arab Muslims from other Arab countries and territories such as Palestine, Jordan, and Egypt started arriving in New York. The Syrian/Lebanese mother colony was located around Washington Street in Lower Manhattan, in a neighborhood called Little Syria.[102] Syrian immigration to the United States was very small with respect to the other ethnic groups or peoples that arrived in America. In 1910, at the peak of Syrian immigration, only 60,000 Syrians entered the United States.[100]\\r\\nAround the late-1930s, Little Syria started to go into decline with the construction of skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan. In the name of urban renewal, the skyscraper era was ushered in and preceded with the destruction of five-storey tenements that Syrians called home. The final blow to Little Syria commenced with the construction of the Brooklyn battery tunnel in 1940. A large percentage of the community moved to the area around downtown Brooklyn; and set up shops and businesses on Atlantic Avenue. St. George's Syrian Catholic Church is the last physical reminder of the Syrian- and Lebanese-American community that once lived in Little Syria.[100] In Brooklyn, there are two long-time established businesses still open on Atlantic Avenue. Damascus Bakery is still in business since 1936, and Sahadi's has had a strong loyal customer base since 1948. By the 1960s, the community was to move yet again this time to Park Slope and Bay Ridge.[103]\\r\\nThe New York metro area contains the largest concentration of populations with Arab and Middle Eastern ancestry in the United States, with 230,899 residents of the metro area claiming Arab ancestry in the 2000 U.S. Census.[104] An estimated 70,000 lived in New York City as of 2000.[105][106] New York City holds the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival, founded in 2003 by comedians Dean Obeidallah and Maysoon Zayid.\\r\\nCarl Schurz, a refugee from the unsuccessful first German democratic revolution of 1848, served as United States Secretary of the Interior and as United States Senator from Missouri. Carl Schurz Park in Manhattan is named after him.\\r\\nThe influence of German immigration can still be felt in areas of New York City. The Yorkville neighborhood on the Upper East Side of Manhattan was a center of German-American culture. As of the 2000 census 255,536 New Yorkers reported German ancestry.[107]\\r\\nIn the middle of the 19th century, Little Germany, situated in what is now termed Alphabet City, was the first non-English-speaking urban enclave in the United States.\\r\\nGreek immigration to New York City began mainly in the 1890s. The push factors for immigration were the Balkan Wars and World War I. Greek immigration to New York City took place between 1890 until around 1917. In the latter years more women arrived and communities began to grow, especially in Astoria, Queens. Greeks again began to arrive in large numbers after 1945, as they fled the economic devastation caused by World War II and the Greek Civil War.\\r\\nIn the first immigration wave, most of the Greek immigrants were men. Many of them worked in industrial labor jobs, and others created a niche in the fur business. This immigration wave brought 450,000 Greeks to the Northeast, largely concentrated in New York City. The second immigration wave taking place after 1945 and 1982, was smaller with a total of 211,000 immigrants, mostly within the Northeast. However, new immigrants helped revive assimilating Greek communities and added new energy to a sense of ethnic identity.\\r\\nThe largest concentration of Greeks can still be found in Astoria. The Greek community there was established in the early 20th century immigration. The neighborhood still has many Greek food stores and restaurants. Residents of Greek descent make up 1.0% of New York City's population.\\r\\nThe Irish community is one of New York's major ethnic groups and has been a significant proportion of the city's population since the waves of immigration in the mid-nineteenth century. New York City's St. Patrick's Day Parade dates to 1762.\\r\\nDuring the Great Irish Famine (1845ÿ1851), Irish families were forced to emigrate from Ireland; by 1854, between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 people were forced to leave the country - about a quarter of the pre-famine population. In the United States, most of the recently arrived Irish became city dwellers as that was where work was. In addition, arriving with little money, many settled in the cities at which their ships made port. By 1850, the Irish made up a quarter of the population in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Their arrival in the United States before other waves of Catholic immigrants meant that ethnic Irish long dominated the Roman Catholic Church in America. They created a strong network of churches and parochial schools to support their communities.\\r\\nThe Irish have long played a significant role in city politics, the Roman Catholic Church, and the New York City Fire Department and Police Department. As of the 2000 census, 520,810 New Yorkers reported Irish ancestry.[108]\\r\\nAccording to a 2006 genetic survey by Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, about one in fifty New Yorkers of European origin carry a distinctive genetic signature on their Y chromosomes inherited from Niall of the Nine Hostages, an Irish high king of the 5th century A.D.[109][110]\\r\\nNew York City has the largest population of Italian Americans in the United States of America as well as North America, many of whom inhabit ethnic enclaves in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. New York City is home to the third largest Italian population outside of Italy, behind Sao Paulo, Brazil and Buenos Aires, Argentina, respectively.\\r\\nThe largest wave of Italian immigration to the United States took place in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Between 1870 and 1978, 5.3 million Italians immigrated to the United States, including over two million between 1900 and 1910. Only the Irish and Germans immigrated in larger numbers. Italian families first settled in Little Italy's neighborhoods, the first and most famous one being the one around Mulberry Street, in Manhattan. This settlement, however, is rapidly becoming part of the adjacent Chinatown as the older Italian residents die and their children move elsewhere. As of the 2000 census, 692,739 New Yorkers reported Italian ancestry, making them the largest European ethnic group in the city.[111] In 2011, the American Community Survey found there were 49,075 persons of Italian birth in New York City.[112]\\r\\nPolish immigration to New York City began at the end of the 20th century. In the 1980s, as a result of the Polish government's crackdown on the burgeoning Solidarno?? labor and political movement, Polish migration to the U.S. swelled. Polish-Americans and Polish immigrants in the city generally reside in Brooklyn (neighborhoods of Greenpoint and Williamsburg) and in Queens (neighborhoods of Maspeth and Ridgewood). The combined neighborhood of Greenpoint/Williamsburg is sometimes referred to as \\"Little Poland\\" because of its large population of primarily working-class Polish immigrants, reportedly the second largest concentration in the United States, after Chicago. As of the 2000 census, 213,447 New Yorkers reported Polish ancestry.[113]\\r\\nNew York is home to a number of Polish and Polish-American cultural, community, and scientific institutions, including the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America (PIASA) and the Polish Cultural Institute. Polish-language publications with circulation reaching outside the city include The Polish Review, an English-language scholarly journal published since 1956 by PIASA; Nowy Dziennik [3], founded in 1971; and Polska Gazeta [4], founded in the year 2000. The Polska Gazeta is the leading Polish-language daily newspaper in the tri-state area, delivering daily news to over 17,000 readers in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Long Island and Delaware. The Polish Newspaper SuperExpress [5], covering New York, New Jersey & Connecticut started publication in 1996.\\r\\nThe Pulaski Day Parade in New York on Fifth Avenue has been celebrated since 1937 to commemorate Kazimierz Pu?aski, a Polish hero of the American Revolutionary War. It closely coincides with the October 11 General Pulaski Memorial Day, a national observance of his death at the Siege of Savannah, and his held on the first Sunday of October. In these parades march Polish dancers, Polish soccer teams and their mascots, Polish Scouts - ZHP and Polish school ambassadors and representatives, such as Mikolaj Pastorino (Nicholas Pastorino) and Lech Wa??sa. The Pulaski Day Parade is one of the largest parades in New York City.\\r\\nThe Romanian community of New York City is the largest such community in North America. The 2000 Census reported 161,900 Romanians were living in New York City. They are mainly concentrated in Queens, as well as in parts of Manhattan and Staten Island. The Romanian Day Festival, for which the City closes a section of Broadway, demonstrates the strong sense of community of Romanians living in New York.\\r\\nNew York City contains a very large and growing Russian-Jewish population estimated at around 300,000. There are large numbers of Russian-Jews in Brooklyn, mostly in neighborhoods of Southern Brooklyn, notably Brighton Beach, also known as \\"Little Odessa\\", where there are many businesses and billboards with signage entirely in the Russian language. There is a significant Russian Orthodox population in New York City as well.\\r\\nNew York City contains a large and growing Ukrainian population. New York's Ukrainian population was traditionally centered around the East Village in Manhattan, as well as Brighton Beach (also known as \\"Little Odessa\\"), in Brooklyn. Urban flight and recent waves of new immigration have spread Ukrainians throughout the boroughs, with a heavy concentration in Brooklyn.\\r\\nThe New York metropolitan area is home to the largest Jewish population in the world outside Israel. While most are descendants of Jews who moved from Europe, a growing number are of Asian and Middle Eastern origin. After dropping from a peak of 2.5 million in the 1950s to a low of 1.4 million in 2002 the population of Jews in the New York metropolitan area grew to 1.54 million in 2011. A study by the UJA-Federation of New York released in 2012[114] showed that the proportion of liberal Jews was decreasing while the proportion of generally conservative Orthodox Jews and recent immigrants from Russia was increasing. Much of this growth is in Brooklyn, which in 2012 was 23% Jewish and where most of the Russian immigrants live and nearly all of the ultra-orthodox.[115] The study by UJA-Federation of New York has been criticized by J.J. Goldberg, an observer at The Jewish Daily Forward, as excluding suburban Jews, for example in New Jersey, that are outside the service area of UJA-Federation of New York and also for lack of granularity with respect to the Orthodox of New York City.[116] The New York metropolitan area's Jewish population in 2001 was approximately 1.97 million, 600,000 fewer than in Israel's largest metropolitan area, denoted as Gush Dan. In 2012, an estimated 1,086,000 Ashkenazic Jews lived in New York City and constituted about 12% of the city's population, while approximately 100,000 Sephardic Jews live in the city too. New York City is also home to the world headquarters of the Hasidic Chabad-Lubavitch group and the Bobover, Pupa, Vizhnitz and Satmar branches of Hasidism, ultra-Orthodox sects of Judaism.[citation needed] Many notable Jews come from New York City.\\r\\nThe first Jewish presence in New York City dates to the arrival of 23 Jewish refugees in 1654, who fled from Recife, Brazil, after the Portuguese conquered New Holland and brought the Inquisition with them.[117] Major immigration of Jews to New York began in the 1880s, with the increase of Anti-Semitic actions in Central and Eastern Europe. The number of Jews in New York City soared throughout the beginning of the 20th century and reached a peak of 2 million in the 1950s, when Jews constituted one-quarter of the city's population. New York City's Jewish population then began to decline because of low fertility rates and migration to suburbs and other states, particularly California and Florida.\\r\\nA new wave of Ashkenazi, Kavkazi, Bukharian, and Georgian Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union began arriving in the 1980s and 1990s. Sephardic Jews including Syrian, Moroccan and other Jews of non-European origin have also lived in New York City since the 17th century. Many Jews, including the newer immigrants, have settled in Queens, south Brooklyn, and the Bronx, where at present most live in neighborhoods such as Riverdale.[citation needed] Sephardic Jews estimated at 100,000 strong have settled along Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn creating a unified community consisting of about 75,000 people in this area, while the other Sephardic Jews live in the Upper East Side of Manhattan and in Staten Island.\\r\\n19th-century Jewish immigrants settled mainly in the tenement houses of the Lower East Side of Manhattan. New York City's current Jewish population is dispersed among all the boroughs; Brooklyn's Jewish population in 2011 was estimated as 561,000, and Manhattan's was 240,000.[118]\\r\\nThe Orthodox community is rapidly growing due to higher birthrates among Orthodox (especially Hasidic) Jews, while the numbers of Conservative and Reform Jews are declining.[119] 60% of the Jewish children in New York are Orthodox, 37% Hasidic. This accelerating dynamic is accompanied by a substantial rise in the percentage of Jews who live in poverty.[115]\\r\\nLike the Irish and Italian, the Jewish community has played an important role in recent New York City politics; Jewish voters traditionally vote in large numbers and have often supported politically liberal policies. As the proportion of liberal Conservative and Reform Jews decreases and that of conservative Russian and Orthodox Jews increases in the 21st Century the political interests of New York Jews are changing. The Russian immigrants have shown a tendency to vote Republican while the ultra-orthodox are social conservatives who have a pressing need for supportive social services. There is little support among either group for the liberal community institutions which have been built by the liberal Jewish community. A significant portion of the rapidly growing Hasidic community is pro-Israel and supports the Israeli Settlement Movement.\\r\\nNew York City has the largest Puerto Rican population outside of Puerto Rico. Attributable to the changing citizenship status of the island's residents, Puerto Ricans, can technically be said to have come to the City first as immigrants and subsequently as migrants. The first group of Puerto Ricans moved to New York in the mid-19th century, when Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony and its people Spanish subjects. The following wave of Puerto Ricans to move to New York did so after the SpanishÿAmerican War of 1898 made Puerto Rico a U.S. possession and after the JonesÿShafroth Act of 1917 gave Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship, which allows travel without the need of a passport between the island and the United States mainland. The largest wave of migration came in the 1950s, in what became known as \\"The Great Migration\\"; as a result, more than a million Puerto Ricans once called New York City home. Presently the Puerto Rican population is around 800,000.\\r\\nPuerto Ricans have historically lived in neighborhoods such as the Lower East Side (also known in the community as Loisaida), Spanish Harlem and Williamsburg, Brooklyn since the 1950s. However, there has been an increase in Puerto Ricans in outlying areas of the city, such as the North Shore of Staten Island, and the eastern Bronx.\\r\\nImmigration records of Dominicans in the United States date from the late 19th century, and New York City has had a Dominican community since the 1930s. From the 1960s onward, after the fall of the Rafael Trujillo military regime, large waves of migration have thoroughly transnationalized the Dominican Republic, metaphorically blurring its frontier with the United States.\\r\\nIn 2006 New York City's Dominican population decreased for the first time since the 1980s, dropping by 1.3% from 609,885 in 2006 to 602,093 in 2007. They are the city's second-largest Hispanic group and, in 2009, it was estimated that they composed 24.9% of New York City's Latino population. According to Census data analysis by CUNYs Center for Latin American, Caribbean & Latino Studies, shows Dominicans as the new largest group of Hispanics in NYC. There were about 747,473 Dominicans in the five boroughs in 2013, compared with 719,444 Puerto Ricans.[120]\\r\\nAreas with high a concentration of Dominicans are in Washington Heights, Corona, and certain areas in the Bronx.\\r\\nAt the 2010 Census, there were 457,288 Mexican Americans living in New York City.[121] In 2009, it was estimated that of the city's Hispanic population, 13.5% was of Mexican origin.[120] Mexicans are the fastest growing group of Hispanic population.[78] Some estimates suggest that Mexicans will surpass both Puerto Ricans and Dominicans in 2023 to become the citys largest national Latino sub-group.[120] As of 2011, the Mexican Consulate estimated about 500,000 Mexicans lived in New York City, of whom 35,000 spoke a Mexican indigenous language.[122]\\r\\nIn 2009, it was estimated that 211,378 Ecuadorian Americans lived in New York City, representing 8.9% of the city's Hispanic population. They are the fourth largest sub-group of Hispanics, after Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and Mexicans.[120]\\r\\nColombians have come in small numbers to New York City since the 1950s. The major exodus of Colombians from Colombia came in the 1970s and early 1980s when many of Colombia's cities were facing hardships from drug traffickers, crime and lack of employment. 75% of Colombians in New York City live in Queens, specifically in Jackson Heights, Corona, Elmhurst and Murray Hill.[123]\\r\\nSince 1990, the Salvadoran population has been growing very rapidly in New York City. More than 50% of Salvadorans live in Queens, and the growth of their population is most notable in South Jamaica and Far Rockaway. Many Salvadorans reside in the Bronx as well. There are also pockets of Salvadorans in Brooklyn and in East Harlem, Manhattan.","input":"What is the largest ethnic group in new york city?"},{"output":"the 10th or 11th century","context":"The European colonization of the Americas describes the history of the settlement and establishment of control of the continents of the Americas by various European powers. Starting in either the 10th or 11th century, when West Norse sailors explored and briefly settled on the shores of present-day Canada, according to Icelandic Sagas, violent conflicts with the indigenous population ultimately led to the Norse abandoning those settlements.[1]\\r\\nEuropean colonization began in 1492, when a Spanish expedition headed by the Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus sailed west to find a new trade route to the Far East but inadvertently landed in what came to be known to Europeans as the \\"New World\\". Running aground on the northern part of Hispaniola on 5 December 1492, which the Taino people had inhabited since the 7th century, the site became the first European settlement in the Americas. European conquest, large-scale exploration and colonization soon followed. Columbus's first two voyages (1492ÿ93) reached the Bahamas and various Caribbean islands, including Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1498, sailing from Bristol on behalf of England, John Cabot landed on the North American coast, and a year later, Columbus's third voyage reached the South American coast. As the sponsor of Christopher Columbus's voyages, Spain was the first European power to settle and colonize the largest areas, from North America and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America.\\r\\nOther powers such as France also founded colonies in the Americas: in eastern North America, a number of Caribbean islands and small coastal parts of South America. Portugal colonized Brazil, tried colonizing the eastern coasts of present-day Canada and settled for extended periods northwest (on the east bank) of the River Plate. The Age of Exploration was the beginning of territorial expansion for several European countries. Europe had been preoccupied with internal wars and was slowly recovering from the loss of population caused by the Black Death; thus the rapid rate at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 15th century.[2]\\r\\nEventually, most of the Western Hemisphere came under the control of European governments, leading to changes to its landscape, population, and plant and animal life. In the 19th century over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas.[3] The post-1492 era is known as the period of the Columbian Exchange, a dramatically widespread exchange of animals, plants, culture, human populations (including slaves), ideas and communicable disease between the American and Afro-Eurasian hemispheres following Columbus's voyages to the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNorse journeys to Greenland and Canada are supported by historical and archaeological evidence.[4] A Norse colony in Greenland was established in the late 10th century, and lasted until the mid 15th century, with court and parliament assemblies (ting) taking place at Brattahle and a bishop located at Garear.[5] The remains of a Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, Canada, were discovered in 1960 and were dated to around the year 1000 (carbon dating estimate 990ÿ1050 CE).[6] L'Anse aux Meadows is the only site widely accepted as evidence of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. It was named a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1978.[7] It is also notable for its possible connection with the attempted colony of Vinland, established by Leif Erikson around the same period or, more broadly, with the West Norse colonization of the Americas.[8]\\r\\nEarly explorations and conquests were made by the Spanish and the Portuguese immediately following their own final reconquest of Iberia in 1492. In the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, ratified by the Pope, these two kingdoms divided the entire non-European world into two areas of exploration and colonization, with a north to south boundary that cut through the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern part of present-day Brazil. Based on this treaty and on early claims by Spanish explorer Vasco N~?ez de Balboa, discoverer of the Pacific Ocean in 1513, the Spanish conquered large territories in North, Central and South America.\\r\\nSpanish conquistador Hernn Corts took over the Aztec Kingdom and Francisco Pizarro conquered the Inca Empire. As a result, by the mid-16th century, the Spanish Crown had gained control of much of western South America, Central America and southern North America, in addition to its earlier Caribbean territories. Over this same timeframe, Portugal claimed lands in North America (Canada) and colonized much of eastern South America, naming it Santa Cruz and Brazil.\\r\\nOther European nations soon disputed the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas. England and France attempted to plant colonies in the Americas in the 16th century, but these failed. England and France succeeded in establishing permanent colonies in the following century, along with the Dutch Republic. Some of these were on Caribbean islands, which had often already been conquered by the Spanish or depopulated by disease, while others were in eastern North America, which had not been colonized by Spain north of Florida.\\r\\nEarly European possessions in North America included Spanish Florida, Spanish New Mexico, the English colonies of Virginia (with its North Atlantic offshoot, Bermuda) and New England, the French colonies of Acadia and Canada, the Swedish colony of New Sweden, and the Dutch New Netherland. In the 18th century, DenmarkÿNorway revived its former colonies in Greenland, while the Russian Empire gained a foothold in Alaska. Denmark-Norway would later make several claims in the Caribbean, starting in the 1600s.\\r\\nAs more nations gained an interest in the colonization of the Americas, competition for territory became increasingly fierce. Colonists often faced the threat of attacks from neighboring colonies, as well as from indigenous tribes and pirates.\\r\\nThe first phase of well-financed European activity in the Americas began with the Atlantic Ocean crossings of Christopher Columbus (1492ÿ1504), sponsored by Spain, whose original attempt was to find a new route to India and China, known as \\"the Indies\\". He was followed by other explorers such as John Cabot, who was sponsored by England and reached Newfoundland. Pedro lvares Cabral reached Brazil and claimed it for Portugal.\\r\\nAmerigo Vespucci, working for Portugal in voyages from 1497 to 1513, established that Columbus had reached a new set of continents. Cartographers still use a Latinized version of his first name, America, for the two continents. Other explorers included Giovanni da Verrazzano, sponsored by France in 1524; the Portuguese Jo?o Vaz Corte-Real in Newfoundland; Jo?o Fernandes Lavrador, Gaspar and Miguel Corte-Real and Jo?o lvares Fagundes, in Newfoundland, Greenland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia (from 1498 to 1502, and in 1520); Jacques Cartier (1491ÿ1557), Henry Hudson (1560sÿ1611), and Samuel de Champlain (1567ÿ1635), who explored the region of Canada he reestablished as New France.\\r\\nIn 1513, Vasco N~?ez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and led the first European expedition to see the Pacific Ocean from the west coast of the New World. In an action with enduring historical import, Balboa claimed the Pacific Ocean and all the lands adjoining it for the Spanish Crown. It was 1517 before another expedition, from Cuba, visited Central America, landing on the coast of Yucatn in search of slaves.\\r\\nThese explorations were followed, notably in the case of Spain, by a phase of conquest: The Spaniards, having just finished the Reconquista of Spain from Muslim rule, were the first to colonize the Americas, applying the same model of governing their European holdings to their territories of the New World.\\r\\nTen years after Columbus's discovery, the administration of Hispaniola was given to Nicols de Ovando of the Order of Alcntara, founded during the Reconquista. As in the Iberian Peninsula, the inhabitants of Hispaniola were given new landmasters, while religious orders handled the local administration. Progressively the encomienda system, which granted tribute (access to indigenous labor and taxation) to European settlers, was set in place.\\r\\nA relatively common misconception is that a small number of conquistadores conquered vast territories, aided only by disease epidemics and their powerful caballeros. In fact, recent archaeological excavations have suggested a vast Spanish-Indian alliance numbering in the hundreds of thousands.[9] Hernn Corts eventually conquered Mexico with the help of Tlaxcala in 1519ÿ1521, while the conquest of the Incas was carried out by some 40,000 Incan renegades led by Francisco Pizarro in between 1532 and 1535.\\r\\nOver the 1st century and a half after Columbus's voyages, the native population of the Americas plummeted by an estimated 80% (from around 50 million in 1492 to eight million in 1650[10]), mostly by outbreaks of Old World diseases.\\r\\nIn 1532, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor sent a vice-king to Mexico, Antonio de Mendoza, in order to prevent Cortes' independentist drives, who definitively returned to Spain in 1540. Two years later, Charles V signed the New Laws (which replaced the Laws of Burgos of 1512) prohibiting slavery and the repartimientos, but also claiming as his own all the American lands and all of the indigenous people as his own subjects.\\r\\nWhen in May 1493, the Pope Alexander VI issued the Inter caetera bull granting the new lands to the Kingdom of Spain, he requested in exchange an evangelization of the people. Thus, during Columbus's second voyage, Benedictine friars accompanied him, along with twelve other priests. As slavery was prohibited between Christians, and could only be imposed in non-Christian prisoners of war or on men already sold as slaves, the debate on Christianization was particularly acute during the 16th century. In 1537, the papal bull Sublimis Deus definitively recognized that Native Americans possessed souls, thus prohibiting their enslavement, without putting an end to the debate. Some claimed that a native who had rebelled and then been captured could be enslaved nonetheless.\\r\\nLater, the Valladolid debate between the Dominican priest Bartolom de Las Casas and another Dominican philosopher Juan Gins de Sep~lveda was held, with the former arguing that Native Americans were beings doted with souls, as all other human beings, while the latter argued to the contrary and justified their enslavement.\\r\\nThe process of Christianization was at first violent: when the first Franciscans arrived in Mexico in 1524, they burned the places dedicated to pagan cult, alienating much of the local population.[11] In the 1530s, they began to adapt Christian practices to local customs, including the building of new churches on the sites of ancient places of worship, leading to a mix of Old World Christianity with local religions.[11] The Spanish Roman Catholic Church, needing the natives' labor and cooperation, evangelized in Quechua, Nahuatl, Guaran and other Native American languages, contributing to the expansion of these indigenous languages and equipping some of them with writing systems. One of the first primitive schools for Native Americans was founded by Fray Pedro de Gante in 1523.\\r\\nTo reward their troops, the Conquistadores often allotted Indian towns to their troops and officers. Black African slaves were introduced to substitute for Native American labor in some locationsincluding the West Indies, where the indigenous population was nearing extinction on many islands.\\r\\nDuring this time, the Portuguese gradually switched from an initial plan of establishing trading posts to extensive colonization of what is now Brazil. They imported millions of slaves to run their plantations. The Portuguese and Spanish royal governments expected to rule these settlements and collect at least 20% of all treasure found (the quinto real collected by the Casa de Contrataci܇n), in addition to collecting all the taxes they could. By the late 16th century American silver accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget.[12] In the 16th century perhaps 240,000 Europeans entered American ports.[13][14]\\r\\nInspired by the Spanish riches from colonies founded upon the conquest of the Aztecs, Incas, and other large Native American populations in the 16th century, the first Englishmen to settle permanently in America hoped for some of the same rich discoveries when they established their first permanent settlement in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. They were sponsored by common stock companies such as the chartered Virginia Company financed by wealthy Englishmen who exaggerated the economic potential of this new land. The main purpose of this colony was the hope of finding gold.[2]\\r\\nIt took strong leaders, like John Smith, to convince the colonists of Jamestown that searching for gold was not taking care of their immediate needs for food and shelter and the biblical principle that \\"he who will not work shall not eat\\" (see 2 Thessalonians 3). The lack of food security leading to extremely high mortality rate was quite distressing and cause for despair among the colonists. To support the Colony, numerous supply missions were organized. Tobacco later became a cash crop, with the work of John Rolfe and others, for export and the sustaining economic driver of Virginia and the neighboring colony of Maryland.\\r\\nFrom the beginning of Virginia's settlements in 1587 until the 1680s, the main source of labor and a large portion of the immigrants were indentured servants looking for new life in the overseas colonies. During the 17th century, indentured servants constituted three-quarters of all European immigrants to the Chesapeake region. Most of the indentured servants were teenagers from England with poor economic prospects at home. Their fathers signed the papers that gave them free passage to America and an unpaid job until they became of age. They were given food, clothing, housing and taught farming or household skills. American landowners were in need of laborers and were willing to pay for a laborers passage to America if they served them for several years. By selling passage for five to seven years worth of work they could then start out on their own in America.[15] Many of the migrants from England died in the first few years.[2]\\r\\nEconomic advantage also prompted the Darien Scheme, an ill-fated venture by the Kingdom of Scotland to settle the Isthmus of Panama in the late 1690s. The Darien Scheme aimed to control trade through that part of the world and thereby promote Scotland into a world trading power. However, it was doomed by poor planning, short provisions, weak leadership, lack of demand for trade goods, and devastating disease.[16] The failure of the Darien Scheme was one of the factors that led the Kingdom of Scotland into the Act of Union 1707 with the Kingdom of England creating the united Kingdom of Great Britain and giving Scotland commercial access to English, now British, colonies.[17]\\r\\nIn the French colonial regions, the focus of economy was on sugar plantations in Caribbean. In Canada the fur trade with the natives was important. About 16,000 French men and women became colonizers. The great majority became subsistence farmers along the St. Lawrence River. With a favorable disease environment and plenty of land and food, their numbers grew exponentially to 65,000 by 1760. Their colony was taken over by Britain in 1760, but social, religious, legal, cultural and economic changes were few in a society that clung tightly to its recently formed traditions.[18][19]\\r\\nRoman Catholics were the first major religious group to immigrate to the New World, as settlers in the colonies of Portugal and Spain (and later, France) belonged to that faith. English and Dutch colonies, on the other hand, tended to be more religiously diverse. Settlers to these colonies included Anglicans, Dutch Calvinists, English Puritans and other nonconformists, English Catholics, Scottish Presbyterians, French Huguenots, German and Swedish Lutherans, as well as Quakers, Mennonites, Amish, Moravians and Jews of various nationalities.\\r\\nMany groups of colonists went to the Americas searching for the right to practice their religion without persecution. The Protestant Reformation of the 16th century broke the unity of Western Christendom and led to the formation of numerous new religious sects, which often faced persecution by governmental authorities. In England, many people came to question the organization of the Church of England by the end of the 16th century. One of the primary manifestations of this was the Puritan movement, which sought to \\"purify\\" the existing Church of England of its many residual Catholic rites that they believed had no mention in the Bible.\\r\\nA strong believer in the notion of rule by divine right, Charles I, King of England and Scotland, persecuted religious dissenters. Waves of repression led to the migration of about 20,000 Puritans to New England between 1629 and 1642, where they founded multiple colonies. Later in the century, the new Pennsylvania colony was given to William Penn in settlement of a debt the king owed his father. Its government was set up by William Penn in about 1682 to become primarily a refuge for persecuted English Quakers; but others were welcomed. Baptists, Quakers, German and Swiss Protestants and Anabaptists flocked to Pennsylvania. The lure of cheap land, religious freedom and the right to improve themselves with their own hand was very attractive.[20]\\r\\nSlavery was a common practice in the Americas prior to the arrival of Europeans, as different American Indian groups captured and held other tribes' members as slaves.[21] Many of these captives were forced to undergo human sacrifice in Amerindian civilizations such as the Aztecs. In response to some enslavement of natives in the Caribbean during the early years, the Spanish Crown passed a series of laws prohibiting slavery as early as 1512. A new stricter set of laws was passed in 1542, called the New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of Indians, or simply New Laws. These were created to prevent the exploitation of the indigenous peoples by the encomenderos or landowners, by strictly limiting their power and dominion.[22] This helped curb Indian slavery considerably, though not completely. Later, with the arrival of other European colonial powers in the New World, the enslavement of native populations increased, as these empires lacked legislation against slavery until decades later. The population of indigenous peoples declined (mostly from European diseases, but also from forced exploitation and atrocities). Later, native workers were replaced by Africans imported through a large commercial slave trade.\\r\\nBy the 18th century, the overwhelming number of black slaves was such that Amerindian slavery was less commonly used. Africans, who were taken aboard slave ships to the Americas, were primarily obtained from their African homelands by coastal tribes who captured and sold them. Europeans traded for slaves with the slave capturers of the local native African tribes in exchange for rum, guns, gunpowder, and other manufactures.\\r\\nThe total slave trade to islands in the Caribbean, Brazil, Mexico and to the United States is estimated to have involved 12 million Africans.[23][24] The vast majority of these slaves went to sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil, where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished. At most about 600,000 African slaves were imported into the U.S., or 5% of the 12 million slaves brought across from Africa.[25] Life expectancy was much higher in the U.S. (because of better food, less disease, lighter work loads, and better medical care) so the numbers grew rapidly by excesses of births over deaths, reaching 4 million by the 1860 Census. From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that of England.[26]\\r\\nSlaves imported to the Thirteen colonies/United States by time period:[27]\\r\\nThe European lifestyle included a long history of sharing close quarters with domesticated animals such as cows, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, and various domesticated fowl, from which many diseases originally stemmed. Thus, in contrast to the indigenous people, Europeans had developed a richer endowment of antibodies.[29] The large-scale contact with Europeans after 1492 introduced novel germs to the indigenous people of the Americas.\\r\\nEpidemics of smallpox (1518, 1521, 1525, 1558, 1589), typhus (1546), influenza (1558), diphtheria (1614) and measles (1618) swept the Americas subsequent to European contact,[30][31] killing between 10 million and 100 million[32] people, up to 95% of the indigenous population of the Americas.[33] The cultural and political instability attending these losses appears to have been of substantial aid in the efforts of various colonists in New England and Massachusetts to acquire control over the great wealth in land and resources of which indigenous societies had customarily made use.[34]\\r\\nSuch diseases yielded human mortality of an unquestionably enormous gravity and scale ÿ and this has profoundly confused efforts to determine its full extent with any true precision. Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas vary tremendously.\\r\\nOthers have argued that significant variations in population size over pre-Columbian history are reason to view higher-end estimates with caution. Such estimates may reflect historical population maxima, while indigenous populations may have been at a level somewhat below these maxima or in a moment of decline in the period just prior to contact with Europeans. Indigenous populations hit their ultimate lows in most areas of the Americas in the early 20th century; in a number of cases, growth has returned.[35]\\r\\nGeographic differences between the colonies played a large determinant in the types of political and economic systems that later developed. In their paper on institutions and long-run growth, economists Daron Acemo?lu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson argue that certain natural endowments gave rise to distinct colonial policies promoting either smallholder or coerced labor production.[36] Densely settled populations, for example, were more easily exploitable and profitable as slave labor. In these regions, landowning elites were economically incentivized to develop forced labor arrangements such as the Peru mit'a system or Argentinian latifundias without regard for democratic norms. French and British colonial leaders, conversely, were incentivized to develop capitalist markets, property rights, and democratic institutions in response to natural environments that supported smallholder production over forced labor.\\r\\nJames Mahoney, a professor at Northwestern University, proposes that colonial policy choices made at critical junctures regarding land ownership in coffee-rich Central America fostered enduring path dependent institutions.[37] Coffee economies in Guatemala and El Salvador, for example, were centralized around large plantations that operated under coercive labor systems. By the 19th century, their political structures were largely authoritarian and militarized. In Colombia and Costa Rica, conversely, liberal reforms were enacted at critical junctures to expand commercial agriculture, and they ultimately raised the bargaining power of the middle class. Both nations eventually developed more democratic and egalitarian institutions than their highly concentrated landowning counterparts.\\r\\nIn 2007, the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History and the Virginia Historical Society (VHS) co-organized a traveling exhibition to recount the strategic alliances and violent conflict between European empires (English, Spanish, French) and the Native people living in North America. The exhibition was presented in three languages and with multiple perspectives. Artifacts on display included rare surviving Native and European artifacts, maps, documents, and ceremonial objects from museums and royal collections on both sides of the Atlantic. The exhibition opened in Richmond, Virginia on March 17, 2007, and closed at the Smithsonian International Gallery on October 31, 2009.\\r\\nThe related online exhibition explores the international origins of the societies of Canada and the United States and commemorates the 400th anniversary of three lasting settlements in Jamestown (1607), Qubec (1608), and Santa Fe (1609). The site is accessible in three languages.[38]","input":"When did the first settlers come to america?"},{"output":"46 inches","context":"In the sport of cricket, the crease is a certain area demarcated by white lines painted or chalked on the field of play, and pursuant to the rules of cricket they help determine legal play in different ways for the fielding and batting side. They define the area within which the batsmen and bowlers operate. The term crease may refer to any of the lines themselves, particularly the popping crease, or to the region that they demark. Law 7 of the Laws of Cricket governs the size and position of the crease markings, and defines the actual line as the back edge of the width of the marked line on the grass, i.e., the edge nearest to the wicket at that end.\\r\\nFour creases (one popping crease, one bowling crease, and two return creases) are drawn at each end of the pitch, around the two sets of stumps. The batsmen generally play in and run between the areas defined by the creases at each end of the pitch. The bowling creases lie 22 yards (66 feet or 20.12 m) away, and marks the other end of the pitch. For the fielding side, the crease defines whether there is a No ball because a fielder has encroached on the pitch or the wicket-keeper has moved in front of the wicket before he is permitted to do so. In addition, historically part of the bowler's back foot in the delivery stride was required to fall behind the bowling crease to avoid a delivery being a No ball. This rule was replaced by a requirement that the bowler's front foot in the delivery stride must land with some part of it behind the popping crease (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of creases is uncertain but they were certainly in use by the beginning of the 18th century when they were created by scratch marks, the popping crease being 46 inches in front of the wicket at each end of the pitch. In the course of time, the scratches became cuts which were an inch deep and an inch wide. The cut was in use until the second half of the 19th century.[1] Sometime during the early career of Alfred Shaw, he suggested that the creases should be made by lines of whitewash and this was gradually adopted through the 1870s.[2]\\r\\nThe origin of the term \\"popping crease\\" is unknown. One popping crease is drawn at each end of the pitch in front of each set of stumps. The popping crease is 4 feet (1.22 m) in front of and parallel to the bowling crease. Although it is considered to have unlimited length (in other words, runs across the entire field) the popping crease must be marked to at least 6 feet (1.83 metres) perpendicular to the pitch, on either side of the middle of the pitch.[3][4]\\r\\nFor the fielding team the popping crease is used as one test of whether the bowler has bowled a No ball. To avoid a No ball, some part of the bowler's front foot in the delivery stride (that is, the stride when he releases the ball) must be behind the popping crease when it lands, although it does not have to be grounded. The foot may be on the line as long as some part of his/her foot is behind the line.[3][5] This has given rise to the term \\"the line belongs to the umpire.\\"[6]\\r\\nFor a batsman the popping crease ÿ which can be referred to as the batting crease in the context of batting ÿ determines whether they have been stumped or run out. This is described in Laws 29, 38, and 39 of the Laws of Cricket.[4] Both involve the wicket being put down before a batsman can touch his body or bat to the ground behind the popping crease and make his ground and return safely from his run.[7] A 2010 amendment to Law 29 clarified the circumstance where the wicket is put down while a batsman has become fully airborne after having first made his ground; the batsman is regarded to not be out of his ground.[8]\\r\\nThe popping crease is visible here, with England's Marcus Trescothick playing a shot that has involved him moving forward over his own crease to intercept the ball. In taking a successful run, he must ground his bat behind the corresponding crease at the other end of the pitch, and his batting partner must in turn ground himself behind Trescothick's crease.[4] Should Trescothick have ventured beyond his crease in playing his shot, he risked being stumped.[3][4]\\r\\nJim Allenby bowling, he must ground some part of his foot behind his popping crease and within the return creases for the ball to be a legal delivery. As a member of the fielding side, he can also attempt to run out a batsman by breaking the stumps with the ball before the batsman manages to return to the popping crease.[3][4]\\r\\nHere the batsman has played a shot and missed, with the wicketkeeper receiving the ball. The 'keeper, believing that in playing his shot the batsman has ventured beyond his popping crease, has broken the stumps with the ball in an attempt to dismiss him 'stumped'. He is appealing to the umpire to review and either accept or refuse the dismissal. It now falls to the umpire to adjudge whether the batsman had indeed ventured beyond his crease, a decision that in modern cricket is assisted by technology and replays.\\r\\nDrawn parallel with the popping crease and four feet away from it. The bowling crease is the line through the centres of the three stumps at each end. It is 8 ft 8 in (2.64 m) long, with the stumps in the centre.\\r\\nFour return creases are drawn, one on each side of each set of stumps. The return creases lie perpendicular to the popping crease and the bowling crease, 4 feet 4?inches (1.32 m) either side of and parallel to the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each return crease line starts at the popping crease but the other end is considered to be unlimited in length and must be marked to a minimum of 8 feet (2.44 m) from the popping crease.[3][4]\\r\\nThe return creases are primarily used to determine whether the bowler has bowled a No ball. To avoid a No ball, the bowler's back foot in the delivery stride must land within and not touch the return crease. This is to stop the bowler from bowling at the batsmen from an unfair angle (i.e. diagonally).[3]\\r\\nThough the relatively small size of the crease is such that they limit the degree to which a batsman or a bowler can alter where they stand to face or deliver a ball, there is a degree of latitude afforded whereby both can move around the crease as long as they remain within the aforementioned confines. Batsmen 'use the crease' when they move toward leg or off, before or while playing a shot. Bowlers 'use the crease' by varying the position of their feet, relative to the stumps, at the moment of delivery. In so doing, they can alter the angle of delivery and the trajectory of the ball.[4]","input":"How far is the crease from the wicket?"},{"output":"pastoral peoples speaking the Proto-Indo-European language, who departed from the Yamnaya and related cultures in the PonticÿCaspian steppe, starting at c.?4000 BCE","context":"","input":"Who were the indo-europeans and where did they originate?"},{"output":"Mongol invasion","context":"Kievan Rus' (Old East Slavic: ??^ (Rus'?), ??^? 켼?

The modern peoples of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine all claim Kievan Rus' as their cultural ancestors,[6] with Belarus and Russia deriving their names from it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt its greatest extent, in the mid-11th century, it stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south and from the headwaters of the Vistula in the west to the Taman Peninsula in the east,[7][8] uniting the majority of East Slavic tribes.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Russian historiography, the first ruler to start uniting East Slavic lands into what has become known as Kievan Rus' was Prince Oleg (882ÿ912). He extended his control from Novgorod south along the Dnieper river valley to protect trade from Khazar incursions from the east,[4] and he moved his capital to the more strategic Kiev. Sviatoslav I (died 972) achieved the first major expansion of Kievan Rus' territorial control, fighting a war of conquest against the Khazars. Vladimir the Great (980ÿ1015) introduced Christianity with his own baptism and, by decree, extended it to all inhabitants of Kiev and beyond. Kievan Rus' reached its greatest extent under Yaroslav the Wise (1019ÿ1054); his sons assembled and issued its first written legal code, the Rus' Justice, shortly after his death.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state declined beginning in the late 11th century and during the 12th century, disintegrating into various rival regional powers.[10] It was further weakened by economic factors, such as the collapse of Rus' commercial ties to Byzantium due to the decline of Constantinople[11] and the accompanying diminution of trade routes through its territory. The state finally fell to the Mongol invasion of the 1240s.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its existence, Kievan Rus' was known as the \\"land of the Rus'\\" (Old East Slavic: ??^? 켼?, from the ethnonym ??^; Greek: ???; Arabic: ?????? al-Rs), in Greek as ?߿?ϫ, in Old French as Russie, Rossie, in Latin as Russia (with local German spelling variants Ruscia and Ruzzia), and from the 12th century also Ruthenia.[2] Various etymologies have been proposed, including Ruotsi, the Finnish designation for Sweden, and Ros, a tribe from the middle Dnieper valley region.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term Kievan Rus' (?־ ^ Kievskaya Rus) was coined in the 19th century in Russian historiography to refer to the period when the centre was in Kiev.[13] In English, the term was introduced in the early 20th century, when it was found in the 1913 English translation of Vasily Klyuchevsky's A History of Russia,[14] to distinguish the early polity from successor states, which were also named Rus. Later, the Russian term was rendered into Belarusian and Ukrainian as ?? ^ (Kije?skaja Rus) and ??־^ ^ (Kyivs'ka Rus), respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the emergence of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century AD, the lands between the Baltic Sea and Black Sea were primarily populated by eastern Slavic tribes.[15] In the northern region around Novgorod were the Ilmen Slavs[16] and neighboring Krivichi, who occupied territories surrounding the headwaters of the West Dvina, Dnieper, and Volga Rivers. To their north, in the Ladoga and Karelia regions, were the Finnic Chud tribe. In the south, in the area around Kiev, were the Poliane, a group of Slavicized tribes with Iranian origins,[17] the Drevliane to the west of the Dnieper, and the Severiane to the east. To their north and east were the Vyatichi, and to their south was forested land settled by Slav farmers, giving way to steppelands populated by nomadic herdsmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nControversy persists over whether the Rus' were Varangians (Vikings) or Slavs. This uncertainty is due largely to a paucity of contemporary sources. Attempts to address this question instead rely on archaeological evidence, the accounts of foreign observers, and legends and literature from centuries later.[18] To some extent the controversy is related to the foundation myths of modern states in the region.[19] According to the \\"Normanist\\" view, the Rus' were Scandinavians, while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs.[20][21][22] Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs, the Primary Chronicle,[23] although even this account was not produced until the 12th century.[24] Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians,[25] noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in modern Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names.[26] Nevertheless, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at the latest.[27] On balance, it seems likely that the Rus' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class, while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs.[26] Considering the linguistic arguments mounted by nationalist scholars, if the proto-Rus' were Scandinavians, they must have quickly become nativized, adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhmad ibn Fadlan, an Arab traveler during the 10th century, provided one of the earliest written descriptions of the Rus': \\"They are as tall as a date palm, blond and ruddy, so that they do not need to wear a tunic nor a cloak; rather the men among them wear garments that only cover half of his body and leaves one of his hands free.\\"[28] Liutprand of Cremona, who was twice an envoy to the Byzantine court (949 and 968), identifies the \\"Russi\\" with the Norse (\\"the Russi, whom we call Norsemen by another name\\")[29] but explains the name as a Greek term referring to their physical traits (\\"A certain people made up of a part of the Norse, whom the Greeks call [...] the Russi on account of their physical features, we designate as Norsemen because of the location of their origin.\\").[30] Leo the Deacon, a 10th-century Byzantine historian and chronicler, refers to the Rus' as \\"Scythians\\" and notes that they tended to adopt Greek rituals and customs.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Primary Chronicle, the territories of the East Slavs in the 9th century were divided between the Varangians and the Khazars.[32] The Varangians are first mentioned imposing tribute from Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859.[33] In 862, the Finnic and Slavic tribes in the area of Novgorod rebelled against the Varangians, driving them \\"back beyond the sea and, refusing them further tribute, set out to govern themselves.\\" The tribes had no laws, however, and soon began to make war with one another, prompting them to invite the Varangians back to rule them and bring peace to the region:\\r\\n\\r\\nThey said to themselves, \\"Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law.\\" They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Rus'.  The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichs and the Ves then said to the Rus', \\"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\\". They thus selected three brothers with their kinfolk, who took with them all the Rus' and migrated.\\r\\nThe three brothersRurik, Sineus, and Truvorestablished themselves in Novgorod, Beloozero, and Izborsk, respectively.[35] Two of the brothers died, and Rurik became the sole ruler of the territory and progenitor of the Rurik Dynasty.[36] A short time later, two of Ruriks men, Askold and Dir, asked him for permission to go to Tsargrad (Constantinople). On their way south, they discovered \\"a small city on a hill,\\" Kiev, captured it and the surrounding country from the Khazars, populated the region with more Varangians, and \\"established their dominion over the country of the Polyanians.\\"[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chronicle reports that Askold and Dir continued to Constantinople with a navy to attack the city in 863ÿ66, catching the Byzantines by surprise and ravaging the surrounding area,[38] though other accounts date the attack in 860.[39] Patriarch Photius vividly describes the \\"universal\\" devastation of the suburbs and nearby islands,[40] and another account further details the destruction and slaughter of the invasion.[41] The Rus' turned back before attacking the city itself, due either to a storm dispersing their boats, the return of the Emperor, or in a later account, due to a miracle after a ceremonial appeal by the Patriarch and the Emperor to the Virgin.[42] The attack was the first encounter between the Rus' and Byzantines and led the Patriarch to send missionaries north to engage and attempt to convert the Rus' and the Slavs.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nRurik led the Rus' until his death in about 879, bequeathing his kingdom to his kinsman, Prince Oleg, as regent for his young son, Igor.[38][45] In 880-82, Oleg led a military force south along the Dnieper river, capturing Smolensk and Lyubech before reaching Kiev, where he deposed and killed Askold and Dir, proclaimed himself prince, and declared Kiev the \\"mother of Rus' cities.\\"[46][47] Oleg set about consolidating his power over the surrounding region and the riverways north to Novgorod, imposing tribute on the East Slav tribes.[37][48] In 883, he conquered the Drevlians, imposing a fur tribute on them. By 885 he had subjugated the Poliane, Severiane, Vyatichi, and Radimichs, forbidding them to pay further tribute to the Khazars. Oleg continued to develop and expand a network of Rus' forts in Slav lands, begun by Rurik in the north.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new Kievan state prospered due to its abundant supply of furs, beeswax, honey, and slaves for export,[50] and because it controlled three main trade routes of Eastern Europe. In the north, Novgorod served as a commercial link between the Baltic Sea and the Volga trade route to the lands of the Volga Bulgars, the Khazars, and across the Caspian Sea as far as Baghdad, providing access to markets and products from Central Asia and the Middle East.[51][52] Trade from the Baltic also moved south on a network of rivers and short portages along the Dnieper known as the \\"route from the Varangians to the Greeks,\\" continuing to the Black Sea and on to Constantinople. Kiev was a central outpost along the Dnieper route and a hub with the east-west overland trade route between the Khazars and the Germanic lands of Central Europe.[53] These commercial connections enriched Rus' merchants and princes, funding military forces and the construction of churches, palaces, fortifications, and further towns.[52] Demand for luxury goods fostered production of expensive jewelry and religious wares, allowing their export, and an advanced credit and money-lending system may have also been in place.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapid expansion of the Rus' to the south led to conflict and volatile relationships with the Khazars and other neighbors on the Pontic steppe.[54][55][56] The Khazars dominated the Black Sea steppe during the 8th century,[57] trading and frequently allying with the Byzantine Empire against Persians and Arabs. In the late 8th century, the collapse of the G?ktrk Khaganate led the Magyars and the Pechenegs, Ugric and Turkic peoples from Central Asia, to migrate west into the steppe region,[58] leading to military conflict, disruption of trade, and instability within the Khazar Khaganate.[59] The Rus' and Slavs had earlier allied with the Khazars against Arab raids on the Caucasus, but they increasingly worked against them to secure control of the trade routes.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Byzantine Empire was able to take advantage of the turmoil to expand its political influence and commercial relationships, first with the Khazars and later with the Rus' and other steppe groups.[54] The Byzantines established the Theme of Cherson, formally known as Klimata, in the Crimea in the 830s to defend against raids by the Rus' and to protect vital grain shipments supplying Constantinople.[61] Cherson also served as a key diplomatic link with the Khazars and others on the steppe, and it became the centre of Black Sea commerce.[62] The Byzantines also helped the Khazars build a fortress at Sarkel on the Don river to protect their northwest frontier against incursions by the Turkic migrants and the Rus', and to control caravan trade routes and the portage between the Don and Volga rivers.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expansion of the Rus' put further military and economic pressure on the Khazars, depriving them of territory, tributaries, and trade.[64] In around 890, Oleg waged an indecisive war in the lands of the lower Dniester and Dnieper rivers with the Tivertsi and the Ulichs, who were likely acting as vassals of the Magyars, blocking Rus' access to the Black Sea.[65][66] In 894, the Magyars and Pechenegs were drawn into the wars between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire. The Byzantines arranged for the Magyars to attack Bulgarian territory from the north, and Bulgaria in turn persuaded the Pechenegs to attack the Magyars from their rear. Boxed in, the Magyars were forced to migrate further west across the Carpathian Mountains into the Hungarian plain, depriving the Khazars of an important ally and a buffer from the Rus'.[67][68] The migration of the Magyars allowed Rus' access to the Black Sea,[69] and they soon launched excursions into Khazar territory along the sea coast, up the Don river, and into the lower Volga region. The Rus' were raiding and plundering into the Caspian Sea region from 864,[70] with the first large-scale expedition in 913, when they extensively raided Baku, Gilan, Mazandaran and penetrated into the Caucasus.[71][72][73]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the 10th century progressed, the Khazars were no longer able to command tribute from the Volga Bulgars, and their relationship with the Byzantines deteriorated, as Byzantium increasingly allied with the Pechenegs against them.[74] The Pechenegs were thus secure to raid the lands of the Khazars from their base between the Volga and Don rivers, allowing them to expand to the west.[55] Rus' relations with the Pechenegs were complex, as the groups alternately formed alliances with and against one another. The Pechenegs were nomads roaming the steppe raising livestock which they traded with the Rus' for agricultural goods and other products.[75] The lucrative Rus' trade with the Byzantine Empire had to pass through Pecheneg-controlled territory, so the need for generally peaceful relations was essential. Nevertheless, while the Primary Chronicle reports the Pechenegs entering Rus' territory in 915 and then making peace, they were waging war with one another again in 920.[76][77] Pechenegs are reported assisting the Rus' in later campaigns against the Byzantines, yet allied with the Byzantines against the Rus' at other times.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Rus' attack on Constantinople in 860, the Byzantine Patriarch Photius sent missionaries north to convert the Rus' and the Slavs. Prince Rastislav of Moravia had requested the Emperor to provide teachers to interpret the holy scriptures, so in 863 the brothers Cyril and Methodius were sent as missionaries, due to their knowledge of the Slavonic language.[44][79][80] The Slavs had no written language, so the brothers devised the Glagolitic alphabet, later developed into Cyrillic, and standardized the language of the Slavs, later known as Old Church Slavonic. They translated portions of the Bible and drafted the first Slavic civil code and other documents, and the language and texts spread throughout Slavic territories, including Kievan Rus'. The mission of Cyril and Methodius served both evangelical and diplomatic purposes, spreading Byzantine cultural influence in support of imperial foreign policy.[81] In 867 the Patriarch announced that the Rus' had accepted a bishop, and in 874 he speaks of an \\"Archbishop of the Rus'.\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nRelations between the Rus' and Byzantines became more complex after Oleg took control over Kiev, reflecting commercial, cultural, and military concerns.[82] The wealth and income of the Rus' depended heavily upon trade with Byzantium. Constantine Porphyrogenitus described the annual course of the princes of Kiev, collecting tribute from client tribes, assembling the product into a flotilla of hundreds of boats, conducting them down the Dnieper to the Black Sea, and sailing to the estuary of the Dniester, the Danube delta, and on to Constantinople.[75][83] On their return trip they would carry silk fabrics, spices, wine, and fruit. The importance of this trade relationship led to military action when disputes arose. The Primary Chronicle reports that the Rus' attacked Constantinople again in 907, probably to secure trade access. The Chronicle glorifies the military prowess and shrewdness of Oleg, an account imbued with legendary detail.[43][84] Byzantine sources do not mention the attack, but a pair of treaties in 907 and 911 set forth a trade agreement with the Rus',[76][85] the terms suggesting pressure on the Byzantines, who granted the Rus' quarters and supplies for their merchants and tax-free trading privileges in Constantinople.[43][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chronicle provides a mythic tale of Oleg's death. A sorcerer prophesies that the death of the Grand Prince would be associated with a certain horse. Oleg has the horse sequestered, and it later dies. Oleg goes to visit the horse and stands over the carcass, gloating that he had outlived the threat, when a snake strikes him from among the bones, and he soon becomes ill and dies.[87][88] The Chronicle reports that Prince Igor succeeded Oleg in 913, and after some brief conflicts with the Drevlians and the Pechenegs, a period of peace ensued for over twenty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 941, Igor led another major Rus' attack on Constantinople, probably over trading rights again.[43][89] A navy of 10,000 vessels, including Pecheneg allies, landed on the Bithynian coast and devastated the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus.[90] The attack was well-timed, perhaps due to intelligence, as the Byzantine fleet was occupied with the Arabs in the Mediterranean, and the bulk of its army was stationed in the east. The Rus' burned towns, churches, and monasteries, butchering the people and amassing booty. The emperor arranged for a small group of retired ships to be outfitted with Greek fire throwers and sent them out to meet the Rus', luring them into surrounding the contingent before unleashing the Greek fire.[91] Liutprand of Cremona wrote that \\"the Rus', seeing the flames, jumped overboard, preferring water to fire. Some sank, weighed down by the weight of their breastplates and helmets; others caught fire.\\" Those captured were beheaded. The ploy dispelled the Rus' fleet, but their attacks continued into the hinterland as far as Nicomedia, with many atrocities reported as victims were crucified and set up for use as targets. At last a Byzantine army arrived from the Balkans to drive the Rus' back, and a naval contingent reportedly destroyed much of the Rus' fleet on its return voyage (possibly an exaggeration since the Rus' soon mounted another attack). The outcome indicates increased military might by Byzantium since 911, suggesting a shift in the balance of power.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nIgor returned to Kiev keen for revenge. He assembled a large force of warriors from among neighboring Slavs and Pecheneg allies, and sent for reinforcements of Varangians from beyond the sea.[91][92] In 944 the Rus' force advanced again on the Greeks, by land and sea, and a Byzantine force from Cherson responded. The Emperor sent gifts and offered tribute in lieu of war, and the Rus' accepted. Envoys were sent between the Rus', the Byzantines, and the Bulgarians in 945, and a peace treaty was completed. The agreement again focused on trade, but this time with terms less favorable to the Rus', including stringent regulations on the conduct of Rus' merchants in Cherson and Constantinople and specific punishments for violations of the law.[93] The Byzantines may have been motivated to enter the treaty out of concern of a prolonged alliance of the Rus', Pechenegs, and Bulgarians against them,[94] though the more favorable terms further suggest a shift in power.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the death of Grand Prince Igor in 945, his wife Olga ruled as regent in Kiev until their son Sviatoslav reached maturity (ca. 963).[95] His decade-long reign over Rus' was marked by rapid expansion through the conquest of the Khazars of the Pontic steppe and the invasion of the Balkans. By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kiev to Pereyaslavets on the Danube in 969. In contrast with his mother's conversion to Christianity, Sviatoslav, like his druzhina, remained a staunch pagan. Due to his abrupt death in an ambush in 972, Sviatoslav's conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a fratricidal feud among his sons, which resulted in two of his three sons being killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of the Grand Duke was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between Vladimir the Great and Yaropolk I. The region of Kiev dominated the state of Kievan Rus' for the next two centuries. The Grand Prince (\\"velikiy kniaz'\\") of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute. The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Vladimir the Great (980ÿ1015) and Prince Yaroslav I the Wise (1019ÿ1054). Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg.\\r\\n\\r\\nVladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H?kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk.[96] As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nVladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the Dnieper River. Adherence to the Eastern Church had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a liturgy written in Cyrillic and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the Slavic peoples. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the Eastern Slavs and introduced them to rudimentary Greek philosophy, science, and historiography without the necessity of learning Greek (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek).[98] In contrast, educated people in medieval Western and Central Europe learned Latin. Enjoying independence from the Roman authority and free from tenets of Latin learning, the East Slavs developed their own literature and fine arts, quite distinct from those of other Eastern Orthodox countries.[citation needed] (See Old East Slavic language and Architecture of Kievan Rus for details). Following the Great Schism of 1054, the Rus' church maintained communion with both Rome and Constantinople for some time, but along with most of the Eastern churches it eventually split to follow the Eastern Orthodox. That being said, unlike other parts of the Greek world, Kievan Rus' did not have a strong hostility to the Western world.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nYaroslav, known as \\"the Wise\\", struggled for power with his brothers. A son of Vladimir the Great, he was vice-regent of Novgorod at the time of his father's death in 1015. Subsequently, his eldest surviving brother, Svyatopolk the Accursed, killed three of his other brothers and seized power in Kiev. Yaroslav, with the active support of the Novgorodians and the help of Viking mercenaries, defeated Svyatopolk and became the grand prince of Kiev in 1019.[100] Although he first established his rule over Kiev in 1019, he did not have uncontested rule of all of Kievan Rus' until 1036. Like Vladimir, Yaroslav was eager to improve relations with the rest of Europe, especially the Byzantine Empire. Yaroslav's granddaughter, Eupraxia the daughter of his son Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev, was married to Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, Russkaya Pravda; built Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev and Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod; patronized local clergy and monasticism; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great Kiev Pechersk Lavra (monastery), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, Rurik's descendants shared power over Kievan Rus'. Princely succession moved from elder to younger brother and from uncle to nephew, as well as from father to son. Junior members of the dynasty usually began their official careers as rulers of a minor district, progressed to more lucrative principalities, and then competed for the coveted throne of Kiev.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gradual disintegration of the Kievan Rus' began in the 11th century, after the death of Yaroslav the Wise. The position of the Grand Prince of Kiev was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn unconventional power succession system was established (rota system) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.[citation needed] Familicide was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of Vladimir II Monomakh as the Grand Prince of Kiev,[clarification needed] in turn creating major squabbles between Olegovichi from Chernihiv, Monomakhs from Pereyaslav, Izyaslavichi from Turov/Volhynia, and Polotsk Princes.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise. The rivaling Principality of Polotsk was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod, while Rostislav Vladimirovich was fighting for the Black Sea port of Tmutarakan belonging to Chernihiv.[citation needed] Three of Yaroslav's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the Battle of the Alta River. At the same time, an uprising took place in Kiev, bringing to power Vseslav of Polotsk who supported the traditional Slavic paganism.[citation needed] The ruling Grand Prince Iziaslav fled to Poland asking for support and in couple of years returned to establish the order.[citation needed] The affairs became even more complicated by the end of the 11th century driving the state into chaos and constant warfare. On the initiative of Vladimir II Monomakh in 1097 the first federal council of Kievan Rus took place near Chernihiv in the city of Liubech with the main intention to find an understanding among the fighting sides. However, even though that did not really stop the fighting, it certainly cooled things off.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1130, all descendants of Vseslav the Seer had been exiled to the Byzantine Empire by Mstislav the Great. The most fierce resistance to Monomakhs posed Olegovichi when the izgoi Vsevolod II managed to become the Grand Prince of Kiev. Rostislavichi who have initially established in Halych lands by 1189 were defeated by the Monomakh-Piast descendant Roman the Great.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decline of Constantinople?ÿ a main trading partner of Kievan Rus'?ÿ played a significant role in the decline of the Kievan Rus'. The trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly Byzantine) through eastern Europe to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. Kiev was the main power and initiator in this relationship, once the Byzantine Empire fell into turmoil and the supplies became erratic, profits dried out, and Kiev lost its appeal.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last ruler to maintain a united state was Mstislav the Great. After his death in 1132, the Kievan Rus' fell into recession and a rapid decline, and Mstislav's successor Yaropolk II of Kiev instead of focusing on the external threat of the Cumans was embroiled in conflicts with the growing power of the Novgorod Republic. In 1169, as the Kievan Rus' state was full of internal conflict, Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir sacked the city of Kiev. The sack of the city fundamentally changed the perception of Kiev and was evidence of the fragmentation of the Kievan Rus'.[101] By the end of the 12th century, the Kievan state became even further fragmented and had been divided into roughly twelve different principalities.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crusades brought a shift in European trade routes that accelerated the decline of Kievan Rus'. In 1204, the forces of the Fourth Crusade sacked Constantinople, making the Dnieper trade route marginal.[11] At the same time, the Teutonic Knights (of the Northern Crusades) were conquering the Baltic region and threatening the Lands of Novgorod. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local Orthodox Christianity of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the north, the Republic of Novgorod prospered because it controlled trade routes from the River Volga to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local oligarchy ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.[103] Now an independent city republic, and referred to as \\"Lord Novgorod the Great\\" it would spread its \\"mercantile interest\\" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.[103] In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own archbishop, named Ilya, a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the Grand Duchy of Moscow by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of Rostov, the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by Suzdal and then by the city of Vladimir, which become the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal'. The combined principality of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (춶ҿҳ 椷^/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the Mongol invasion, the metropolitan moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the southwest, the principality of Halych had developed trade relations with its Polish, Hungarian and Lithuanian neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, Prince Roman Mstislavych united the two previously separate principalities. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of Knyaz of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, Prince Daniel (r. 1238ÿ1264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \\"Rex Rusiae\\" (\\"King of Rus\\") from the Roman papacy, apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople granted the King of Poland a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. Cyprian, a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the Russian countries was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \\"Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'\\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the Mstislavich branch of the Rurikids in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took Volhynia, including Kiev, conquered by Gediminas in 1321 ending the rule of Rurikids in the city. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over Ruthenia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the Mongol invasion of Rus', fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the Golden Horde (the so-called Tatar Yoke). In the late 15th century, the Muscovite Grand Dukes began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of translatio imperii.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central Ukraine and Belarus, fell to the Gediminids, the powerful, largely Ruthenized Grand Duchy of Lithuania drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions. Due to the fact of the economic and cultural core of Rus' being located on the territory of modern Ukraine, Ukrainian historians and scholars consider Kievan Rus' to be a founding Ukrainian state.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the north-eastern periphery of Kievan Rus', traditions were adapted in the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality that gradually gravitated towards Moscow. To the very north, the Novgorod and Pskov Feudal Republics were less autocratic than Vladimir- Suzdal- Moscow until they were absorbed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Russian historians consider Kievan Rus \\"the first period of Russian history\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Kievan era, trade and transport depended largely on networks of rivers and portages.[104] The peoples of Rus' experienced a period of great economic expansion, opening trade routes with the Vikings to the north and west and with the Byzantine Greeks to the south and west; traders also began to travel south and east, eventually making contact with Persia and the peoples of Central Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the expansion of trade and its geographical proximity, Kiev became the most important trade centre and chief among the communes; therefore the leader of Kiev gained political \\"control\\" over the surrounding areas. This princedom emerged from a coalition of traditional patriarchic family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land. This union developed the first major cities in the Rus' and was the first notable form of self-government. As these communes became larger, the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded. This shift in ideology became known as the verv'.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of Slavic and Scandinavian elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of Western European feudalism. Nevertheless, urban merchants, artisans and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the veche (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of slaves. More important was a class of tribute-paying peasants, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal serfdom characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or smerdy. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also: Old Russian Law, main source: Russkaya Pravda.\\r\\n\\r\\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe,[105] was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.[106] Literacy in Kiev, Novgorod and other large cities was high.[107][108] As birch bark documents attest, they exchanged love letters and prepared cheat sheets for schools. Novgorod had a sewage system[109] and wood paving not often found in other cities at the time. The Russkaya Pravda confined punishments to fines and generally did not use capital punishment.[110] Certain rights were accorded to women, such as property and inheritance rights.[111][112][113]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic development of Kievan Rus may be translated into demographic statistics. Around 1200, Kiev had a population of 50,000, Novgorod and Chernigov both had around 30,000.[114] Constantinople had population of about 400,000 around 1180.[115] The Soviet scholar Mikhail Tikhomirov calculated that Kievan Rus' on the eve of the Mongol invasion had around 300 urban centres.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nKievan Rus' also played an important genealogical role in European politics. Yaroslav the Wise, whose stepmother belonged to the Macedonian dynasty, which ruled the Byzantine empire from 867 to 1056, married the only legitimate daughter of the king who Christianized Sweden. His daughters became queens of Hungary, France and Norway, his sons married the daughters of a Polish king and a Byzantine emperor (not to mention a niece of the Pope), while his granddaughters were a German Empress and (according to one theory) the queen of Scotland. A grandson married the only daughter of the last Anglo-Saxon king of England. Thus the Rurikids were a well-connected royal family of the time.[117][118]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 9th century, the Pecheneg nomads began an uneasy relationship with Kievan Rus. For over two centuries they launched sporadic raids into the lands of Rus, which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars (such as the 920 war on the Pechenegs by Igor of Kiev reported in the Primary Chronicle), but there were also temporary military alliances (e.g. the 943 Byzantine campaign by Igor).[119] In 968, the Pechenegs attacked and besieged the city of Kiev.[120] Some speculation exists that the Pechenegs drove off the Tivertsi and the Ulichs to the regions of the upper Dniester river in Bukovina. The Byzantine Empire was known to support the Pechenegs in their military campaigns against the Eastern Slavic states.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoniak was a Cuman khan who led a series of invasions on Kievan Rus. In 1096, Boniak attacked Kiev, plundered the Kiev Monastery of the Caves, and burned down the prince's palace in Berestovo. He was defeated in 1107 by Vladimir Monomakh, Oleg, Sviatopolk and other Rus princes.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mongol Empire invaded Kievan Rus' in the 13th century, destroying numerous cities, including Ryazan, Kolomna, Moscow, Vladimir and Kiev. Giovanni de Plano Carpini, the Pope's envoy to the Mongol Great Khan, traveled through Kiev in February 1246 and wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"They [the Mongols] attacked Rus, where they made great havoc, destroying cities and fortresses and slaughtering men; and they laid siege to Kiev, the capital of Rus; after they had besieged the city for a long time, they took it and put the inhabitants to death. When we were journeying through that land we came across countless skulls and bones of dead men lying about on the ground. Kiev had been a very large and thickly populated town, but now it has been reduced almost to nothing, for there are at the present time scarce two hundred houses there and the inhabitants are kept in complete slavery\\"[122]\\r\\nByzantium quickly became the main trading and cultural partner for Kiev, but relations were not always friendly. The most serious conflict between the two powers was the war of 968ÿ971 in Bulgaria, but several Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople itself are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, they were concluded by trade treaties that were generally favourable to the Rus'.\\r\\n\\r\\nRus'-Byzantine relations became closer following the marriage of the porphyrogenita Anna to Vladimir the Great, and the subsequent Christianization of the Rus': Byzantine priests, architects and artists were invited to work on numerous cathedrals and churches around Rus', expanding Byzantine cultural influence even further. Numerous Rus' served in the Byzantine army as mercenaries, most notably as the famous Varangian Guard.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 988, the Christian Church in Rus' territorially fell under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople after it was officially adopted as the state religion. According to several chronicles after that date the predominant cult of Slavic paganism was persecuted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact date of creation of the Kiev Metropolis is uncertain, as well as who was the first leader of the church. Predominantly it is considered that the first head was Michael I of Kiev, however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the Church of the Tithes. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter Yuriy-upon-Ros. The Kiev Metropolitan sent his own delegation to the Council of Bari in 1098.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the sacking of Kiev in 1169, part of the Kiev metropolis started to move[citation needed] to Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, concluding the move sometime after 1240 when Kiev was taken by Batu Khan. Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, Lev I of Galicia petitioned Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Church of the Tithes was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir was chosen as the new cathedral.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Che?m (1235), Tver (1271). There also were dioceses in Zakarpattia and Tmutarakan. In 1261 the Sarai-Batu diocese was established.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 5027N 3031E? / ?50.450N 30.517E? / 50.450; 30.517","input":"Which group ended the period of kievan rus dominance?"},{"output":"collections of tissues with a similar function","context":"Organs are collections of tissues with a similar function. Plant and animal life relies on many organs that coexist in organ systems.[2]\\r\\nOrgans are composed of main tissue, parenchyma, and \\"sporadic\\" tissues, stroma. The main tissue is that which is unique for the specific organ, such as the myocardium, the main tissue of the heart, while sporadic tissues include the nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues. The main tissues that make up an organ tend to have common embryologic origins, such as arising from the same germ layer. Functionally related organs often cooperate to form whole organ systems. Organs exist in all organisms. In single-celled organisms such as bacteria the functional analogue of an organ is known as an organelle. In plants there are three main organs.[3]\\r\\nA hollow organ is a visceral organ that forms a hollow tube, or pouch such as the stomach, intestine, or bladder.\\r\\nIn the study of anatomy, the term viscus is used to refer to an internal organ, and viscera is the plural form.[4][5] By one widely used definition of the term organ, 80 organs have been scientifically validated in the human body.[6][medical citation needed][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn biology, tissue is a cellular organizational level between cells and a complete organs. A tissue is an ensemble of similar cells and their extracellular matrix from the same origin that together carry out a specific function. Organs are then formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues.\\r\\nThe study of human and animal tissues is known as histology or, in connection with disease, histopathology. For plants, the discipline is called plant anatomy. The classical tools for studying tissues are the paraffin block in which tissue is embedded and then sectioned, the histological stain, and the optical microscope. In the last couple of decades, developments in electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and the use of frozen tissue sections have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. With these tools, the classical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and disease, enabling considerable refinement of medical diagnosis and prognosis.\\r\\nTwo or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a biological system or body system. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the nervous and endocrine system both operate via a shared organ, the hypothalamus. For this reason, the two systems are combined and studied as the neuroendocrine system. The same is true for the musculoskeletal system because of the relationship between the muscular and skeletal systems.\\r\\nMammals such as humans have a variety of organ systems. These specific systems are also widely studied in human anatomy.\\r\\nThe study of plant organs is referred to as plant morphology, rather than anatomy, as in animal systems. Organs of plants can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. Vegetative plant organs are roots, stems, and leaves. The reproductive organs are variable. In flowering plants, they are represented by the flower, seed and fruit. In conifers, the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a cone. In other divisions (phyla) of plants, the reproductive organs are called strobili, in Lycopodiophyta, or simply gametophores in mosses.\\r\\nThe vegetative organs are essential for maintaining the life of a plant. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants, where some perform the vital functions, such as photosynthesis, while the reproductive organs are essential in reproduction. However, if there is asexual vegetative reproduction, the vegetative organs are those that create the new generation of plants (see clonal colony).\\r\\nMany societies have a system for Organ donation, in which a living or deceased donor's organ is transplanted into a person with a failing organ. The transplantation of larger solid organs often requires immunosuppression to prevent organ rejection or graft vs host disease.\\r\\nThere is considerable interest throughout the world in creating laboratory-grown or artificial organs.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe English word \\"organism\\" is a neologism coined in the 17th century, probably formed from the verb to organize. At first the word referred to an organization or social system. The meaning of a living animal or plant is first recorded in 1842.[8] Plant organs are made from tissue built up from different types of tissue. When there are three or more organs it is called an organ system. [9]\\r\\nThe adjective visceral, also splanchnic, is used for anything pertaining to the internal organs. Historically, viscera of animals were examined by Roman pagan priests like the haruspices or the augurs in order to divine the future by their shape, dimensions or other factors. This practice remains an important ritual in some remote, tribal societies.\\r\\nThe term \\"visceral\\" is contrasted with the term \\"parietal\\", meaning \\"of or relating to the wall of a body part, organ or cavity\\"[10] The two terms are often used in describing a membrane or piece of connective tissue, referring to the opposing sides.[citation needed]\\r\\nAristotle used the word frequently in his philosophy, both to describe the organs of plants or animals (e.g. the roots of a tree, the heart or liver of an animal), and to describe more abstract \\"parts\\" of an interconnected whole (e.g. his philosophical works, taken as a whole, are referred to as the \\"organon\\").\\r\\nSome alchemists (e.g. Paracelsus) adopted the Hermetic Qabalah assignment between the seven vital organs and the seven classical planets as follows:[11]\\r\\nThe variations in natural language definitions of what constitutes an organ, their degree of precision, and the variations in how they map to ontologies and taxonomies in information science (for example, to count how many organs exist in a typical human body) are topics explored by writer Carl Engelking of Discover magazine in 2017 as he analyzed the science journalism coverage of the evolving scientific understanding of the mesentery.[12] He explored a challenge now faced by anatomists: as human understanding of ontology generally (that is, how things are defined, and how the relationship of one thing to another is defined) meets applied ontology and ontology engineering, unification of varying views is in higher demand.[12] However, such unification always faces epistemologic frontiers, as humans can only declare computer ontologies with certainty and finality to the extent that their own cognitive taxonomy (that is, science's understanding of the universe) is certain and final. For example, the fact that the tissues of the mesentery are continuous was something that was simply not known for sure until it was demonstrated with microscopy.[13] Because humans cannot predict all future scientific discoveries, they cannot build a unified ontology that is totally certain and will never again change. However, one of the points made by an anatomist interviewed by Engelking is that, finality aside, much more could be done even now to represent existing human knowledge more clearly for computing purposes.\\r\\nThe organ level of organisation in animals can be first detected in flatworms and the more derived phyla. The less-advanced taxa (like Placozoa, Sponges and Radiata) do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs.\\r\\nComplex animals are composed of organs and many of these organs evolved a very long time ago. For example, the liver evolved in the stem vertebrates more than 500 million years ago, while the gut and brain are even more ancient, arising in the ancestor of vertebrates, insects, and worms more than 600 million years ago.\\r\\nGiven the ancient origin of most vertebrate organs, researchers have looked for model systems, where organs have evolved more recently, and ideally have evolved multiple times independently. An outstanding model for this kind of research is the placenta, which has evolved more than 100 times independently in vertebrates, has evolved relatively recently in some lineages, and exists in intermediate forms in extant taxa.[14] Studies on the evolution of the placenta have identified a variety of genetic and physiological processes that contribute to the origin and evolution of organs, these include the re-purposing of existing animal tissues, the acquisition of new functional properties by these tissues, and novel interactions of distinct tissue types.[14]","input":"What is the definition of a human organ?"},{"output":"Clinical psychology","context":"Clinical psychology is an integration of science, theory and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development.[1][2] Central to its practice are psychological assessment, clinical formulation and psychotherapy, although clinical psychologists also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.[3] In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession.\\r\\nThe field is often considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the USAthe Ph.D. Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research),[4] the Ph.D. science-practitioner model (integrating research and practice), and the Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model (focusing on clinical practice). In the UK the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe the training is at masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientationspsychodynamic, humanistic, behavior therapy/ cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest recorded approaches to assess and treat mental distress were a combination of religious, magical and/or medical perspectives.[5] Early examples of such physicians included Pata?jali, Padmasambhava,[6] Rhazes, Avicenna,[7] and Rumi.[8] In the early 19th century, one approach to study mental conditions and behavior was using phrenology, the study of personality by examining the shape of the skull. Other popular treatments at that time included the study of the shape of the face (physiognomy) and Mesmer's treatment for mental conditions using magnets (mesmerism). Spiritualism and Phineas Quimby's \\"mental healing\\" were also popular.[9]\\r\\nWhile the scientific community eventually came to reject all of these methods for treating mental illness, academic psychologists also were not concerned with serious forms of mental illness. The study of mental illness was already being done in the developing fields of psychiatry and neurology within the asylum movement.[5] It was not until the end of the 19th century, around the time when Sigmund Freud was first developing his \\"talking cure\\" in Vienna, that the first scientific application of clinical psychology began.\\r\\nBy the second half of the 1800s, the scientific study of psychology was becoming well established in university laboratories. Although there were a few scattered voices calling for an applied psychology, the general field looked down upon this idea and insisted on \\"pure\\" science as the only respectable practice.[5] This changed when Lightner Witmer (1867ÿ1956), a past student of Wundt and head of the psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed to treat a young boy who had trouble with spelling. His successful treatment was soon to lead to Witmer's opening of the first psychological clinic at Penn in 1896, dedicated to helping children with learning disabilities.[10] Ten years later in 1907, Witmer was to found the first journal of this new field, The Psychological Clinic, where he coined the term \\"clinical psychology\\", defined as \\"the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, with the intention of promoting change\\".[11] The field was slow to follow Witmer's example, but by 1914, there were 26 similar clinics in the U.S.[12]\\r\\nEven as clinical psychology was growing, working with issues of serious mental distress remained the domain of psychiatrists and neurologists.[13] However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at psychological assessment. Psychologists' reputation as assessment experts became solidified during World War I with the development of two intelligence tests, Army Alpha and Army Beta (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits.[9][10] Due in large part to the success of these tests, assessment was to become the core discipline of clinical psychology for the next quarter century, when another war would propel the field into treatment.\\r\\nThe field began to organize under the name \\"clinical psychology\\" in 1917 with the founding of the American Association of Clinical Psychology. This only lasted until 1919, after which the American Psychological Association (founded by G. Stanley Hall in 1892) developed a section on Clinical Psychology, which offered certification until 1927.[12] Growth in the field was slow for the next few years when various unconnected psychological organizations came together as the American Association of Applied Psychology in 1930, which would act as the primary forum for psychologists until after World War II when the APA reorganized.[14] In 1945, the APA created what is now called Division 12, its division of clinical psychology, which remains a leading organization in the field. Psychological societies and associations in other English-speaking countries developed similar divisions, including in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\\r\\nWhen World War II broke out, the military once again called upon clinical psychologists. As soldiers began to return from combat, psychologists started to notice symptoms of psychological trauma labeled \\"shell shock\\" (eventually to be termed posttraumatic stress disorder) that were best treated as soon as possible.[10] Because physicians (including psychiatrists) were over-extended in treating bodily injuries, psychologists were called to help treat this condition.[15] At the same time, female psychologists (who were excluded from the war effort) formed the National Council of Women Psychologists with the purpose of helping communities deal with the stresses of war and giving young mothers advice on child rearing.[11] After the war, the Veterans Administration in the U.S. made an enormous investment to set up programs to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists to help treat the thousands of veterans needing care. As a consequence, the U.S. went from having no formal university programs in clinical psychology in 1946 to over half of all Ph.D.s in psychology in 1950 being awarded in clinical psychology.[11]\\r\\nWWII helped bring dramatic changes to clinical psychology, not just in America but internationally as well. Graduate education in psychology began adding psychotherapy to the science and research focus based on the 1947 scientist-practitioner model, known today as the Boulder Model, for Ph.D. programs in clinical psychology.[16] Clinical psychology in Britain developed much like in the U.S. after WWII, specifically within the context of the National Health Service[17] with qualifications, standards, and salaries managed by the British Psychological Society.[18]\\r\\nBy the 1960s, psychotherapy had become imbedded within clinical psychology, but for many the Ph.D. educational model did not offer the necessary training for those interested in practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the U.S. had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. The concept of a practice-oriented degree was debated in 1965 and narrowly gained approval for a pilot program at the University of Illinois starting in 1968.[19] Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the Vail Conference on Professional Training in Psychology, the practitionerÿscholar model of clinical psychologyor Vail Modelresulting in the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) degree was recognized.[20] Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. The first program explicitly based on the Psy.D. model was instituted at Rutgers University.[19] Today, about half of all American graduate students in clinical psychology are enrolled in Psy.D. programs.[20]\\r\\nSince the 1970s, clinical psychology has continued growing into a robust profession and academic field of study. Although the exact number of practicing clinical psychologists is unknown, it is estimated that between 1974 and 1990, the number in the U.S. grew from 20,000 to 63,000.[21] Clinical psychologists continue to be experts in assessment and psychotherapy while expanding their focus to address issues of gerontology, sports, and the criminal justice system to name a few. One important field is health psychology, the fastest-growing employment setting for clinical psychologists in the past decade.[9] Other major changes include the impact of managed care on mental health care; an increasing realization of the importance of knowledge relating to multicultural and diverse populations; and emerging privileges to prescribe psychotropic medication.\\r\\nClinical psychologists engage in a wide range of activities. Some focus solely on research into the assessment, treatment, or cause of mental illness and related conditions. Some teach, whether in a medical school or hospital setting, or in an academic department (e.g., psychology department) at an institution of higher education. The majority of clinical psychologists engage in some form of clinical practice, with professional services including psychological assessment, provision of psychotherapy, development and administration of clinical programs, and forensics (e.g., providing expert testimony in a legal proceeding.[11]\\r\\nIn clinical practice, clinical psychologists may work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, mental health organizations, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies. Clinical psychologists who provide clinical services may also choose to specialize. Some specializations are codified and credentialed by regulatory agencies within the country of practice.[22] In the United States such specializations are credentialed by the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP).\\r\\nClinical psychologists study a generalist program in psychology plus postgraduate training and/or clinical placement and supervision. The length of training differs across the world, ranging from four years plus post-Bachelors supervised practice[23] to a doctorate of three to six years which combines clinical placement.[24] In the USA, about half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in Ph.D. programsa model that emphasizes researchwith the other half in Psy.D. programs, which has more focus on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law).[20] Both models are accredited by the American Psychological Association[25] and many other English-speaking psychological societies. A smaller number of schools offer accredited programs in clinical psychology resulting in a Masters degree, which usually take two to three years post-Bachelors.\\r\\nIn the U.K., clinical psychologists undertake a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (D.Clin.Psych.), which is a practitioner doctorate with both clinical and research components. This is a three-year full-time salaried program sponsored by the National Health Service (NHS) and based in universities and the NHS. Entry into these programs is highly competitive, and requires at least a three-year undergraduate degree in psychology plus some form of experience, usually in either the NHS as an Assistant Psychologist or in academia as a Research Assistant. It is not unusual for applicants to apply several times before being accepted onto a training course as only about one-fifth of applicants are accepted each year.[26] These clinical psychology doctoral degrees are accredited by the British Psychological Society and the Health Professions Council (HPC). The HPC is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the UK. Those who successfully complete clinical psychology doctoral degrees are eligible to apply for registration with the HPC as a clinical psychologist.\\r\\nThe practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. Although each of the U.S. states is somewhat different in terms of requirements and licenses, there are three common elements:[27]\\r\\nAll U.S. state and Canadian province licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). Many states require other examinations in addition to the EPPP, such as a jurisprudence (i.e. mental health law) examination and/or an oral examination.[27] Most states also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year in order to renew a license, which can be obtained though various means, such as taking audited classes and attending approved workshops. Clinical psychologists require the Psychologist license to practice, although licenses can be obtained with a masters-level degree, such as Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), and Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA).[28]\\r\\nIn the U.K. registration as a clinical psychologist with the Health Professions Council (HPC) is necessary. The HPC is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the U.K. In the U.K. the following titles are restricted by law \\"registered psychologist\\" and \\"practitioner psychologist\\"; in addition the specialist title \\"clinical psychologist\\" is also restricted by law.\\r\\nAn important area of expertise for many clinical psychologists is psychological assessment, and there are indications that as many as 91% of psychologists engage in this core clinical practice.[29] Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming hypotheses about psychological or behavioral problems. As such, the results of such assessments are usually used to create generalized impressions (rather than diagnoses) in service to informing treatment planning. Methods include formal testing measures, interviews, reviewing past records, clinical observation, and physical examination.[2]\\r\\nThere exist hundreds of various assessment tools, although only a few have been shown to have both high validity (i.e., test actually measures what it claims to measure) and reliability (i.e., consistency). These measures generally fall within one of several categories, including the following:\\r\\nAfter assessment, clinical psychologists often provide a diagnostic impression.[citation needed] Many countries use the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) while the U.S. most often uses the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Both are nosological systems that largely assume categorical disorders diagnosed through the application of sets of criteria including symptoms and signs.[30]\\r\\nSeveral new models are being discussed, including a \\"dimensional model\\" based on empirically validated models of human differences (such as the five factor model of personality[30][31]) and a \\"psychosocial model\\", which would take changing, intersubjective states into greater account.[32] The proponents of these models claim that they would offer greater diagnostic flexibility and clinical utility without depending on the medical concept of illness.[citation needed] However, they also admit that these models are not yet robust enough to gain widespread use, and should continue to be developed.[citation needed]\\r\\nClinical psychologists do not tend to diagnose, but rather use formulationan individualized map of the difficulties that the patient or client faces, encompassing predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating (maintaining) factors.[33]\\r\\nClinical assessment can be characterized as a prediction problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior.[34] For example, many therapy decisions are made on the basis of what a clinician expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. Once observations have been collected (e.g., psychological test results, diagnostic impressions, clinical history, X-ray, etc.), there are two mutually exclusive ways to combine those sources of information to arrive at a decision, diagnosis, or prediction. One way is to combine the data in an algorithmic, or \\"mechanical\\" fashion. Mechanical prediction methods are simply a mode of combination of data to arrive at a decision/prediction of behavior (e.g., treatment response). Mechanical prediction does not preclude any type of data from being combined; it can incorporate clinical judgments, properly coded, in the algorithm.[34] The defining characteristic is that, once the data to be combined is given, the mechanical approach will make a prediction that is 100% reliable. That is, it will make exactly the same prediction for exactly the same data every time. Clinical prediction, on the other hand, does not guarantee this, as it depends on the decision-making processes of the clinician making the judgment, their current state of mind, and knowledge base.[35] [34]\\r\\nWhat has come to be called the \\"clinical versus statistical prediction\\" debate was first described in detail in 1954 by Paul Meehl,[35] where he explored the claim that mechanical (formal, algorithmic) methods of data combination could outperform clinical (e.g., subjective, informal, \\"in the clinician's head\\") methods when such combinations are used to arrive at a prediction of behavior. Meehl concluded that mechanical modes of combination performed as well or better than clinical modes.[36] Subsequent meta-analyses of studies that directly compare mechanical and clinical predictions have born out Meehl's 1954 conclusions.[37][38] A 2009 survey of practicing clinical psychologists found that clinicians almost exclusively use their clinical judgment to make behavioral predictions for their patients, including diagnosis and prognosis.[39]\\r\\nPsychotherapy involves a formal relationship between professional and clientusually an individual, couple, family, or small groupthat employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving.[2][40]\\r\\nClinicians have a wide range of individual interventions to draw from, often guided by their trainingfor example, a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) clinician might use worksheets to record distressing cognitions, a psychoanalyst might encourage free association, while a psychologist trained in Gestalt techniques might focus on immediate interactions between client and therapist. Clinical psychologists generally seek to base their work on research evidence and outcome studies as well as on trained clinical judgment. Although there are literally dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session.[11]\\r\\nThe methods used are also different in regards to the population being served as well as the context and nature of the problem. Therapy will look very different between, say, a traumatized child, a depressed but high-functioning adult, a group of people recovering from substance dependence, and a ward of the state suffering from terrifying delusions. Other elements that play a critical role in the process of psychotherapy include the environment, culture, age, cognitive functioning, motivation, and duration (i.e. brief or long-term therapy).[40][41]\\r\\nMany clinical psychologists are integrative or eclectic and draw from the evidence base across different models of therapy in an integrative way, rather than using a single specific model.\\r\\nIn the UK, clinical psychologists have to show competence in at least two models of therapy, including CBT, to gain their doctorate. The British Psychological Society Division of Clinical Psychology has been vocal about the need to follow the evidence base rather than being wedded to a single model of therapy.\\r\\nIn the USA, intervention applications and research are dominated in training and practice by essentially four major schools of practice: psychodynamic, humanistic, behavioral/cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy.[2]\\r\\nThe psychodynamic perspective developed out of the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud. The core object of psychoanalysis is to make the unconscious consciousto make the client aware of his or her own primal drives (namely those relating to sex and aggression) and the various defenses used to keep them in check.[40] The essential tools of the psychoanalytic process are the use of free association and an examination of the client's transference towards the therapist, defined as the tendency to take unconscious thoughts or emotions about a significant person (e.g. a parent) and \\"transfer\\" them onto another person. Major variations on Freudian psychoanalysis practiced today include self psychology, ego psychology, and object relations theory. These general orientations now fall under the umbrella term psychodynamic psychology, with common themes including examination of transference and defenses, an appreciation of the power of the unconscious, and a focus on how early developments in childhood have shaped the client's current psychological state.[40]\\r\\nHumanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the person-centered therapy of Carl Rogers (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy) and existential psychology developed by Viktor Frankl and Rollo May.[2] Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvementcongruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding.[42] By using phenomenology, intersubjectivity and first-person categories, the humanistic approach seeks to get a glimpse of the whole person and not just the fragmented parts of the personality.[43] This aspect of holism links up with another common aim of humanistic practice in clinical psychology, which is to seek an integration of the whole person, also called self-actualization. From 1980, Hans-Werner Gessmann integrated the ideas of humanistic psychology into group psychotherapy as humanistic psychodrama. [44] According to humanistic thinking,[45] each individual person already has inbuilt potentials and resources that might help them to build a stronger personality and self-concept. The mission of the humanistic psychologist is to help the individual employ these resources via the therapeutic relationship.\\r\\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) developed from the combination of cognitive therapy and rational emotive behavior therapy, both of which grew out of cognitive psychology and behaviorism. CBT is based on the theory that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion), and how we act (behavior) are related and interact together in complex ways. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through schemas or beliefs) can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of many cognitive behavioral therapies is to discover and identify the biased, dysfunctional ways of relating or reacting and through different methodologies help clients transcend these in ways that will lead to increased well-being.[46] There are many techniques used, such as systematic desensitization, socratic questioning, and keeping a cognition observation log. Modified approaches that fall into the category of CBT have also developed, including dialectic behavior therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.[47]\\r\\nBehavior therapy is a rich tradition. It is well researched with a strong evidence base. Its roots are in behaviorism. In behavior therapy, environmental events predict the way we think and feel. Our behavior sets up conditions for the environment to feedback back on it. Sometimes the feedback leads the behavior to increase- reinforcement and sometimes the behavior decreases- punishment. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called applied behavior analysis. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to depression and anxiety disorders. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning.[48] Multiple assessment techniques have come from this approach including functional analysis (psychology), which has found a strong focus in the school system. In addition, multiple intervention programs have come from this tradition including community reinforcement approach for treating addictions, acceptance and commitment therapy, functional analytic psychotherapy, including dialectic behavior therapy and behavioral activation. In addition, specific techniques such as contingency management and exposure therapy have come from this tradition.\\r\\nSystems or family therapy works with couples and families, and emphasizes family relationships as an important factor in psychological health. The central focus tends to be on interpersonal dynamics, especially in terms of how change in one person will affect the entire system.[49] Therapy is therefore conducted with as many significant members of the \\"system\\" as possible. Goals can include improving communication, establishing healthy roles, creating alternative narratives, and addressing problematic behaviors.\\r\\nThere exist dozens of recognized schools or orientations of psychotherapythe list below represents a few influential orientations not given above. Although they all have some typical set of techniques practitioners employ, they are generally better known for providing a framework of theory and philosophy that guides a therapist in his or her working with a client.\\r\\nIn the last couple of decades, there has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of cultural, gender, spiritual, and sexual-orientation issues. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as neuroscience, behavioral genetics, evolutionary biology, and psychopharmacology. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.[62]\\r\\nThe field of clinical psychology in most countries is strongly regulated by a code of ethics. In the U.S., professional ethics are largely defined by the APA Code of Conduct, which is often used by states to define licensing requirements. The APA Code generally sets a higher standard than that which is required by law as it is designed to guide responsible behavior, the protection of clients, and the improvement of individuals, organizations, and society.[63] The Code is applicable to all psychologists in both research and applied fields.\\r\\nThe APA Code is based on five principles: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence, Fidelity and Responsibility, Integrity, Justice, and Respect for People's Rights and Dignity.[63] Detailed elements address how to resolve ethical issues, competence, human relations, privacy and confidentiality, advertising, record keeping, fees, training, research, publication, assessment, and therapy.\\r\\nIn the UK the British Psychological Society has published a Code of Conduct and Ethics for clinical psychologists. This has four key areas: Respect, Competence, Responsibility and Integrity.[64] Other European professional organisations have similar codes of conduct and ethics.\\r\\nAlthough clinical psychologists and psychiatrists can be said to share a same fundamental aimthe alleviation of mental distresstheir training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the medical model to assess psychological problems (i.e., those they treat are seen as patients with an illness) and rely on psychotropic medications as the chief method of addressing the illness[65]although many also employ psychotherapy as well. Psychiatrists and medical psychologists (who are clinical psychologists that are also licensed to prescribe) are able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and EEGs, and may order brain imaging studies such as CT or CAT, MRI, and PET scanning.\\r\\nClinical psychologists generally do not prescribe medication, although there is a growing movement for psychologists to have prescribing privileges.[66] These medical privileges require additional training and education. To date, medical psychologists may prescribe psychotropic medications in Guam, New Mexico, and Louisiana and military psychologists.[67]\\r\\nCounseling psychologists study and use many of the same interventions and tools as clinical psychologists, including psychotherapy and assessment. Traditionally, counseling psychologists help people with what might be considered normal or moderate psychological problemssuch as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events.[3][11] Many counseling psychologists also receive specialized training in career assessment, group therapy, and relationship counseling, although some counseling psychologists also work with the more serious problems that clinical psychologists are trained for, such as dementia or psychosis.\\r\\nThere are fewer counseling psychology graduate programs than those for clinical psychology and they are more often housed in departments of education rather than psychology. The two professions can be found working in all the same settings but counseling psychologists are more frequently employed in university counseling centers compared to hospitals and private practice for clinical psychologists.[68] There is considerable overlap between the two fields and distinctions between them continue to fade.\\r\\nSchool psychologists are primarily concerned with the academic, social, and emotional well-being of children and adolescents within a scholastic environment. In the U.K., they are known as \\"educational psychologists\\". Like clinical (and counseling) psychologists, school psychologists with doctoral degrees are eligible for licensure as health service psychologists, and many work in private practice. Unlike clinical psychologists, they receive much more training in education, child development and behavior, and the psychology of learning. Common degrees include the Educational Specialist Degree (Ed.S.), Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), and Doctor of Education (Ed.D.).\\r\\nTraditional job roles for school psychologists employed in school settings have focused mainly on assessment of students to determine their eligibility for special education services in schools, and on consultation with teachers and other school professionals to design and carry out interventions on behalf of students. Other major roles also include offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, designing prevention programs (e.g. for reducing dropout), evaluating school programs, and working with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both in the classroom and systemically.[75][76]\\r\\nSocial workers provide a variety of services, generally concerned with social problems, their causes, and their solutions. With specific training, clinical social workers may also provide psychological counseling (in the U.S. and Canada), in addition to more traditional social work. The Masters in Social Work in the U.S. is a two-year, sixty credit program that includes at least a one-year practicum (two years for clinicians).[77]\\r\\nOccupational therapyoften abbreviated OTis the \\"use of productive or creative activity in the treatment or rehabilitation of physically, cognitively, or emotionally disabled people.\\"[78] Most commonly, occupational therapists work with people with disabilities to enable them to maximize their skills and abilities. Occupational therapy practitioners are skilled professionals whose education includes the study of human growth and development with specific emphasis on the physical, emotional, psychological, sociocultural, cognitive and environmental components of illness and injury. They commonly work alongside clinical psychologists in settings such as inpatient and outpatient mental health, pain management clinics, eating disorder clinics, and child development services. OT's use support groups, individual counseling sessions, and activity-based approaches to address psychiatric symptoms and maximize functioning in life activities.\\r\\nClinical psychology is a diverse field and there have been recurring tensions over the degree to which clinical practice should be limited to treatments supported by empirical research.[79] Despite some evidence showing that all the major therapeutic orientations are about of equal effectiveness,[80][81] there remains much debate about the efficacy of various forms treatment in use in clinical psychology.[82]\\r\\nIt has been reported that clinical psychology has rarely allied itself with client groups and tends to individualize problems to the neglect of wider economic, political and social inequality issues that may not be the responsibility of the client.[79] It has been argued that therapeutic practices are inevitably bound up with power inequalities, which can be used for good and bad.[83] A critical psychology movement has argued that clinical psychology, and other professions making up a \\"psy complex\\", often fail to consider or address inequalities and power differences and can play a part in the social and moral control of disadvantage, deviance and unrest.[84][85]\\r\\nAn October 2009 editorial in the journal Nature suggests that a large number of clinical psychology practitioners in the United States consider scientific evidence to be \\"less important than their personal ÿ that is, subjective ÿ clinical experience.\\"[86]","input":"What is the largest branch of psychology today?"},{"output":"586 BCE","context":"The Kingdom of Judah (Hebrew: ????????? ?????????, Mamlekhet Yehudh) was an Iron Age kingdom of the Southern Levant. The Hebrew Bible depicts it as the successor to a United Monarchy, but historians are divided about the veracity of this account. In the 10th and early 9th centuries BCE, the territory of Judah appears to have been sparsely populated, limited to small rural settlements, most of them unfortified.[9] Jerusalem, the kingdom's capital, likely did not emerge as a significant administrative center until the end of the 8th century; before this the archaeological evidence suggests its population was too small to sustain a viable kingdom.[10] In the 7th century its population increased greatly, prospering under Assyrian vassalage (despite Hezekiah's revolt against the Assyrian king Sennacherib[11]), but in 605 the Assyrian Empire was defeated, and the ensuing competition between the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt and the Neo-Babylonian Empire for control of the Eastern Mediterranean led to the destruction of the kingdom in a series of campaigns between 597 and 582, the deportation of the elite of the community, and the incorporation of Judah into a province of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant academic debate exists around the character of the Kingdom of Judah. Little archaeological evidence of an extensive, powerful Kingdom of Judah before the late 8th century BCE has been found; Nimrud Tablet K.3751, dated c. 733 BCE, is the earliest known record of the name Judah (written in Assyrian cuneiform as Yaudaya or KUR.ia-~-da-a-a).[13]\\r\\nArchaeologists of the minimalist school doubt the extent of the Kingdom of Judah as depicted in the Bible. Around 1990ÿ2010, an important group of archaeologists and biblical scholars formed the view that the actual Kingdom of Judah bore little resemblance to the biblical portrait of a powerful monarchy. These scholars say the kingdom was no more than a small tribal entity.[14][15]\\r\\nHowever, Yosef Garfinkel has written in a preliminary report published by the Israeli Antiquities Authority that finds at the Khirbet Qeiyafa site support the notion that an urban society already existed in Judah in the late 11th century BCE.[16] Other archaeologists say that the identification of Khirbet Qeiyafa as an Israelite settlement is uncertain.[17][18]\\r\\nThe status of Jerusalem in the 10th century BCE is a major subject of debate.[9] The oldest part of Jerusalem and its original urban core is the City of David, which does not show evidence of significant Israelite residential activity until the 9th century.[19] However, unique administrative structures such as the Stepped Stone Structure and the Large Stone Structure, which originally formed one structure, contain material culture dated to Iron I.[9] On account of the apparent lack of settlement activity in the 10th century BCE, Israel Finkelstein argues that Jerusalem in the century was a small country village in the Judean hills, not a national capital, and Ussishkin argues that the city was entirely uninhabited. Amihai Mazar contends that if the Iron I/Iron IIa dating of administrative structures in the City of David are correct, (as he believes) \\"Jerusalem was a rather small town with a mighty citadel, which could have been a center of a substantial regional polity.\\"[9]\\r\\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the kingdom of Judah resulted from the break-up of the United kingdom of Israel (1020 to about 930 BCE) after the northern tribes refused to accept Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, as their king. At first, only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David, but soon after the tribe of Benjamin joined Judah. The two kingdoms, Judah in the south and Israel in the north, coexisted uneasily after the split until the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel by Assyria in c. 722/721.\\r\\nThe major theme of the Hebrew Bible's narrative is the loyalty of Judah, and especially its kings, to Yahweh, which it states is the God of Israel. Accordingly, all the kings of Israel and almost all the kings of Judah were \\"bad\\", which in terms of Biblical narrative means that they failed to enforce monotheism. Of the \\"good\\" kings, Hezekiah (727ÿ698 BCE) is noted for his efforts at stamping out idolatry (in this case, the worship of Baal and Asherah, among other traditional Near Eastern divinities),[20] but his successors, Manasseh of Judah (698ÿ642 BCE) and Amon (642ÿ640 BCE), revived idolatry, drawing down on the kingdom the anger of Yahweh. King Josiah (640ÿ609 BCE) returned to the worship of Yahweh alone, but his efforts were too late and Israel's unfaithfulness caused God to permit the kingdom's destruction by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the Siege of Jerusalem (587 BCE).\\r\\nHowever it is now fairly well established among academic scholars that the Biblical narrative is not an accurate reflection of religious views in either Judah or particularly Israel during this period.[21]\\r\\nFor the first sixty years, the kings of Judah tried to re-establish their authority over the northern kingdom, and there was perpetual war between them. Israel and Judah were in a state of war throughout Rehoboam's seventeen-year reign. Rehoboam built elaborate defenses and strongholds, along with fortified cities. In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, pharaoh of Egypt, brought a huge army and took many cities. In the sack of Jerusalem (10th century BCE), Rehoboam gave them all of the treasures out of the temple as a tribute and Judah became a vassal state of Egypt.\\r\\nRehoboam's son and successor, Abijah of Judah continued his father's efforts to bring Israel under his control. He fought the Battle of Mount Zemaraim against Jeroboam of Israel and was victorious with a heavy loss of life on the Israel side. According to the books of Chronicles, Abijah and his people defeated them with a great slaughter, so that 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain[22] after which Jeroboam posed little threat to Judah for the rest of his reign and the border of the tribe of Benjamin was restored to the original tribal border.[23]\\r\\nAbijah's son and successor, Asa of Judah, maintained peace for the first 35 years of his reign,[24] during which time he revamped and reinforced the fortresses originally built by his grandfather, Rehoboam. 2 Chronicles states that at the Battle of Zephath, the Egyptian-backed chieftain Zerah the Ethiopian and his million men and 300 chariots was defeated by Asa's 580,000 men in the Valley of Zephath near Maresha.[25] The Bible does not state whether Zerah was a pharaoh or a general of the army. The Ethiopians were pursued all the way to Gerar, in the coastal plain, where they stopped out of sheer exhaustion. The resulting peace kept Judah free from Egyptian incursions until the time of Josiah some centuries later.\\r\\nIn his 36th year, Asa was confronted by Baasha of Israel,[24] who built a fortress at Ramah on the border, less than ten miles from Jerusalem. The result was that the capital was under pressure and the military situation was precarious. Asa took gold and silver from the Temple and sent them to Ben-Hadad I, king of Aram-Damascus, in exchange for the Damascene king canceling his peace treaty with Baasha. Ben-Hadad attacked Ijon, Dan, and many important cities of the tribe of Naphtali, and Baasha was forced to withdraw from Ramah.[26] Asa tore down the unfinished fortress and used its raw materials to fortify Geba and Mizpah in Benjamin on his side of the border.[27]\\r\\nAsa's successor, Jehoshaphat, changed the policy towards Israel and instead pursued alliances and co-operation with the northern kingdom. The alliance with Ahab was based on marriage. This alliance led to disaster for the kingdom with the battle of Ramoth-Gilead.[28] He then entered into an alliance with Ahaziah of Israel for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with Ophir. But the fleet that was then equipped at Ezion-Geber was immediately wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the cooperation of the king of Israel, and although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted.[29] He subsequently joined Jehoram of Israel in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful, with the Moabites being subdued. However, on seeing Mesha's act of offering his own son in a human sacrifice on the walls of Kir-haresheth filled Jehoshaphat with horror and he withdrew and returned to his own land.[30]\\r\\nJehoshaphat's successor, Jehoram of Judah formed an alliance with Israel by marrying Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab. Despite this alliance with the stronger northern kingdom, Jehoram's rule of Judah was shaky. Edom revolted, and he was forced to acknowledge their independence. A raid by Philistines, Arabs and Ethiopians looted the king's house and carried off all of his family except for his youngest son, Ahaziah of Judah.\\r\\nAfter Hezekiah became sole ruler in c. 715 BCE, he formed alliances with Ashkelon and Egypt, and made a stand against Assyria by refusing to pay tribute.[31] (Isaiah 30ÿ31; 36:6ÿ9) In response, Sennacherib of Assyria attacked the fortified cities of Judah. (2 Kings 18:13) Hezekiah paid three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold to Assyria ÿ requiring him to empty the temple and royal treasury of silver and strip the gold from the doorposts of Solomon's Temple. (2 Kings 18:14ÿ16)[31] However, Sennacherib besieged Jerusalem[32] (2 Kings 18:17) in 701 BCE, though the city was never taken.\\r\\nDuring the long reign of Manasseh (c. 687/686 ÿ 643/642 BCE),[33] Judah was a vassal of Assyrian rulers ÿ Sennacherib and his successors, Esarhaddon[34] and Ashurbanipal after 669 BCE. Manasseh is listed as being required to provide materials for Esarhaddon's building projects, and as one of a number of vassals who assisted Ashurbanipal's campaign against Egypt.[34]\\r\\nWhen Josiah became king of Judah in c. 641/640 BCE,[33] the international situation was in flux. To the east, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate, the Neo-Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it, and Egypt to the west was still recovering from Assyrian rule. In this power vacuum, Judah was able to govern itself for the time being without foreign intervention. However, in the spring of 609 BCE, Pharaoh Necho II personally led a sizable army up to the Euphrates to aid the Assyrians.[35] Taking the coast route Via Maris into Syria at the head of a large army, Necho passed the low tracts of Philistia and Sharon. However, the passage over the ridge of hills which shuts in on the south of the great Jezreel Valley was blocked by the Judean army led by Josiah, who may have considered that the Assyrians and Egyptians were weakened by the death of the pharaoh Psamtik I only a year earlier (610 BCE).[35] Presumably in an attempt to help the Babylonians, Josiah attempted to block the advance at Megiddo, where a fierce battle was fought and where Josiah was killed.[36] Necho then joined forces with the Assyrian Ashur-uballit II and together they crossed the Euphrates and lay siege to Harran. The combined forces failed to capture the city, and Necho retreated back to northern Syria. The event also marked the disintegration of the Assyrian Empire.\\r\\nOn his return march to Egypt in 608 BCE, Necho found that Jehoahaz had been selected to succeed his father, Josiah.[37] Necho deposed Jehoahaz, who had been king for only three months, and replaced him with his older brother, Jehoiakim. Necho imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver (about 3?3?4 tons or about 3.4 metric tons) and a talent of gold (about 34 kilograms (75?lb)). Necho then took Jehoahaz back to Egypt as his prisoner,[38] never to return.\\r\\nJehoiakim ruled originally as a vassal of the Egyptians, paying a heavy tribute. However, when the Egyptians were defeated by the Babylonians at Carchemish in 605 BCE, Jehoiakim changed allegiances, paying tribute to Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. In 601 BCE, in the fourth year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar unsuccessfully attempted to invade Egypt and was repulsed with heavy losses. This failure led to numerous rebellions among the states of the Levant which owed allegiance to Babylon. Jehoiakim also stopped paying tribute to Nebuchadnezzar[39] and took a pro-Egyptian position. Nebuchadnezzar soon dealt with these rebellions. According to the Babylonian Chronicles, after invading \\"the land of Hatti (Syria/Palestine)\\"[40][41] in 599 BCE, he lay siege to Jerusalem. Jehoiakim died in 598 BCE[42] during the siege, and was succeeded by his son Jeconiah at an age of either eight or eighteen.[43] The city fell about three months later,[44][45] on 2 Adar (March 16) 597 BCE. Nebuchadnezzar pillaged both Jerusalem and the Temple, carting all his spoils to Babylon. Jeconiah and his court and other prominent citizens and craftsmen, along with a sizable portion of the Jewish population of Judah, numbering about 10,000[46] were deported from the land and dispersed throughout the Babylonian Empire. (2 Kings 24:14) Among them was Ezekiel. Nebuchadnezzar appointed Zedekiah, Jehoiakim's brother, king of the reduced kingdom, who was made a tributary of Babylon.\\r\\nDespite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, Zedekiah revolted against Nebuchadnezzar, ceasing to pay tribute to him and entered into an alliance with Pharaoh Hophra. In 589 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II returned to Judah and again besieged Jerusalem. During this period, many Jews fled to surrounding Moab, Ammon, Edom and other countries to seek refuge.[47] The city fell after a siege which lasted either eighteen or thirty months[48] and Nebuchadnezzar again pillaged both Jerusalem and the Temple,[49] after which he destroyed them both.[50] After killing all of Zedekiah's sons, with the possible exception of one,[51] Nebuchadnezzar took Zedekiah to Babylon,[52] putting an end to the independent Kingdom of Judah. According to the Book of Jeremiah, in addition to those killed during the siege, some 4,600 people were deported after the fall of Judah.[53] By 586 BCE much of Judah was devastated, and the former kingdom suffered a steep decline of both economy and population.[54]\\r\\nJerusalem apparently remained uninhabited for much of the 6th century,[54] and the centre of gravity shifted to Benjamin, the relatively unscathed northern section of the kingdom, where the town of Mizpah became the capital of the new Babylonian province of Yehud for the remnant of the Jewish population in a part of the former kingdom.[55] This was standard Babylonian practice: when the Philistine city of Ashkelon was conquered in 604 BCE, the political, religious and economic elite (but not the bulk of the population) was banished and the administrative centre shifted to a new location.[56]\\r\\nGedaliah was appointed governor of the Yehud Medinata, supported by a Babylonian guard. The administrative centre of the province was Mizpah in Benjamin,[57] not Jerusalem. On hearing of the appointment, many of the Judeans that had taken refuge in surrounding countries were persuaded to return to Judah.[58] However, before long Gedaliah was assassinated by a member of the royal house, and the Chaldean soldiers killed. The population that was left in the land and those that had returned fled to Egypt fearing a Babylonian reprisal, under the leadership of Yohanan ben Kareah, ignoring the urging of the prophet Jeremiah against the move. (2 Kings 25:26, Jeremiah 43:5ÿ7) In Egypt, the refugees settled in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and Pathros, (Jeremiah 44:1) and Jeremiah went with them as a moral guardian.\\r\\nThe numbers that were deported to Babylon and those who made their way to Egypt and the remnant that remained in the land and in surrounding countries is subject to academic debate. The Book of Jeremiah reports that 4600 were exiled to Babylonia.[53] The Books of Kings suggest that it was ten thousand, and later eight thousand.\\r\\nIn 539 BCE the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylonia and allowed the exiles to return to Yehud Medinata and rebuild the Temple, which was completed in the sixth year of Darius (515 BCE) (Ezra 6:15) under Zerubbabel, the grandson of the second to last king of Judah, Jeconiah. Yehud Medinata was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great.","input":"When was the southern kingdom of judah destroyed?"},{"output":"Western Nigeria Television Service (WNTS)","context":"The first terrestrial television broadcast signals in Africa occurred on Saturday October 31, 1959 and belonged to the Western Nigeria Television Service (WNTS).

His technique saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town and was adopted by surgeons in Britain and the United States.[4] In 1955, he travelled to the United States and was initially assigned further gastrointestinal work by Owen Harding Wangensteen.[5] He was introduced to the heart-lung machine, and Barnard was allowed to transfer to the service run by open heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei.[6] Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at the Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town.[7]\\r\\nOn 3 December 1967, Barnard transplanted the heart of Denise Darvall, who had just died from a head injury, into the chest of a 54-year-old Louis Washkansky. Washkansky regained full consciousness and lived for eighteen days, even spending time with his wife, before he died of pneumonia, with the suppression of his immune system by the anti-rejection drugs being a major contributing factor.[3][8] Barnard had told Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, a claim which has been criticised as misleading.[9][10][11]\\r\\nBarnard's second transplant patient Philip Blaiberg, with the operation performed at the beginning of 1968, lived for nineteen months and was able to go home from the hospital.[3][12]\\r\\nHe retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing rheumatoid arthritis in his hands which ended his surgical career. He became interested in anti-aging research, and in 1986 his reputation suffered when he promoted Glycel, an expensive \\"anti-aging\\" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter. During his remaining years, he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world. He died in 2001 at the age of 78 after an asthma attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBarnard grew up in Beaufort West, Cape Province, Union of South Africa. His father, Adam Barnard, was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church.[2] One of his four brothers, Abraham, was a \\"blue baby\\" who died of a heart problem at the age of three (Barnard would later guess that it was tetralogy of Fallot). The family also experienced the loss of a daughter who was stillborn and who had been the fraternal twin of Barnard's older brother Johannes, who was twelve years older than Chris.[13] Barnard matriculated from the Beaufort West High School in 1940, and went to study medicine at the University of Cape Town Medical School, where he obtained his MB ChB in 1945.\\r\\nHis father served as a missionary to mixed-race peoples. His mother, the former Maria Elisabeth de Swart, instilled in the surviving brothers the belief that they could do anything they set their minds to.[3]\\r\\nBarnard did his internship and residency at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, after which he worked as a general practitioner in Ceres, a rural town in the Cape Province.[2] In 1951, he returned to Cape Town where he worked at the City Hospital as a Senior Resident Medical Officer, and in the Department of Medicine at the Groote Schuur Hospital as a registrar.[2] He completed his master's degree, receiving Master of Medicine in 1953 from the University of Cape Town. In the same year he obtained a doctorate in medicine (MD) from the same university for a dissertation titled \\"The treatment of tuberculous meningitis\\".\\r\\nSoon after qualifying as a doctor, Barnard performed experiments on dogs investigating intestinal atresia, a birth defect which allows life-threatening gaps to develop in the intestines. He followed a medical hunch that this was caused by inadequate blood flow to the fetus. After nine months and forty-three attempts, Barnard was able to reproduce this condition in a fetus puppy by tying off some of the blood supply to a puppy's intestines and then placing the animal back in the womb, after which it was born some two weeks later, with the condition of intestinal atresia. He was also able to cure the condition by removing the piece of intestine with inadequate blood supply. The mistake of previous surgeons had been attempting to reconnect ends of intestine which themselves still had inadequate blood supply. To be successful, it was typically necessary to remove between 15 and 20 centimeters of intestine (6 to 8 inches). Jannie Louw used this innovation in a clinical setting, and Barnard's method saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town. This technique was also adapted by surgeons in Britain and the US. In addition, Barnard analyzed 259 cases of tubercular meningitis.[4]\\r\\nOwen Wangensteen in Minnesota had been impressed by the work of Alan Thal, a young South African doctor working in Minnesota. He asked Groote Schuur Head of Medicine John Brock if he might recommend any similarly talented South Africans and Brock recommended Barnard.[14] In December 1955, Barnard travelled to the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States, to begin a two-year scholarship under Chief of Surgery Wangensteen, who assigned Barnard more work on the intestines, which Barnard accepted even though he wanted to move onto something new.[5] Simply by luck, whenever Barnard needed a break from this work, he could wander across the hall and talk with Vince Gott who ran the lab for open-heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei. Gott had begun to develop a technique of running blood backwards through the veins of the heart so Lillehei could more easily operate on the aortic valve (McRae writes, \\"It was the type of inspired thinking that entranced Barnard\\"). In March 1956, Gott asked Barnard to help him run the heart-lung machine for an operation.[6] Shortly thereafter, Wangensteen agreed to let Barnard switch to Lillehei's service. It was during this time that Barnard first became acquainted with fellow future heart transplantation surgeon Norman Shumway.[15] Barnard also became friendly with Gil Campbell who had demonstrated that a dog's lung could be used to oxygenate blood during open-heart surgery. (The year before Barnard arrived, Lillehei and Campbell had used this procedure for twenty minutes during surgery on a 13-year-old boy with ventricular septal defect, and the boy had made a full recovery.) Barnard and Campbell met regularly for early breakfast.[16] In 1958, Barnard received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis titled \\"The aortic valve ÿ problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve\\".[2] The same year he was awarded a Ph.D. for his dissertation titled \\"The aetiology of congenital intestinal atresia\\".[2] Barnard described the two years he spent in the United States as \\"the most fascinating time in my life.\\"\\r\\nUpon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at Groote Schuur hospital, as well as holding a joint post at the University of Cape Town.[7][17] He was promoted to full-time lecturer and Director of Surgical Research at the University of Cape Town. In 1960, he flew to Moscow in order to meet Vladimir Demikhov, a top expert on organ transplants[18] (later he credited Demikhov's accomplishment saying that \\"if there is a father of heart and lung transplantation then Demikhov certainly deserves this title.\\")[19] In 1961 he was appointed Head of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the teaching hospitals of the University of Cape Town. He rose to the position of Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1962. Barnard's younger brother Marius, who also studied medicine, eventually became Barnard's right-hand man at the department of Cardiac Surgery.[2] Over time, Barnard became known as a brilliant surgeon with many contributions to the treatment of cardiac diseases, such as the Tetralogy of Fallot and Ebstein's anomaly. He was promoted to Professor of Surgical Science in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1972. In 1981, Barnard became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.[20] Among the many awards he received over the years, he was named Professor Emeritus in 1984.\\r\\nFollowing the first successful kidney transplant in 1953, in the United States, Barnard performed the second kidney transplant in South Africa in October 1967, the first being done in Johannesburg the previous year.[21][page?needed][22]\\r\\nOn 23 January 1964, James Hardy at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi, performed the world's first heart transplant and world's first cardiac xenotransplant by transplanting the heart of a chimpanzee into a desperately ill and dying man. This heart did beat in the patient's chest for approximately 60 to 90 minutes. The patient, Boyd Rush, died without ever regaining consciousness.[23][24][25][26][27][28]\\r\\nBarnard had experimentally transplanted forty-eight hearts into dogs, which was about a fifth the number that Adrian Kantrowitz had performed at Maimonides Medical Center in New York and about a sixth the number Norman Shumway had performed at Stanford University in California. Barnard had no dogs which had survived longer than ten days, unlike Kantrowitz and Shumway who had had dogs survive for more than a year.[29][30] [31]\\r\\nWith the availability of new breakthroughs introduced by several pioneers, also including Richard Lower at the Medical College of Virginia, several surgical teams were in a position to prepare for a human heart transplant.[2][32] Barnard had a patient willing to undergo the procedure, but as with other surgeons, he needed a suitable donor.[2][31]\\r\\nDuring the Apartheid era in South Africa, non-white persons and citizens were not given equal opportunities in the medical professions. At Groote Schuur Hospital, Hamilton Naki was an informally taught surgeon. He started out as a gardener and cleaner. One day he was asked to help out with an experiment on a giraffe. From this modest beginning, Naki became principal lab technician and taught hundreds[33] of surgeons, and assisted with Barnard's organ transplant program. Barnard said, \\"Hamilton Naki had better technical skills than I did. He was a better craftsman than me, especially when it came to stitching, and had very good hands in the theatre\\". A popular myth, propagated principally by a widely discredited documentary film called Hidden Heart[34][35][36][37] and an erroneous newspaper article[33] , maintains incorrectly that Naki was present during the Washkansky transplant.[38][33]\\r\\nBarnard performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant operation in the early morning hours of Sunday 3 December 1967.[1][3][39] Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old grocer who was suffering from diabetes and incurable heart disease, was the patient.[8][40] Barnard was assisted by his brother Marius Barnard, as well as a team of thirty persons. The operation lasted approximately five hours.[31][41][42][40]\\r\\nBarnard stated to Washkansky and his wife Ann Washkansky that the transplant had an 80% chance of success.[9][11][43] This has been criticised by the ethicists Peter Singer and Helga Kuhse as making claims for chances of success to the patient and family which were \\"unfounded\\" and \\"misleading\\".[10]\\r\\nBarnard later wrote, \\"For a dying man it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced you have a chance to swim to the other side.\\" The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town.[2] On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear.[44] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt.[45] The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins.[46] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard.[2] Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, \\"Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'\\"[2][31]\\r\\nWashkansky survived the operation and lived for 18 days, having succumbed to pneumonia as he was taking immunosuppressive drugs.\\r\\nBarnard was celebrated around the world for his accomplishment. He was photogenic, and enjoyed the media attention following the operation.\\r\\nWorldwide, approximately 100 transplants were performed by various doctors during 1968.[47] Only a third of these patients lived longer than three months. A U.S. National Institutes of Health publication states, \\"Within several years, only Shumway's team at Stanford was attempting transplants.\\"[32]\\r\\nBarnard's second transplant operation was conducted on 2 January 1968, and the patient, Philip Blaiberg, survived for 19 months.[3][12] Dirk van Zyl, who received a new heart in 1971, was the longest-lived recipient, surviving over 23 years.[48]\\r\\nBetween December 1967 and November 1974 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, ten heart transplants were performed, as well as a heart and lung transplant in 1971. Of these ten patients, four lived longer than 18 months, with two of these four becoming long-term survivors. One patient lived for over thirteen years and another for over twenty-four years.[49]\\r\\nFull recovery of donor heart function often takes place over hours or days, during which time considerable damage can occur. Other deaths to patients can occur from preexisting conditions. For example, in pulmonary hypertension the patient's right ventricle has often adapted to the higher pressure over time and, although diseased and hypertrophied, is often capable of maintaining circulation to the lungs. Barnard designed the idea of the heterotopic (or \\"piggy back\\" transplant) in which the patient's diseased heart is left in place while the donor heart is added, essentially forming a \\"double heart\\". Barnard performed the first such heterotopic heart transplant in 1974.[49][50]\\r\\nFrom November 1974 through December 1983, 49 consecutive heterotopic heart transplants on 43 patients were performed at Groote Schuur. The survival rate for patients at one year was over 60%, as compared to less than 40% with standard transplants, and the survival rate at five years was over 36% as compared to less than 20% with standard transplants.[49]\\r\\nMany surgeons gave up cardiac transplantation due to poor results, often due to rejection of the transplanted heart by the patient's immune system. Barnard persisted until the advent of cyclosporine, an effective immunosuppressive drug, which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He also attempted xenotransplantation in a human patient, while attempting to save the life of a girl who was unable to leave artificial life support after her second aortic valve replacement.\\r\\nBarnard was an outspoken opponent of South Africa's laws of apartheid, and was not afraid to criticise his nation's government, although he had to temper his remarks to some extent to travel abroad.[citation needed] Rather than leaving his homeland, he used his fame to campaign for a change in the law. Christiaan's brother, Marius Barnard, went into politics, and was elected to the legislature from Progressive Federal Party. Barnard later stated that the reason he never won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was probably because he was a \\"white South African\\".[51]\\r\\nShortly before his visit to Kenya in 1978, the following was written about his views regarding race relations in South Africa; \\"While he believes in the participation of Africans in the political process of South Africa, he is opposed to a one-man-one-vote system in South Africa\\".[52]\\r\\nIn answering a hypothetical question on how he would solve the race problem were he a \\"benevolent dictator in South Africa\\", Barnard stated the following in a long interview at the Weekly Review:[53]\\r\\nThe interview ended with the following summary from he himself; \\"I often say that, like King Lear, South Africa is a country more sinned against than sinning.\\"[53]\\r\\nBarnard's first marriage was to Aletta Gertruida Louw, a nurse, whom he married in 1948 while practising medicine in Ceres. The couple had two children? Deirdre (born 1950) and Andre (1951ÿ1984).[2][54] International fame took a toll on his personal life, and in 1969, Barnard and his wife divorced. In 1970, he married heiress Barbara Zoellner when she was 19, the same age as his son, and they had two children? Frederick (born 1972) and Christiaan Jr. (born 1974).[55] He divorced Zoellner in 1982.[55] Barnard married for a third time in 1988 to Karin Setzkorn, a young model.[55] They also had two children, Armin (born 1989) and Lara (born 1997), but this last marriage also ended in divorce in 2000.[55]\\r\\nBarnard described in his autobiography The Second Life a one-night extramarital affair with Italian film star Gina Lollobrigida,[2][56] that occurred in January 1968. During that visit to Rome he received an audience from Pope Paul VI.[57]\\r\\nIn October 2016, U.S. Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster (D-NH) stated that Barnard sexually assaulted her when she was 23 years old. According to Kuster, he attempted to grope her under her skirt, while seated at a business luncheon with Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-CA), whom she worked for at the time.[58][59][60]\\r\\nBarnard retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing rheumatoid arthritis in his hands which ended his surgical career. He had struggled with arthritis since 1956, when it was diagnosed during his postgraduate work in the United States.[2] After retirement, he spent two years as the Scientist-In-Residence at the Oklahoma Transplantation Institute in the United States and as an acting consultant for various institutions.[citation needed]\\r\\nHe had by this time become very interested in anti-aging research, and his reputation suffered in 1986 when he promoted Glycel, an expensive \\"anti-aging\\" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter.[3] He also spent time as a research advisor to the Clinique la Prairie, in Switzerland, where the controversial \\"rejuvenation therapy\\" was practised.[61]\\r\\nBarnard divided the remainder of his years between Austria, where he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world, and his game farm in Beaufort West, South Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\nChristiaan Barnard died on 2 September 2001, while on holiday in Paphos, Cyprus. Early reports stated that he had died of a heart attack, but an autopsy showed his death was caused by a severe asthma attack.[62]\\r\\nChristiaan Barnard wrote two autobiographies. His first book, One Life, was published in 1969 (ISBN?0245599525) and sold copies worldwide. Some of the proceeds were used to set up the Chris Barnard Fund for research into heart disease and heart transplants in Cape Town.[63] His second autobiography, The Second Life, was published in 1993, eight years before his death (ISBN?0947461388).\\r\\nApart from his autobiographies, Dr Barnard also wrote several other books including:[64]","input":"Where did the first human heart transplant happen?"},{"output":"ABV% content of 5.6.","context":"Mickey's is a malt liquor made by the Miller Brewing Company.[1] It has an ABV% content of 5.6.\\r\\nMickey's was originally brewed by Sterling Brewery in Evansville, Indiana from 1962 through 1972.[2] Mickey's is known for its beehive-shaped, wide-mouthed 12-ounce bottle, often called a grenade due to its circular waffle design.[3] The packaging is green in color with an image of a hornet on the label and the cap, and features rebus puzzles under the cap.[4][5] Recently, Mickey's has sponsored the Ultimate Fighting Championship, using the phrase, \\"Get Stung\\" and has featured several UFC fighters on 24 ounce cans.[6] Mickey's is also available in 16, 22, 24, 32, and 40 ounce sizes.","input":"What percent alcohol is mickey's malt liquor?"},{"output":"late 1984","context":"Air Jordan is a brand of basketball footwear and athletic clothing produced by Nike. It was created for former professional basketball player Michael Jordan. The original Air Jordan I sneakers were produced exclusively for Jordan in early 1984, and released to the public in late 1984. The shoes were designed for Nike by Peter Moore, Tinker Hatfield, and Bruce Kilgore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its introduction into the sports shoe market, the Air Jordans evolved from the original basketball shoes to models for different uses, including I-XXXII. The Jordan brand sponsors 21 active NBA players, including Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony. They also endorse Nike Air Jordan products. Also they sponsor other leagues such as the MLB, NFL, NASCAR and the WNBA.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan 1 was first produced for Michael Jordan in 1984. It was designed by Peter C. Moore.[2] The red and black colorway of the Nike Air Ship, the prototype for the Jordan 1, was later outlawed by NBA Commissioner David Stern for having very little white on them (this rule, known as the '51 percent' rule, was repealed in the late 2000s decade[3]).[4] It is a common misconception that the Jordan 1 was banned however, it was indeed the Nike Air Ship. After the Nike Air Ship was banned, Michael Jordan and Nike introduced the Jordan 1 in color ways with more white such as the \\"Chicago\\" color way and the \\"Black Toe\\" color way. They used the Nike Air Ship's banning as a promotional tool in advertisements hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage for the Jordan 1 and that whoever wore them had a certain edginess associated with outlaw activities. Fragment x Jordan 1's: Staying true to the original Air Jordan, the remastered design features an all-over, premium leather execution with black overlays, blue accents, and Fragment insignia. The Air Jordan I was originally released on the market from 1985 to 1986, with re-releases (known as \\"retros\\") in 1994, 2001ÿ2004, and 2007ÿ2017.\\r\\nThe success of the Air Jordan 1 encouraged Nike to release the New Air Jordan in 1986 for the new basketball season. Designed by Peter Moore and Bruce Kilgore, the original Air Jordan II was unique in that it was made in Italy. The Air Jordan 2 also retailed with a full length encapsulated Nike air bubble for maximum comfort. The Air Jordan 2 was the first Jordan not to have the Nike swoosh on the upper. The Air Jordan II was originally retailed at $100. The Air Jordan was originally released from 1986 to 1987. The model was revived from obscurity when Air Jordan collaborated with Just Don to create the Just Don x Air Jordan 2. The shoe featured premium blue quilted leather inspired by a Chanel handbag and released in very limited numbers on January 31, 2015 for $275. The shoe was released again in a Beach colourway bundled with a premium snapback and gold pin for $650 on January 30, 2016, later re-released in 1994, 2004ÿ2005, 2008, 2010, 2014ÿ2017.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan III was designed by Tinker Hatfield who works for Nike as a designer for stores and offices. By that time Michael Jordan was ready to leave Nike, but the Jordan III changed his mind. It was the first Air Jordan to feature a visible air unit on the heel, the new Jumpman logo, an elephant print trim and tumble leather to give it a luxury look. The Air Jordan III was also famous for the humorous ads depicting film director Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon, the character he played in his film She's Gotta Have It. This campaign was known as the \\"Mars and Mike\\" ad campaign, which was one of Nike's most successful advertisement campaigns. These were the first Jordan's to feature the \\"NIKE AIR\\" logo on the back, but later replaced by the Jumpman logo, with the words \\"AIR\\" underneath it, similar to the Air Jordan VI. These were said to be Michael Jordan's favorite shoes, he wore them during the 1988 NBA Slam Dunk Contest and many other events in his basketball career. The Air Jordan III's had poor sales when first reintroduced in 1994. On their second reintroduction in 2001, they sold well. The \\"Fire Red\\" Air Jordan III was released in March 2007, and late again in 2013.\\r\\nIn 2007, the Jordan Brand collaborated with director Spike Lee to release a limited pair of Air Jordan III's with a colorway based on the blue-yellow poster for Lee's film Do the Right Thing. The same year also saw the reintroduced versions of the Air Jordan III's in two monotone colorways, all black and all white, nicknamed the \\"Black Cats\\" and the \\"Pure Moneys\\" respectively. 2007 also had the \\"Flips\\" which moved the elephant print from the trim to the entire shoe and replacing it with white leather, indeed \\"Flipping\\" the original design of white leather with elephant print trim.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Jordan Brand reintroduced the highly sought after Air Jordan III in the True Blue colorway. It was an international-only release, meaning they were not sold in the US. In 2011, the brand released a Black History Month?(BHM) Air Jordan III colorway in commemoration of the 35th anniversary of Black History Month. The sneaker is black with gold trim and stitching as well as laser print around the toe and heel. The BHM III was a very limited release and there was said to have been no more than 3,000 pairs made. Also, the same year saw the release of the \\"True Blue\\" III on June 4. The Stealth colorway of the III was released in September and the Black Cements were released in November.[5] The \\"Black Flips\\" were released on December 3, 2011. In 2013, Jordan released a special edition of the Jordan III this shoe was deemed the Air Jordan III \\"Retro '88\\" White Cement and were released in February.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan III was originally released in 1988. The multiple retros and new colorways have been released in 1994, 2001, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\\r\\nIn 1989, Nike released the Air Jordan IV to the public. Designed by Tinker Hatfield, it was the first Air Jordan released on the global market. It had four colorways: White/ Black-Cement Grey, Black/Cement Grey, White/Fire Red-Black, and Off White/Military Blue.\\r\\nNike featured director and actor Spike Lee in ads for AJ IV. Lee had featured the shoe in his movie Do The Right Thing. The Air Jordan Bordeaux \\"Spiz'ike IV\\" was made to commemorate Lee's friendship with Michael Jordan.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan IV was on Jordan's feet when he made \\"The Shot,\\" a series winner in Game 5 of the 1989 NBA First Round between the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers. In 2012 a Cavalier colorway dubbed the \\"Cavs\\" was released to honor \\"The Shot.\\"\\r\\nThe Air Jordan IV was re-released in 1999 and retroed in 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010ÿ2013 and 2015ÿ2017. Recent retroed colorways are the Retro 4 \\"Legend Blue\\", \\"Oreo\\" in early 2015, and the Retro 4 OG \\"Cement\\" that released on February 13, 2016.[6]\\r\\nThe Air Jordan V was released in February 1990, designed by Tinker Hatfield again. Some elements were carried over from the Air Jordan IV, but overall they were a completely new look. Some of its new features were a reflective tongue (with a unique protruding design and look), translucent rubber soles and lace locks.[7] The soles gave them a new look, but it yellowed over time when exposed to moisture and were the source of many complaints early on due to the slippery nature of the soles when collecting dust.\\r\\nHatfield is believed to have drawn inspiration for the Air Jordan V from World War II fighter planes, which was most notably visible in the shark teeth shapes on the midsole. The Air Jordan V was reintroduced in 2000, including a new colorway featuring Michael Jordan's high school (Laney High) colors. In 2006 several V's were reintroduced, including the LS \\"Grape\\" V's, the LS \\"burgundy\\" V's, the \\"Fire-Red\\" V's, the \\"Green Bean\\" V's, and \\"Stealth Blue V's. Along with the latter, a very limited laser design and the black/metallic/fire red colorways were released in early 2007.\\r\\nIn the month of May 2009, Air Jordan confirmed the release of an \\"DMP II\\" consisting of two Air Jordan V's.[8] The second colorway features a 3M material base with black laces and midsole. The retail price was $310.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan V was originally released in 1990. It was retroed in 2000, 2006ÿ2009, 2011 and 2013ÿ2017.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan V saw a lot of use in popular sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. During many episodes Will Smith wore the 'metallic silver', 'grape', and 'fire red' colorway. To pay tribute to his character, Jordan released the Air Jordan 5 Bel Air in 2013.[9]\\r\\nThe Air Jordan VI had a new design by Tinker Hatfield and released in 1991. The Original 5 colorways were: Black/Infrared, White/Infrared, White/ Carmine-Black, White/Sport Blue, and Off White/Maroon. The Air Jordan VI introduced a reinforcement around the toe, It had two holes in the tongue, and a molded heel tab on the back of the sneaker (demanded by Jordan so it wouldn't hit his Achilles tendon). Like the Air Jordan V this sneaker also had Clear rubber/\\"Icy\\" Soles. The Air Jordan VI was the last Air Jordan to feature the Nike Air logo on it.\\r\\nLater that year the Bulls defeated the Lakers in the 1991 NBA Finals, with Jordan (wearing the Black/Infrared) named as the most valuable player. That was also the first NBA Championship won by Jordan and the Bulls. The Jordan VI was also seen in the film White Men Can't Jump, which was produced in 1991 and released one year later.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan VI has been retro-ed many times since its original release in 1991, Notable releases were in 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014 with the Black Infrared Colorway.\\r\\nIn addition to a Porsche-inspired rear pull tab and visible air the Air Jordan VI was the first Jordan with an inner bootie.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan VI was originally released in 1991. It was retro-ed in 2000, 2002, 2006, 2008ÿ2010, 2012 and 2014ÿ2017.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan VI saw much of screen time in 2015's Creed. Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) can be seen sporting the black/infrared and the white/varsity red-black colorway through most of the movie,[10] most notably during the training montage before the big fight that Rocky films are known for.[11]\\r\\nThe VI was the first shoe used by the protagonist of Slam Dunk, Hanamichi Sakuragi.[12] Nike released special versions of both the VI and the Jordan Super.Fly 3 featuring artwork from the series in 2014. The VI also had Sakuragi's number 10 embroidered on the side of the heels.[13] Various other models in the Air Jordan line are featured in the series, including the original (which Sakuragi eventually switched to), the V, and the XII (both worn by Sakuragi's rival, Kaede Rukawa).[14]\\r\\nThe Air Jordan VII was released in 1992 with a new design by Tinker Hatfield. This shoe introduced the huarache technology which allowed the shoes to better conform to the user's foot. A few things were no longer featured on the new model, such as the visible air sole, the Nike Air logo, and the translucent soles. This was the first Air-Jordan in the line that did not have any distinctive \\"Nike Air\\" on the outer portions of the shoe. The \\"Nike Air\\" branding was still on the in-soles, which Air Jordans VIII-XI also had. The VIIs were also known for a successful ad campaign in which Bugs Bunny appeared alongside Michael Jordan to market the shoes.\\r\\nWhen Jordan went to compete at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics to play for the US Men's Basketball Team (also known as the \\"Dream Team\\"), Nike released a special Olympic color combo of the Air Jordan VII model which had Jordan's Olympic jersey number 9, instead of the usual \\"23\\" found on other colorways.\\r\\nVarious models of the Air Jordan VII were re-released in 2002, again in 2004, and again with different colors in 2006.\\r\\nIn 2011 the Air Jordan VII saw releases in the \\"Orion\\" and \\"Bordeaux\\" colorways. Other colorways are confirmed for a 2011 release as well, such as the \\"Cardinals\\" which is a re-release and \\"Year of the Rabbits\\". The \\"Olympic\\" and \\"Charcoal\\" (commonly referred to as Raptors) were re-released in 2012.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan VII was originally released in 1992. It was retro-ed in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008ÿ2012 and 2015ÿ2017.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan VIII was released to coincide with the 1992ÿ1993 NBA season. The eighth model of the Air Jordan was noticeably heavier than its predecessors. This shoe had a lot more detail than most of the earlier Air Jordan's such as two crossover straps on each shoe and a Jumpman. Thus the Air Jordan VIII model became known as the \\"Punisher\\" because of the advanced basketball ankle support and enhanced traction. This shoe contains a full length air sole, polyurethane midsole, polycarbonate shank plate, and two crossover straps (for added support and more custom fit).\\r\\nThe Air Jordan VIII was originally released in 1993. It was retro-ed in 2003, 2007, 2008, 2013 and 2015ÿ2017.\\r\\nOriginally released in November 1993, the Air Jordan IX model was the first model released after Michael Jordan's retirement. Jordan never played an NBA season wearing these shoes. This model was inspired by baseball cleats that Jordan wore when playing minor-league baseball.\\r\\nLike the VII and VIII models, the Air Jordan IX featured an inner sock sleeve and nubuck accents. The sole featured different symbols and languages of different countries. The Air Jordan IX has been the shoe chosen to adorn Jordan's feet for his statue outside of the United Center in Chicago.\\r\\nIn popular culture, in the children's movie The Little Rascals one of the bullies, Butch is wearing a pair of these shoes. American rap icon Tupac Shakur also wore Air Jordans in a popular \\"Thug Life\\" photo set in 1993.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan IX was originally released from 1993 to 1994. It was retro-ed in 2002, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014ÿ2018.\\r\\nThis was released in 1995 in eight different colors, Black/grey, varsity-black, off-white/black/varsity red*, Powder Blue (worn by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Men's and Women's basketball teams), Orlando Magic*, New York Knicks*, Seattle SuperSonics*, and Sacramento Kings*. It was the first Air Jordan to feature a lightweight Phylon midsole. The shoe also featured all of Michael Jordan's accomplishments so far on the outsole.\\r\\nIn 2012, the Air Jordan X was re-released. They are dubbed the \\"Chicago Bulls\\", as they are part of a regional pack (City Pack), representing five teams. The lacing and tongue are completely black, and the red inner lining contrasts with the red inserts on the outsole. The outsole's design features a striped (wavy) design, which list many of Jordan's accomplishments. They retailed at $160. The Air Jordan X was released again in an OVO collaboration in 2015 and 2016, releasing in white and black colorways respectively with stingray detailing.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan X was originally released from 1994 to 1995. It was retro-ed in 2005, 2008 and 2012ÿ2016.\\r\\nThis model was designed by Tinker Hatfield. When the shoe launched, Michael Jordan (retired from basketball by then) was with the Birmingham Barons in baseball's minor baseball leagues. Hatfield designed the sneaker waiting for Jordan to come back and hoping he would play in them.\\r\\nThe ballistic mesh upper of the sneaker was meant to make the Air Jordan XI lighter and more durable than past sneakers. Further changes came with the use of a carbon fiber spring plate in the translucent \\"frosty\\" outsole, giving the shoe better torque when twisting on the court. The highlight and arguably best-known aspect of the shoe is its patent leather mudguard. Patent leather was lightweight compared to genuine leather and also tended not to stretch as much ÿ a property to help keep the foot within the bounds of the foot bed during directional changes on the court. The patent leather gave the XI a \\"formal\\" look. When this shoe released, some wore this model with business suits instead of dress shoes.\\r\\nThe sneakers were only samples in 1995 when Jordan decided to come back to the NBA. Hatfield and Nike discouraged Jordan from playing in them, but once they were produced, he couldn't resist. Also noteworthy, Jordan violated league dress code by wearing the shoes, as his teammates wore all-black shoes. It wasn't the first time Jordan had run afoul of NBA footwear rules, having broken them with his very first signature shoe in 1985. He was fined $5,000 for not following the Bulls colorway policy with the AJ XI. After the fine, Nike made him a pair of the shoes in a black/white/concord colorway for the series against Orlando. A similar black/white/royal blue colorway was released to the public at the end of 2000. The colorway was changed for the public release because the concord purple had looked like royal blue on television.\\r\\nJordan wore the Air Jordan XI on the way to helping the Chicago Bulls claim the 1995ÿ96 NBA Championship. He also wore the XI white Columbia colorway in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game and was selected MVP of the game. The shoes received more media exposure when Jordan wore the Air Jordan XI model in the 1996 animated movie Space Jam. These shoes were eventually released in 2000 and re-released in 2009 with the nickname Space Jams. The concord purple was changed to royal blue for the released versions of the shoe.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XI was originally released from 1995 to 1996. It was retro'd in 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2006ÿ2017. The Air Jordan XI is the most popular Air Jordan in the series and has released almost ritualistically every December since 2008, selling out in minutes. It also is Hatfield's favorite. With the Air Jordan XI being the most popular Jordan, supply used to be very limited and would cause fans to line up outside of stores before releases.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XII was inspired by Nisshoki (the Japanese flag), and a 19th-century women dress boot. However, featuring gold-plated steel lace loops, embossed lizard skin pattern and a full length zoom air unit with a carbon fiber shank plate, this model set a new direction in style and technology in shoe design. Though not as light weight as previous models, the construction and firmness of the shoe is widely considered to be the most durable and sturdy shoes from the Air Jordan line. The first model released after the creation of subsidiary Jordan Brand, the Air Jordan XII has no Nike branding on it of any kind, while all the models before it have Nike Air or other Nike branding outwardly (Air Jordans I-VI) or just simply on the insoles (Air Jordans VII-XI). This shoe came in 5 colorways and was released on March 13. The shoe was re-released on December 25, 2008 with the Eleven as the final countdown pack. In addition, the Twelve was combined with the Thirteen numbered Jordan to produce the 12.5. As of today, the 11/12 countdown package (retro) retails for US$750ÿUS$800, well above the starting price of US$310. The Air Jordan XII has been subject to many highly limited colorways recently such as the Air Jordan 12 x PSNY collaboration, the Wings colorway that was limited to 12,000 pairs, and the OVO collaboration.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XII was originally released from 1996 to 1997. It was retro-ed in 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2011ÿ2013, and 2015ÿ2017.[15]\\r\\nIn 1997, Air Jordan XIII's were released to the public. This model was known for its cushioning along the feet, designed by Hatfield. The Black Panther was the inspiration for the Air Jordan XIII, the sole resembles the pads on a panther's paw. But also the panther is the hologram on the back of the shoe which imitates a panther's eyes in the dark when light is shined at them. They were re-released in 2005, which coincided with the release of the Air Jordan 8s shoe.\\r\\nIn the movie He Got Game, the Air Jordan XIII was worn by Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington). Ray Allen, who played Jake's son Jesus in the film, wore them when he broke Reggie Miller's all-time record for made three-point shots during a game against the Lakers in Boston during the 2011 season. The Jordan Brand re-released the Air Jordan XIII at the end of 2010, which included the French Blue/Flint Grey, White/Red-Black, \\"Playoff\\" color way and the Black/Altitude Green color way. In 2017, Jordan Brand released the \\"History of Flight\\" colorway. This colorway is from the 2009 World Basketball Festival, where the \\"History of Flight\\" collection was revealed to celebrate Jordan's 25th anniversary.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XIII was originally released from 1997 to 1998. It was retro-ed in 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010ÿ2017.\\r\\nInspired by the Ferrari 550 M which Michael Jordan owned, the Air Jordan XIV was originally released from 1997 to 1999. It was re-released in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2014ÿ2017.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XIV co-styled by Hatfield and Mark Smith was made race ready and equipped with the Jordan Jumpman insignia on a Ferrari shaped badge. In addition, these shoes include breathable air ducts on the outer sole. The color scheme of predominant black accentuated with red was nicknamed \\"The Last Shot\\" because Michael Jordan wore them as he hit the game winning shot over Bryon Russell, of the Utah Jazz, in his final game with the Chicago Bulls in the 1998 NBA Finals.\\r\\nThere are 14 Jumpman logos on Air Jordan XIV's7 on each shoecorresponding the shoes' number in the series. They can be found in the following places:\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XVs were released in 1999ÿ2000. Reggie Miller wore it during the 2000 NBA Finals.\\r\\nThis was the first shoe after Jordan's retirement. The design of the XV's originated from the aircraft prototype X-15, which was developed by NASA during the 1950s. The sides of the XV were made from woven kevlar fibre. The Jordan XV's were the first Air Jordan's to be negatively received in a while (the last being the Air Jordan 2's), because the quality on the Jordan shoes was bad.[16]\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XV was originally released from 1999 to 2000. It was retro-ed in 2007, 2008 and 2016-2017.\\r\\nAir Jordan XVIs, designed by Nike's Senior Footwear Designer Wilson Smith, were released in 2001. This meaning it was the first design since the II's that Hatfield was not behind. Smith decided to bring in a few design elements/fabrics from earlier releases. The shoe featured the return of the clear rubber sole (V, VI, XI) and patent leather (XI).\\r\\nUnique to the Air Jordan XVI was a gaiter/shroud that covered the shoe and could be removed to give the shoe a new look. Not only was this for fashion purposes, it also had a thermal functionality.\\r\\nThe shoe was said to be stiff and that the shroud/gaiter could easily fall off when playing basketball. The black/red and white/midnight navy versions of the shoe both featured patent leather which very easily creased and cracked.[17]\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XVI was originally released in 2001. It was retro-ed in 2008, 2014 and 2016.\\r\\nThis pair of Jordan's come equipped with Keefer, which held the shoes and a compact disc containing the Air Jordan XVII song. The retail price of the shoe was US$200. The defining functional design element of the Air Jordan XVII model, which was later replicated on the Air Jordan XXIII model, was the reinforced mid-sole which provided a sturdy and stable chassis for the shoe. They were made in four mid top colors and three low-top colors.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XVII was originally released in 2002. It was retro-ed in 2008 and 2016.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XVIII shoe was released in 2003, and was the shoe for Jordan's last season, in which he played for the Washington Wizards.\\r\\nThe shoe was designed by Air Jordan Senior Footwear Designer, Tate Kuerbis, a person that had been part of the Jordan footwear design team since 1999 and with Nike since 1995. The inspiration for the design came from a number of things; sleek racing lines of the auto world, carbon fibre-based monocoque of F1 race cars, race car driving shoes (rubber heel wrap) and Fine Italian dress shoes (bold stitching on the soles).\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XVIII was originally released from 2003 to 2004. It was retro-ed in 2008.\\r\\nReleased in 2004, this is the first Jordan release after his third, and final, retirement which came after the 2002ÿ03 NBA season. The design was inspired by the Black Mamba snake, and two original colorways where released: white/flint grey and black/red. Three regional colorways and three special edition colorways were released. They consisted of the East, West, and Midwest edition for regular and West, East, and Olympic for the SE (special edition).\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XIX used innovative materials. The upper section of shoe was developed in collaboration with the global materials consultancy Material ConneXion, who sourced Nike a sleeving normally used in architectural applications for protecting PVC pipes from bursting. In theory, this allowed for a shoe without laces, because the sleeving does not stretch. Nonetheless, the Air Jordan XIX model did include a set of laces behind the sleeve to better secure the shoe. They are the lightest Air Jordans ever made.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XIX was originally released in 2004. It was retro-ed in 2008.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XX was also inspired by bicycling shoes. The strap was placed in the center of the shoe over the laces. It also helped to create a tighter fit and increased support.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XX was originally released in 2005. It was retro-ed in 2008 and 2015.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XXI model of shoes was designed by D'Wayne Edwards and inspired by sport touring vehicles. The shoe features lower-foot air grilles, double-overlasted Phylon midsole, a carbon fibre shank plate and a seamless diamond-quilted booty. It also has a tenable I.P.S. suspension system that lets the wearer choose between Zoom and Encapsulated air.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XXI was introduced on television by the \\"Second Generation\\" advertisement.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XXI was originally released in 2006. It was retro-ed in 2008.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan XX2/XXII shoe model, designed by D'Wayne Edwards, was released on March 24, 2007. The original retail price of the model was US$175.

The Jordan 6ixty Plus (60+) is a hybrid sneaker from Jordan Brand that combines the various sneakers Michael Jordan wore when he scored 60 or more points in an NBA Game.

It borrows prominent design elements from the Air Jordan III, IV, V, VI, and XX. It also retains a strap across the shoe laces, that is a custom modification with a design that seems to be elephant print but is instead a series of relevant icons, etc. The Jordan Son Of Mars was birthed from the Spizike, which was originally inspired by all the Jordan shoes made in collaboration with famous urban director Spike Lee. Son of Mars is a sneaker directly influenced by Spike Lee's longtime involvement with the brand, as the shoe pieces together models in which Spike (or Mars Blackmon rather) had a hand in launching.\\r\\nThe shoe breakdown begins with elements from the first Tinker Hatfield years, Mars Blackmon; Lee's loudmouthed character first appeared alongside Michael Jordan for the release of the Air Jordan III, a sneaker whose immediately recognizable elephant print bookends the Jordan Son of Mars, with sectioning on the back end and towards the toe. Next the Air Jordan IV, which is pretty conspicuous in this hybrid release, shows up only in the form of the netting running below the laces. The sole gottem ion is all Air Jordan V, as the coveted icy treatment splashes across the bottom and the angular 'teeth' of the midsole rear up towards the toe. The V actually extends its reach to the top end too, with the textured Jumpman tongue bursting out from the familiar see-through lacelocks. Building up the ankle area is the higher-hitting support of the Air Jordan VI, complete with the attached loop on back and the perforated paneling reaching up the side of the shoe. The midsection which completes the sneaker is a major fast-forward, leaping ahead to the Air Jordan XX in the form of the lasered strap.\\r\\nThe Jordan Son of Mars takes on one of the favorite color schemes in the Jordan Brand line.\\r\\nThis package consisted of two variations of Retro Air Jordan, in which each model number equaled 23.

Many other colorways exist and Jordan Brand continues to release additional colors that pay tribute to different Jordan and Nike shoes along with new colorways specific to 6 Rings shoes.\\r\\nThere even exists a \\"winterized 6 rings\\" which are a modified 6 Rings shoe turned into a durable boot designed for the outdoors which changes some of the design and placement of the inspired pieces and parts from the Air Jordans the shoe pays tribute.\\r\\nOf particular note, there is an Olympic colorway, a Nelly version apparently inspired by the rap artist Nelly and a shoe that combines the colors of all the teams that the Bulls defeated in the NBA Finals, acting as the 'sixth shoe' since only five separate teams were defeated for the Bulls to win six championships; the Utah Jazz was defeated twice, in 1997 and 1998.\\r\\nThe Air Jordan line has been associated with many riots, assaults, robberies, and murders,[27][28][28][29][30][31][32] such as the murder of a 15-year-old high school student named Michael Eugene Thomas who was choked to death by one of his peers for a pair of Air Jordan sneakers in 1989.[33]\\r\\nIn 1988, the then-principal of Mumford High School in Detroit mentioned that clothing-related violence had reached a point where he felt it was necessary to ban certain items of clothing, including the Air Jordan sneaker, from the school grounds.[34] This ban was the first of many dress codes implemented in schools after the wave of robberies, beatings, and shootings over possession of Air Jordan sneakers and other items of clothing.[35]\\r\\nNike owns none of the factories where Air Jordans are produced and contracts the work to various factory owners.

The same month in Vietnam 1,300 workers went on strike demanding a 1-cent-per-hour raise, and a year later in 1998, 3,000 workers in China went on strike to protest hazardous working conditions and low wages cause.[36]","input":"When were the first pair of jordans released?"},{"output":"three","context":"","input":"How many members were there in the bee gees?"},{"output":"4,761","context":"","input":"How many stores does walmart have in usa?"},{"output":"twelve novels and two collections of short stories","context":"The James Bond literary franchise is a series of novels and short stories, first published in 1953 by Ian Fleming, a British author, journalist, and former naval intelligence officer. James Bond, often referred to by his code name, 007, is a British Secret Service agent; the character was created by journalist and author Ian Fleming, and first appeared in his 1953 novel Casino Royale; the books are set in a contemporary period, between May 1951 and February 1964. Fleming went on to write a total of twelve novels and two collections of short stories, all written at his Jamaican home Goldeneye and published annually. Two of his books were published after his death in 1964.\\r\\nSince Fleming's death a number of other authors have written continuation works. Some of these have been novelizations of episodes in the series of Bond films, produced by Eon Productions, while others were either continuation novels or short stories. The first author was Kingsley Amis, writing under the pseudonym of \\"Robert Markham\\" who produced one novel; then came novelist and biographer John Pearson who wrote a fictional biography of Bond. Novelist and screenwriter Christopher Wood wrote two novelizations in the late 1970s. Writer John Gardner was asked to continue the series by copyright holders Ian Fleming Publications and, between 1981 and 1996, he wrote fourteen novels and two novelizations. After Gardner retired due to ill health, American author Raymond Benson continued the stories and wrote six Bond novels, three novelizations and three short stories between 1996 and 2002.\\r\\nThere was a hiatus of six years before Sebastian Faulks was commissioned to write a further Bond novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Ian Fleming's birth. This was followed in 2011 by a novel by American author Jeffery Deaver, a 2013 book by William Boyd and a further instalment in September 2015 by Anthony Horowitz, with a second Horowitz novel announced for publication in May 2018. There have also been two Fleming estate-sanctioned spin-off series of books: Young Bond, based around Bond's adventures whilst a schoolboy at Eton College, and The Moneypenny Diaries, a series of books and short stories focusing on the supporting character Miss Moneypenny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II Fleming had mentioned to friends that he wanted to write a spy novel,[1] but it was not until 17 February 1952 that he began to write his first novel, Casino Royale. He started writing his book at his Jamaican home Goldeneye, typing out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination;[2] he finished work on the manuscript in just over two months,[3] completing it on 18 March 1952.[4] Publishers Jonathan Cape were initially reluctant to publish the book, but were persuaded by Fleming's brother Peter (1907ÿ1971), who had previously published material through them.[5] On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at 10s, 6d,[6] with a cover that had been devised by Fleming himself.[7] The first edition of 4,728 copies of Casino Royale sold out in less than a month;[7] a second print run the same month also sold out,[6] as did a third run of more than 8,000 books published in May 1954.[8] At the time, Fleming was the Foreign Manager for Kemsley Newspapers, an organisation which owned The Sunday Times. Upon accepting the job, Fleming requested that he be allowed three months holiday per year, which allowed him the freedom to write.[1]\\r\\nThe novel centred on the exploits of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the 00 section of the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies.[9] Fleming based his creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond \\"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\\".[10] After the publication of Casino Royale, Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story;[1] in total, between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two booksThe Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylightspublished posthumously.[11]\\r\\n\\"Octopussy\\" Bond tracks down a World War II hero who had murdered his friend to steal a cache of Nazi gold.\\r\\n\\"The Living Daylights\\" Bond is assigned sniper duty, but when he sees the sniper is a beautiful woman, he shoots the butt of her rifle instead of killing her.\\r\\n\\"The Property of a Lady\\" Bond visits Sotheby's to identify a KGB agent.\\r\\n\\"007 in New York\\" Bond warns a female MI6 employee that her new boyfriend is a KGB agent.\\r\\nIn the summer of 1958, the CBS television network commissioned Fleming to write episodes of a television show based on the James Bond character. This deal came about after the success of the 1954 television adaptation of Casino Royale as an episode of the CBS television series Climax![26] Fleming agreed to the deal, and began to write outlines for the series; however, CBS later dropped the idea.[27] In January and February 1959 Fleming adapted four of the television plots into short stories and added a fifth story he had written in the summer of 1958.[28] The stories were originally titled The Rough with the Smooth, although this was changed to For Your Eyes Only for publication, which included the subtitle Five Secret Occasions in the Life of James Bond.[26]\\r\\nAfter Fleming's death, a second collection featuring two short stories was released, Octopussy and The Living Daylights.[29] When the paperback edition of the book was published, \\"The Property of a Lady\\" was also included[30] and, by 2002, \\"007 in New York\\" had been added to the book by Penguin Books.[31]\\r\\nIndependent scholar John Griswold constructed a \\"high-level chronology of James Bond's life\\", based on the logic of depicted events and actual time periods referred to in the books.[43][nb 4] This chronology differs from the publication sequence.[44] Griswold also deliberately discounts the chronological significance of actual historic events mentioned in the novels and stories, arguing that Fleming made such references for effect without synchronising them accurately to his fiction.[45] Fellow Bond-scholar Henry Chancellor also worked through the Bond chronology, which broadly agrees with Griswold, although there are differences. Chancellor noted that \\"Fleming was always vague about dates\\", although the novels are supposed to be set in order of publication.[46]\\r\\nFollowing Fleming's death in 1964, Glidrose Productions, publishers of the James Bond novels and since renamed Ian Fleming Publications, approached author James Leasor to write a continuation novel, but he declined.[50] Glidrose then commissioned Kingsley Amis, who, under the pseudonym of \\"Robert Markham\\", wrote Colonel Sun, which was published on 28 March 1968.[30]\\r\\nIn 1973, Glidrose permitted publication of John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond entitled James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007. This book, written in the first person, posits that Bond was a real person about whom Ian Fleming wrote a series of adventures. This is the only Bond work where the author shares copyright with Glidrose.\\r\\nIn 1977, the Eon Productions film The Spy Who Loved Me was released and, due to the radical differences between the film and the original novel of the same name, Eon productions authorised a novelization, James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me. The 1979 film Moonraker, which other than the villain's name also substantially diverged from the original source novel, was also produced in novel form, as James Bond and Moonraker; both books were written by screenwriter Christopher Wood.[51]\\r\\nIn the 1980s, the Bond series was initially revived with new novels by John Gardner, although initially he almost turned the series down.[55] Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote ÿ Licence to Kill and GoldenEye ÿ were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner stated that he wanted \\"to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s\\",[56] although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them.[57] Even though Gardner kept the ages the same, he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years.[58] In 1996, Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.[59] With the influence of the American publishers, Putnam's, the Gardner novels showed an increase in the number of Americanisms used in the book, such as a waiter wearing \\"pants\\", rather than trousers, in The Man from Barbarossa.[60] James Harker, writing in The Guardian, considered that the Gardner books were \\"dogged by silliness\\",[60] giving examples of Scorpius, where much of the action is set in Chippenham, and Win, Lose or Die, where \\"Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher\\".[60]\\r\\nIn 1996, American author Raymond Benson became the writer of the Bond novels. Benson had previously written The James Bond Bedside Companion, first published in 1984,[76] and had also written scenarios and support material for the early 1980s 007 James Bond dice-and-paper role playing game. By the time he moved on to other, non-Bond related projects in 2002, Benson had written six Bond novels, three novelizations and three short stories.[77] Benson followed Gardner's pattern of setting Bond in the contemporary timeframe of the 1990s[78] and, according to academic Jeremy Black, had more echoes of Fleming's style than John Gardner.[79] Benson also changed Bond's gun back to the Walther PPK,[80] put him behind the wheel of a Jaguar XK8[81] and made him swear more,[82] which led Black to note that there was an increased level of crudity lacking in either Fleming or Gardner.[79] However, commenting in The Australian, Peter Janson-Smith, Fleming's former literary agent, noted that Benson \\"has got the Fleming feel?... It's as close to Fleming as I have seen.\\"[83] The Peterborough Evening Telegraph agreed, stating that with Benson's 007, in keeping more with Fleming, \\"PC-ness goes out the window and it's a more ruthless Bond with bad habits.\\"[84] The Sunday Mercury in 1999 said, \\"Benson has made Bond less gimmicky, concentrating on the action rather than the gadgets. The result is a slick enough read for dedicated Bond fans who like blazing guns (Walthers, of course) and beautiful women\\"[85] and Kirkus Reviews called Benson's 007 \\"a chip off the old block and, if not a gilt-edged Bond, at least a double-A.\\"[86]\\r\\nGlidrose twice approached Lee Child, author of the Jack Reacher novels, about writing a Bond novel but he turned them down.[95] Ian Fleming Publications then commissioned Sebastian Faulks to write a continuation novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Ian Fleming's birth.[96] The booktitled Devil May Carewas published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US.[97] Faulks ignored the timeframe established by Gardner and Benson and instead reverted to that used by Fleming and Amis, basing his novel in the 1960s;[78] he also managed to use a number of the cultural touchstones of the sixties in the book.[98] Faulks was true to Bond's original character and background too, and provided \\"a Flemingesque hero\\"[78] who drove a battleship grey 1967 T-series Bentley.[81]\\r\\nThe American writer Jeffery Deaver was then commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to produce Carte Blanche, which was published on 26 May 2011.[99] The book updated Bond working for a post-9/11 agency, independent of MI5 or MI6.[100] On 26 September 2013 the novel Solo, by William Boyd was published in the UK and by HarperCollins in Canada and the US; the book was once again set in the 1960s.[101][102] In October 2014 it was announced that Anthony Horowitz was to write a further Bond instalment. The novel, titled Trigger Mortis, is set in the 1950s, and it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming.[103] In February 2018, it was announced that a second Horowitz novel, again building upon unpublished Fleming and this time a prequel to Casino Royale, titled Forever and a Day would be published by Jonathan Cape on 31 May 2018.[104]\\r\\nThe Young Bond series of novels was started by Charlie Higson[109] and, between 2005 and 2009, five novels and one short story were published.[110] The first Young Bond novel, SilverFin was also adapted and released as a graphic novel on 2 October 2008 by Puffin Books.[111] Comic book artist Kev Walker illustrated Higson's novel.[112] Young Bond is set in the 1930s, which would fit the chronology with that of Fleming.[113]\\r\\nHigson stated that he was instructed by the Fleming estate to ignore all other interpretations of Bond, except the original Fleming version.[115] As the background to Bond's childhood, Higson used Bond's obituary in You Only Live Twice as well as his own and Fleming's childhoods.[116] In forming the early Bond character, Higson created the origins of some of Bond's character traits, including his love of cars and fine wine.[115]\\r\\nIn October 2013 Ian Fleming Publications announced that Stephen Cole would continue the series, with the first edition scheduled to be released in Autumn 2014.[117] The title was later confirmed as Shoot to Kill with a release date of 6 November 2014, and it was further confirmed that Cole would be credited as Steve Cole for the release.[118]","input":"How many james bond books did ian fleming?"},{"output":"neither risk averse nor risk seeking","context":"In economics and finance, risk neutral preferences are preferences that are neither risk averse nor risk seeking. A risk neutral party's decisions are not affected by the degree of uncertainty in a set of outcomes, so a risk neutral party is indifferent between choices with equal expected payoffs even if one choice is riskier. For example, if offered either $50 or a 50% chance each of $100 and $0, a risk neutral person would have no preference. In contrast, a risk averse person would prefer the first offer, while a risk seeking person would prefer the second.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the context of the theory of the firm, a risk neutral firm facing risk about the market price of its product, and caring only about profit, would maximize the expected value of its profit (with respect to its choices of labor input usage, output produced, etc.). But a risk averse firm in the same environment would typically take a more cautious approach.[1]\\r\\nIn portfolio choice,[2][3][4] a risk neutral investor who is able to choose any combination of an array of risky assets (various companies' stocks, various companies' bonds, etc.) would invest exclusively in the asset with the highest expected yield, ignoring its risk features relative to those of other assets, and would even sell short the asset with the lowest expected yield as much as is permitted in order to invest the proceeds in the highest expected-yield asset. In contrast, a risk averse investor would diversify among a variety of assets, taking account of their risk features, even though doing so would lower the expected return on the overall portfolio. The risk neutral investor's portfolio would have a higher expected return, but also a greater variance of possible returns.\\r\\nChoice under uncertainty is often characterized as the maximization of expected utility. Utility is often assumed to be a function of profit or final portfolio wealth, with a positive first derivative. The utility function whose expected value is maximized is concave for a risk averse agent, convex for a risk lover, and linear for a risk neutral agent. Thus in the risk neutral case, expected utility of wealth is simply equal to a linear function of expected wealth, and maximizing it is equivalent to maximizing expected wealth itself.","input":"What does it mean to be risk neutral?"},{"output":"three","context":"","input":"How many courtrooms does the high court have?"},{"output":"Julius Maada Bio","context":"State House\\r\\nThe President of the Republic of Sierra Leone is the head of state and the head of government of Sierra Leone, as well as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces.\\r\\nAs the head of the executive branch of the Sierra Leone government, the president implements laws passed by parliament.

The German libretto was originally prepared by Joseph Sonnleithner from the French of Jean-Nicolas Bouilly, with the work premiering at Vienna's Theater an der Wien on 20 November 1805. The following year, Stephan von Breuning?(de) helped shorten the work from three acts to two. After further work on the libretto by Georg Friedrich Treitschke, a final version was performed at the K?rntnertortheater on 23?May 1814. By convention, both of the first two versions are referred to as Leonore.\\r\\nThe libretto, with some spoken dialogue, tells how Leonore, disguised as a prison guard named \\"Fidelio\\", rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison. Bouilly's scenario fits Beethoven's aesthetic and political outlook: a story of personal sacrifice, heroism, and eventual triumph. With its underlying struggle for liberty and justice mirroring contemporary political movements in Europe, such topics are typical of Beethoven's \\"middle period\\". Notable moments in the opera include the \\"Prisoners' Chorus\\" (O welche Lust\\"O what a joy\\"), an ode to freedom sung by a chorus of political prisoners, Florestan's vision of Leonore come as an angel to rescue him, and the scene in which the rescue finally takes place. The finale celebrates Leonore's bravery with alternating contributions of soloists and chorus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work has a long and complicated history of composition: it went through three versions during Beethoven's career, and some of the music was first written as part of an earlier, never-completed opera.\\r\\nThe distant origin of Fidelio dates from 1803, when the librettist and impresario Emanuel Schikaneder worked out a contract with Beethoven to write an opera. The contract included free housing for Beethoven in the apartment complex that was part of Schikaneder's large suburban theater, the Theater an der Wien. Beethoven was to set a new libretto by Schikaneder, entitled Vestas Feuer; however, this libretto was not to Beethoven's liking. He spent about a month composing music for it, then abandoned it when the libretto for Fidelio came to his attention.\\r\\nThe time Beethoven spent on Vestas Feuer was not entirely wasted, as two important numbers from Fidelio, Pizarro's \\"'Ha! Welch ein Augenblick!\\" and the duet \\"O namenlose Freude\\" for Leonora and Florestan, both originated as music for Vestas Feuer. Beethoven remained as a resident of the Theater an der Wien for some time after he had abandoned Vestas Feuer for Fidelio, and was eventually freed from his obligations to Schikaneder when the latter was fired from his post as theater director in 1804.\\r\\nFidelio itself, which Beethoven began in 1804 immediately after giving up on Vestas Feuer, was first performed in 1805 and was extensively revised by the composer for subsequent performances in 1806 and 1814. Although Beethoven used the title Leonore, oder Der Triumph der ehelichen Liebe (\\"Leonore, or The Triumph of Married Love\\"), the 1805 performances were billed as Fidelio at the theatre's insistence, to avoid confusion with the 1798 opera Lonore, ou Lamour conjugal by Pierre Gaveaux, and the 1804 opera Leonora by Ferdinando Paer (a score of which was owned by Beethoven). Beethoven published the 1806 libretto and, in 1810, a vocal score under the title Leonore, and the current convention is to use the name Leonore for both the 1805 (three-act) and 1806 (two-act) versions and Fidelio only for the final 1814 revision.\\r\\nThe first version with a three-act German libretto adapted by Joseph Sonnleithner from the French of Jean-Nicolas Bouilly premiered at the Theater an der Wien on 20 November 1805, with additional performances the following two nights. The success of these performances was hindered by the fact that Vienna was under French military occupation, and most of the audience were French military officers.\\r\\nAfter this premiere, Beethoven was pressured by friends to revise and shorten the opera into just two acts, and he did so with the help of Stephan von Breuning. The composer also wrote a new overture (now known as \\"Leonore No.?3\\"; see below). In this form the opera was first performed on 29 March and 10 April 1806, with greater success. Further performances were prevented by a dispute between Beethoven and the theatre management.\\r\\nIn 1814 Beethoven revised his opera yet again, with additional work on the libretto by Georg Friedrich Treitschke. This version was first performed at the K?rntnertortheater on 23 May 1814, again under the title Fidelio. The 17-year-old Franz Schubert was in the audience, having sold his school books to obtain a ticket. The increasingly deaf Beethoven led the performance, \\"assisted\\" by Michael Umlauf, who later performed the same task for Beethoven at the premiere of the Ninth Symphony. The role of Pizarro was taken by Johann Michael Vogl, who later became known for his collaborations with Schubert. This version of the opera was a great success, and Fidelio has been part of the operatic repertory ever since.\\r\\nBeethoven cannot be said to have enjoyed the difficulties posed by writing and producing an opera. In a letter to Treitschke he said, \\"I assure you, dear Treitschke, that this opera will win me a martyr's crown. You have by your co-operation saved what is best from the shipwreck. For all this I shall be eternally grateful to you.\\"[2]\\r\\nThe full score was not published until 1826, and all three versions are known as Beethoven's Opus 72.[3]\\r\\nThe first performance outside Vienna took place in Prague on 21 November 1814, with a revival in Vienna on 3 November 1822. In its two-act version, the opera was staged in London on 18 May 1832 at the King's Theatre, and in New York on 9 September 1839 at the Park Theatre.[4]\\r\\nFidelio was Arturo Toscanini's first complete opera performance to be broadcast in the USA, over the NBC radio network, in December 1944, by the NBC Symphony Orchestra, featuring soloists from the Metropolitan Opera (though a shortwave broadcast of one act, conducted by Toscanini, had earlier been relayed from a 16 August 1936 performance at Salzburg.) Divided into two consecutive broadcasts, the 1944 performances were later issued by RCA Victor on LPs and CDs.[5]\\r\\nFidelio was the first opera performed in Berlin after the end of the World War II, with the Deutsche Oper staging it under the baton of Robert Heger at the only undamaged theatre, the Theater des Westens, in September 1945.[6] At the time, Thomas Mann remarked: \\"What amount of apathy was needed [by musicians and audiences] to listen to Fidelio in Himmler's Germany without covering their faces and rushing out of the hall!\\"[7]\\r\\nNot long after the end of World War II and the fall of Nazism, conductor Wilhelm Furtw?ngler remarked in Salzburg in 1948:\\r\\n[T]he conjugal love of Leonore appears, to the modern individual armed with realism and psychology, irremediably abstract and theoretical.... Now that political events in Germany have restored to the concepts of human dignity and liberty their original significance, this is the opera which, thanks to the music of Beethoven, gives us comfort and courage.... Certainly, Fidelio is not an opera in the sense we are used to, nor is Beethoven a musician for the theater, or a dramaturgist. He is quite a bit more, a whole musician, and beyond that, a saint and a visionary. That which disturbs us is not a material effect, nor the fact of the 'imprisonment'; any film could create the same effect. No, it is the music, it is Beethoven himself. It is this 'nostalgia of liberty' he feels, or better, makes us feel; this is what moves us to tears. His Fidelio has more of the Mass than of the Opera to it; the sentiments it expresses come from the sphere of the sacred, and preach a 'religion of humanity' which we never found so beautiful or necessary as we do today, after all we have lived through. Herein lies the singular power of this unique opera.... Independent of any historical consideration ... the flaming message of Fidelio touches deeply.\\r\\nWe realize that for us Europeans, as for all men, this music will always represent an appeal to our conscience.[8]\\r\\nOn 5 November 1955, the Vienna State Opera was re-opened with Fidelio, conducted by Karl B?hm. This performance was the first live television broadcast by ORF at a time when there were about 800 television sets in Austria.\\r\\nThe first night of Fidelio at the Semperoper in Dresden on 7 October 1989 on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the DDR (East Germany) coincided with violent demonstrations at the city's main train station. The applause after the \\"Prisoners' Chorus\\" interrupted the performance for considerable time, and the production by Christine Mielitz?(de) had the chorus appear in normal street clothes at the end, signifying their role as representatives of the audience.[9] Four weeks later, on 9 November 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall signalled the end of East Germany's regime.\\r\\nBeethoven struggled to produce an appropriate overture for Fidelio, and ultimately went through four versions. His first attempt, for the 1805 premiere, is believed to have been the overture now known as \\"Leonore No.?2\\". Beethoven then focused this version for the performances of 1806, creating \\"Leonore No.?3\\". The latter is considered by many listeners as the greatest of the four overtures, but as an intensely dramatic, full-scale symphonic movement it had the effect of overwhelming the (rather light) initial scenes of the opera. Beethoven accordingly experimented with cutting it back somewhat, for a planned 1808 performance in Prague; this is believed to be the version now called \\"Leonore No.?1\\". Finally, for the 1814 revival Beethoven began anew, and with fresh musical material wrote what we now know as the Fidelio overture. As this somewhat lighter overture seems to work best of the four as a start to the opera, Beethoven's final intentions are generally respected in contemporary productions.\\r\\nWhile some believe that Gustav Mahler introduced the practice of performing \\"Leonore No.?3\\" between the two scenes of the second act, something which was common until the middle of the twentieth century, Cairns states that it goes back to the middle of the 19th century and was therefore prior to Mahler.[10] In this location, it acts as a kind of musical reprise of the rescue scene that has just taken place. A new, modern-styled production that premiered in Budapest in October 2008, for example, features the \\"Leonore No. 3\\" overture in this location.[11]\\r\\nTwo years prior to the opening scene, the Spanish nobleman Florestan has exposed or attempted to expose certain crimes of a rival nobleman, Pizarro. In revenge, Pizarro has secretly imprisoned Florestan in the prison over which he is governor. Simultaneously, Pizarro has spread false rumors about Florestan's death.\\r\\nThe warden of the prison, Rocco, has a daughter, Marzelline, and an assistant, Jaquino, who is in love with Marzelline. The faithful wife of Florestan, Leonore, suspects that her husband is still alive. Disguised as a boy, under the alias \\"Fidelio\\", she gains employment working for Rocco. As the boy Fidelio, she earns the favor of her employer, Rocco, and also the affections of his daughter Marzelline, much to Jaquino's chagrin.\\r\\nOn orders, Rocco has been giving the imprisoned Florestan diminishing rations until he is nearly starved to death.\\r\\nJaquino and Marzelline are alone in Rocco's house. Jaquino asks Marzelline when she will agree to marry him, but she says that she will never marry him now that she has fallen in love with Fidelio, unaware that Fidelio is actually Leonore in disguise (Jetzt, Sch?tzchen, jetzt sind wir allein\\"Now, darling, now we are alone\\"). Jaquino leaves, and Marzelline expresses her desire to become Fidelio's wife (O w?r ich schon mit dir vereint\\"If only I were already united with thee\\"). Rocco enters, looking for Fidelio, who then enters carrying a heavy load of newly-repaired chains. Rocco compliments Fidelio, and misinterprets her modest reply as hidden attraction to his daughter. Marzelline, Fidelio, Rocco, and Jaquino sing a quartet about the love Marzelline has for Fidelio (Mir ist so wunderbar\\"A wondrous feeling fills me\\", also known as the Canon Quartet).\\r\\nRocco tells Fidelio that as soon as the governor has left for Seville, Marzelline and Fidelio can be married. He tells them, however, that unless they have money, they will not be happy. (Hat man nicht auch Gold beineben\\"If you don't have money on you\\"). Fidelio demands to know why Rocco will not allow for help in the dungeons, especially as he always seems to return short of breath. Rocco says that there is a dungeon down there where he can never take Fidelio, which houses a man who has been wasting away for two years. Marzelline begs her father to keep Leonore away from such a terrible sight. Rocco and Leonore sing of courage (Gut, S?hnchen, gut\\"All right, sonny, all right\\"), and Marzelline joins in their acclamations.\\r\\nAll but Rocco leave. A march is played as Pizarro enters with his guards. Rocco warns Pizarro that the minister plans a surprise visit tomorrow to investigate accusations of Pizarro's cruelty. Pizarro exclaims that he cannot let the minister discover the imprisoned Florestan, who has been thought dead. Instead, Pizarro will have Florestan murdered (Ha, welch ein Augenblick\\"Hah! What a moment!\\"). As a signal, Pizarro orders that a trumpet be sounded at the minister's arrival. He offers Rocco money to kill Florestan, but Rocco refuses (Jetzt, Alter, jetzt hat es Eile!\\"Now, old man, we must hurry!\\"). Pizarro says he will kill Florestan himself instead, with Rocco forced to dig the grave in a ruined well in the dungeons. Once the grave is ready, Rocco is to sound the alarm, upon which Pizarro will come into the dungeon and kill Florestan. Fidelio, hearing Pizarro's plot, is agitated, but is soothed by thoughts of Florestan (Abscheulicher! Wo eilst du hin? and Komm, Hoffnung, lass den letzten Stern\\"Scum! Where are you off to so fast?\\" and \\"Come, hope, let the last star\\").\\r\\nJaquino once again begs Marzelline to marry him, but she continues to refuse. Fidelio, hoping to discover Florestan, asks Rocco to let the poor prisoners roam in the garden and enjoy the beautiful weather. Marzelline similarly begs him, and Rocco agrees to distract Pizarro while the prisoners are set free. The prisoners, ecstatic at their temporary freedom, sing joyfully (O welche Lust\\"O what a joy\\"), but remembering that they might be caught by the prison's governor Pizarro, are soon quiet.\\r\\nAfter meeting with Pizarro, Rocco reenters and tells Fidelio that Pizarro will allow the marriage, and Fidelio will also be permitted to join Rocco on his rounds in the dungeon (Nun sprecht, wie ging's?\\"Speak, how did it go?\\"). Rocco and Fidelio prepare to go to Florestan's cell, with the knowledge that he must be killed and buried within the hour. Fidelio is shaken; Rocco tries to discourage Fidelio from coming, but Fidelio insists. As they prepare to leave, Jaquino and Marzelline rush in and tell Rocco to run, as Pizarro has learned that the prisoners were allowed to roam, and is furious (Ach, Vater, Vater, eilt!\\"O, father, father, hurry!\\").\\r\\nBefore they can leave, Pizarro enters and demands an explanation. Rocco pretends that the prisoners were given a little freedom in honor of the Spanish king's name day, quietly suggesting that Pizarro save his anger for the prisoner in the dungeon below. Pizarro tells him to hurry and dig the grave, and then announces that the prisoners will be locked up again. Rocco, Leonore, Jacquino, and Marzelline reluctantly usher the prisoners back to their cells. (Leb wohl, du warmes Sonnenlicht\\"Farewell, you warm sunshine\\").\\r\\nFlorestan is alone in his cell, deep inside the dungeons. He sings first of his trust in God, and then has a vision of his wife Leonore coming to save him (Gott! Welch Dunkel hier!\\"God! What darkness here\\" and In des Lebens Frhlingstagen\\"In the spring days of life\\"). Florestan collapses and falls asleep, while Rocco and Fidelio come to dig his grave. As they dig, Rocco urges Fidelio to hurry (Wie kalt ist es in diesem unterirdischen Gew?lbe!\\"How cold it is in this underground chamber\\" and Nur hurtig fort, nur frisch gegraben\\"Come get to work and dig\\", the \\"Gravedigging Duet\\").\\r\\nFlorestan awakes and Fidelio recognizes him. When Florestan learns that the prison he is in belongs to Pizarro, he asks that a message be sent to his wife, Leonore, but Rocco says that it is impossible. Florestan begs for a drop to drink, and Rocco tells Fidelio to give him one. Florestan does not recognize Fidelio, his wife Leonore in disguise, but tells Fidelio that there will be reward for the good deed in Heaven (Euch werde Lohn in bessern Welten\\"You shall be rewarded in better worlds\\"). Fidelio further begs Rocco to be allowed to give Florestan a crust of bread, and Rocco consents.\\r\\nRocco obeys his orders and sounds the alarm for Pizarro, who appears and asks if all is ready. Rocco says that it is, and instructs Fidelio to leave the dungeon, but Fidelio hides instead. Pizarro reveals his identity to Florestan, who accuses him of murder (Er sterbe! Doch er soll erst wissen\\"Let him die! But first he should know\\"). As Pizarro brandishes a dagger, Fidelio leaps between him and Florestan and reveals her identity as Leonore, the wife of Florestan. Pizarro raises his dagger to kill her, but she pulls a gun and threatens to shoot him.\\r\\nJust then, the trumpet is heard, announcing the arrival of the minister. Jaquino enters, followed by soldiers, to announce that the minister is waiting at the gate. Rocco tells the soldiers to escort Governor Pizarro upstairs. Florestan and Leonore sing to their victory as Pizarro declares that he will have revenge, while Rocco expresses his fear of what is to come (Es schl?gt der Rache Stunde\\"Revenge's bell tolls\\"). Together, Florestan and Leonore sing a love duet (O namenlose Freude!\\"O unnamed joy!\\").\\r\\nHere, the overture \\"Leonore No. 3\\" is sometimes played.\\r\\nThe prisoners and townsfolk sing to the day and hour of justice which has come (Heil sei dem Tag!\\"Hail to the day!\\"). The minister, Don Fernando, announces that tyranny has ended. Rocco enters, with Leonore and Florestan, and he asks Don Fernando to help them (Wohlan, so helfet! Helft den Armen!\\"So help! Help the poor ones!\\"). Rocco explains how Leonore disguised herself as Fidelio to save her husband. Previously in love with Fidelio, Marzelline is shocked. Rocco describes Pizarro's murder plot, and Pizarro is led away to prison. Florestan is released from his chains by Leonore, and the crowd sings the praises of Leonore, the loyal savior of her husband (Wer ein holdes Weib errungen\\"Who has got a good wife\\").\\r\\nThe orchestra consists of 1 piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 2 trombones, timpani, and strings. There is also an offstage trumpet.\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nSources","input":"What is the name of beethoven's only opera?"},{"output":"infielder","context":"As player\\r\\nAs manager\\r\\nAs coach\\r\\nJos Alexander Cora (born October 18, 1975) is a Puerto Rican professional baseball coach and former infielder. He is currently the manager of the Boston Red Sox. He played in MLB for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, New York Mets, Texas Rangers, and Washington Nationals from 1998 through 2011. Cora was formerly a baseball analyst for ESPN and played college baseball at the University of Miami.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCora was drafted in the 12th round of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft by the Minnesota Twins, but did not sign a contract and decided instead to play collegiate baseball at the University of Miami. While there, Cora was named to the College World Series all-tournament team in both 1995 and 1996. He led the team to the title game in 1996, a game they lost to Louisiana State University.\\r\\nCora was rated by Baseball America as the best collegiate defensive player going into the 1996 draft. Cora was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the third round, and played 61 games of the 1996 season with the Class A-Advanced Vero Beach Dodgers, batting .257 with no home runs and 26 RBIs. He played the 1997 season with the Double-A San Antonio Missions; in 127 games he batted .234 with 3 home runs and 48 RBIs. Cora spent parts of the 1998, 1999, and 2000 seasons with the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes, hitting .264 in 81 games, .308 in 80 games, and .373 in 30 games, respectively.\\r\\nCora made his major league debut on June 7, 1998, with the Dodgers against the Seattle Mariners; his brother Joey Cora was Seattle's starting second baseman in the game.[1] Alex Cora spent the next seven years in Los Angeles, appearing in a total of 684 games while batting .246 with 27 home runs and 173 RBIs. During his time with the Dodgers, he played at second base and shortstop. During the 2000 and 2001 seasons, Cora mostly played shortstop as the Dodgers moved the aging Mark Grudzielanek to second base. With the emergence of Csar Izturis in 2002, and the trade of Grudzielanek to the Chicago Cubs in December of the same year, Cora spent the rest of his stint with the Dodgers as their primary second baseman.\\r\\nCora played in one postseason series with the Dodgers, the 2004 NLDS, which the Dodgers lost to the St. Louis Cardinals. Cora was the Dodgers' second baseman in all four games, batting 2-for-15 (.133) during the series.\\r\\nIn January 2005, Cora signed as a free agent with the Cleveland Indians, where he appeared in 49 games, with 22 starts at shortstop and 14 at second base; he batted .205 with a home run and 8 RBIs. On July 7, 2005, Cora was traded to the Boston Red Sox for infielder Ram܇n Vzquez.\\r\\nCora made his Red Sox debut on July 7, 2005, and through the end of the regular season appeared in a total of 47 games for Boston, batting .269 with 2 home runs and 16 RBIs. In the 2005 ALDS, which Boston lost to the Chicago White Sox in a three-game sweep, Cora played in one game as a defensive replacement, without a plate appearance.\\r\\nCora was originally intended to backup shortstop dgar Rentera. With the trade of Rentera to the Atlanta Braves in December 2005, Cora was being eyed to take the position of starting shortstop, until the Red Sox acquired lex Gonzlez in February 2006. For the 2006 season, Cora appeared in 96 games, batting .238 with one home run and 18 RBIs.\\r\\nCora was a member of the Red Sox team that won the 2007 World Series. During the regular season, he appeared in 83 games and batted .246 with 3 home runs and 18 RBIs. In the postseason, he appeared as a late-innings defensive replacement in two games of the 2007 ALCS and two games of the World Series. He had one plate appearance, a sacrifice bunt in World Series game 3.\\r\\nFor the 2008 regular season, Cora played in 75 games, batting .270 with no home runs and 9 RBIs. He appeared in four postseason games; two games of the 2008 ALDS, which Boston won, and two games of the 2008 ALCS, which Boston lost. He batted 4-for-26 (.154) with no home runs and one RBI. These games were the final postseason appearances for Cora as a player.\\r\\nOn October 30, 2008, Cora became a free agent. In his four seasons with Boston, he appeared in 301 regular season games, batting .252 with 6 home runs and 61 RBIs.\\r\\nOn January 22, 2009, Cora signed a one-year deal with the New York Mets.[2] During the 2009 season, he appeared in 82 games, batting .251 with one home run and 18 RBIs. In November 2009, Cora re-signed with the Mets for the 2010 season, with an option for 2011. He was released by the Mets on August 7, 2010[3]  at the time, he was batting .207 with no home runs and 20 RBIs, having played in 62 games of the 2010 season. In his time with the Mets, Cora appeared in a total of 144 games, with a .234 batting average, 1 home run, and 38 RBIs.\\r\\nOn August 17, 2010, Cora signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers, and was assigned to their Triple-A affiliate Oklahoma City, where he appeared in 6 games, batting 4-for-22 (.182). He then played four games for the Rangers, batting 2-for-7 (.286). The Rangers released Cora on September 7. Despite his limited time with Texas, the team later rewarded him with an AL Championship ring.\\r\\nIn January 2011, the Nationals signed Cora to a minor league contract.[4] During the 2011 season, he appeared in 91 games for Washington, batting .224 with no home runs and 6 RBIs. Cora's final MLB appearance was with the Nationals on September 28, 2011, when he tripled as a pinch hitter against the Florida Marlins.[5]\\r\\nFollowing the 2011 season, Cora played winter baseball in Puerto Rico, after which he announced his retirement; shortly thereafter he clarified that he was retiring only from winter baseball.[6] He agreed to a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals on February 5, 2012.[7] After batting .208 with one RBI in 24 plate appearances in spring training, Cora was released by the defending World Series champions on March 25, 2012.[8]\\r\\nWith the Dodgers on May 12, 2004, Cora had an 18-pitch at-bat against Chicago Cubs starting pitcher Matt Clement. Facing a 2ÿ1 count, Cora fouled off 14 straight pitches before finally hitting a home run.[9] It is the third longest documented at-bat since baseball statisticians began keeping track of pitch counts in the mid-1980s.[10] So much time elapsed that Cora's brother Joey joked that he and a friend were watching the game at a restaurant, ordering their first beer during the first pitch, and by the time Cora homered they were \\"so drunk that we had to call a cab to take us home.\\"[11]\\r\\nCora played in the two longest nine-inning games in MLB history. The first was a 4-hour, 27-minute game on October 5, 2001, between the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants.[12] The second game, and the longest on record, was a 4-hour, 45-minute game on August 18, 2006, the second game of a doubleheader between the Red Sox and the New York Yankees.[12] Cora entered the 2001 game as a defensive replacement in the eighth inning,[13] and was the starting shortstop in the 2006 game.[14]\\r\\nCora played for Puerto Rico in both the 2006 and 2009 World Baseball Classics; he batted 2-for-15 (.133) and 1-for-8 (.125) in those tournaments, respectively.[15] Currently, Cora is the general manager of the Puerto Rico national baseball team.[16]\\r\\nFrom February 2013 to 2016, Cora was a color analyst for baseball on ESPN and ESPN Deportes.[17]\\r\\nOn November 15, 2016, Cora became the bench coach for the Houston Astros.[18] Cora assumed managerial duties on three occasions during the 2017 season, following ejections of Astros manager A.J. Hinch.[19][20][21][22]\\r\\nOn August 25, 2017, Cora was ejected from a game against the Los Angeles Angels by home plate umpire Laz Daz.[23] Cora argued that the baseball had too much dirt on it and should be removed from play; this was Cora's first career MLB ejection.[24]\\r\\nDuring the 2017 ALCS, Cora interviewed for the open managerial position of the Boston Red Sox.[25] It was subsequently reported that Cora would be named as Red Sox manager.[26][27] On October 22, the day after the Astros defeated the New York Yankees in the ALCS, the Red Sox announced a three-year managerial contract for Cora, for the 2018 through 2020 seasons, with an option for 2021.[28] He formally assumed the role on November 2, 2017, following the World Series.\\r\\nCora lives in Caguas, Puerto Rico, during the off-season.

Synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction begins when an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal of a motor neuron, which activates voltage-dependent calcium channels to allow calcium ions to enter the neuron. Calcium ions bind to sensor proteins (synaptotagmin) on synaptic vesicles, triggering vesicle fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent neurotransmitter release from the motor neuron into the synaptic cleft. In vertebrates, motor neurons release acetylcholine (ACh), a small molecule neurotransmitter, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber, also known as the sarcolemma. nAChRs are ionotropic receptors, meaning they serve as ligand-gated ion channels. The binding of ACh to the receptor can depolarize the muscle fiber, causing a cascade that eventually results in muscle contraction.\\r\\nNeuromuscular junction diseases can be of genetic and autoimmune origin. Genetic disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, can arise from mutated structural proteins that comprise the neuromuscular junction, whereas autoimmune diseases, such as myasthenia gravis, occur when antibodies are produced against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the sarcolemma.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neuromuscular junction differs from chemical synapses between neurons. Presynaptic motor axons stop 30 nanometers from the sarcolemma, the cell membrane of a muscle cell. This 30-nanometer space forms the synaptic cleft through which signalling molecules are released. The sarcolemma has invaginations called postjunctional folds, which increase the surface area of the membrane exposed to the synaptic cleft.[2] These postjunctional folds form what is referred to as the motor endplate, which possess nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at a density of 10,000 receptors/micrometer2 in skeletal muscle.[3] The presynaptic axons form bulges called terminal boutons (or presynaptic terminals) that project into the postjunctional folds of the sarcolemma. The presynaptic terminals have active zones that contain vesicles, also called quanta, full of acetylcholine molecules. These vesicles can fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release ACh molecules into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis after depolarization.[2] AChRs are localized opposite the presynaptic terminals by protein scaffolds at the postjunctional folds of the sarcolemma. Dystrophin, a structural protein, connects the sarcomere, sarcolemma, and extracellular matrix components. Rapsyn is another protein that docks AChRs and structural proteins to the cytoskeleton. Also present is the receptor tyrosine kinase protein MuSK, a signaling protein involved in the development of the neuromuscular junction, which is also held in place by rapsyn.[2]\\r\\nThe neuromuscular junction is where a neuron activates a muscle to contract. Upon the arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic neuron terminal, voltage-dependent calcium channels open and Ca2+ ions flow from the extracellular fluid into the presynaptic neuron's cytosol. This influx of Ca2+ causes neurotransmitter-containing vesicles to dock and fuse to the presynaptic neuron's cell membrane through SNARE proteins. Fusion of the vesicular membrane with the presynaptic cell membrane results in the emptying of the vesicle's contents (acetylcholine) into the synaptic cleft, a process known as exocytosis. Acetylcholine diffuses into the synaptic cleft and can bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the motor endplate, causing calcium ions to flow into the muscle cell, initiating a sequence of steps that finally produce muscle contraction.\\r\\nAcetylcholine is a neurotransmitter synthesized from dietary choline and acetyl-CoA (ACoA), and is involved in the stimulation of muscle tissue in vertebrates as well as in some invertebrate animals. In vertebrate animals, the acetylcholine receptor subtype that is found at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a ligand-gated ion channel. Each subunit of this receptor has a characteristic \\"cys-loop\\", which is composed of a cysteine residue followed by 13 amino acid residues and another cysteine residue. The two cysteine residues form a disulfide linkage which results in the \\"cys-loop\\" receptor that is capable of binding acetylcholine and other ligands. These cys-loop receptors are found only in eukaryotes, but prokaryotes possess ACh receptors with similar properties.[3] Not all species use a cholinergic neuromuscular junction; e.g. crayfish and fruit flies have a glutamatergic neuromuscular junction.[2]\\r\\nAChRs at the skeletal neuromuscular junction form heteropentamers composed of two ϫ, one , one ?, and one Ѵ subunits.[4] When a single ACh ligand binds to one of the ϫ subunits of the ACh receptor it induces a conformational change at the interface with the second AChR ϫ subunit. This conformational change results in the increased affinity of the second ϫ subunit for a second ACh ligand. AChRs therefore exhibit a sigmoidal dissociation curve due to this cooperative binding.[3] The presence of the inactive, intermediate receptor structure with a single-bound ligand keeps ACh in the synapse that might otherwise be lost by cholinesterase hydrolysis or diffusion. The persistence of these ACh ligands in the synapse can cause a prolonged post-synaptic response.[5]\\r\\nThe development of the neuromuscular junction requires signaling from both the motor neuron's terminal and the muscle cell's central region, During development, muscle cells produce acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and express them in the central regions in a process called prepatterning. Agrin, a heparin proteoglycan, and MuSK kinase are thought to help stabilize the accumulation of AChR in the central regions of the myocyte. MuSK is a receptor tyrosine kinasemeaning that it induces cellular signaling by binding phosphate molecules to self regions like tyrosines, and to other targets in the cytoplasm.[6] Upon activation by its ligand agrin, MuSK signals via two proteins called \\"Dok-7\\" and \\"rapsyn\\", to induce \\"clustering\\" of acetylcholine receptors.[7] ACh release by developing motor neurons produces postsynaptic potentials in the muscle cell that positively reinforces the localization and stabilization of the developing neuromuscular junction.[8]\\r\\nThese findings were demonstrated in part by mouse \\"knockout\\" studies. In mice which are deficient for either agrin or MuSK, the neuromuscular junction does not form. Further, mice deficient in Dok-7 did not form either acetylcholine receptor clusters or neuromuscular synapses.[9]\\r\\nThe development of neuromuscular junctions is mostly studied in model organisms, such as rodents. In addition, in 2015 an all-human neuromuscular junction has been created in vitro using human embryonic stem cells and somatic muscle stem cells.[10] In this model presynaptic motor neurons are activated by optogenetics and in response synaptically connected muscle fibers twitch upon light stimulation.\\r\\nJos del Castillo and Bernard Katz used ionophoresis to determine the location and density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. With this technique, a microelectrode was placed inside the motor endplate of the muscle fiber, and a micropipette filled with acetylcholine (ACh) is placed directly in front of the endplate in the synaptic cleft. A positive voltage was applied to the tip of the micropipette, which caused a burst of positively charged ACh molecules to be released from the pipette. These ligands flowed into the space representing the synaptic cleft and bound to AChRs. The intracellular microelectrode monitored the amplitude of the depolarization of the motor endplate in response to ACh binding to nicotinic (ionotropic) receptors. Katz and del Castillo showed that the amplitude of the depolarization (excitatory postsynaptic potential) depended on the proximity of the micropipette releasing the ACh ions to the endplate. The farther the micropipette was from the motor endplate, the smaller the depolarization was in the muscle fiber. This allowed the researchers to determine that the nicotinic receptors were localized to the motor endplate in high density.[2][3]\\r\\nToxins are also used to determine the location of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. ϫ-Bungarotoxin is a toxin found in the snake species Bungarus multicinctus that acts as an ACh antagonist and binds to AChRs irreversibly. By coupling assayable enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the ϫ-bungarotoxin, AChRs can be visualized and quantified.[2]\\r\\nNerve gases and liquor damage this area.\\r\\nBotulinum toxin (aka botulinum neurotoxin, BoNT, and sold under the trade name Botox) inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by interfering with SNARE proteins.[2] This toxin crosses into the nerve terminal through the process of endocytosis and subsequently interferes with SNARE proteins, which are necessary for ACh release. By doing so, it induces a transient flaccid paralysis and chemical denervation localized to the striated muscle that it has affected. The inhibition of the ACh release does not set in until approximately two weeks after the injection is made. Three months after the inhibition occurs, neuronal activity begins to regain partial function, and six months, complete neuronal function is regained.[11]\\r\\nTetanus toxin, also known as tetanospasmin is a potent neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani and causes the disease state, tetanus. The LD50 of this toxin has been measured to be approximately 1?ng/kg, making it second only to Botulinum toxin D as the deadliest toxin in the world. It functions very similarly to botunlinum neurotoxin (BoNT) by attaching and endocytosing into the presynaptic nerve terminal and interfering with SNARE protein complexes. It differs from BoNT in a few ways, most apparently in its end state, wherein tetanospasmin demonstrates a rigid / spastic paralysis as opposed to the flaccid paralysis demonstrated with BoNT.\\r\\nLatrotoxin (ϫ-Latrotoxin) found in venom of widow spiders also affects the neuromuscular junction by causing the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic cell. Mechanisms of action include binding to receptors on the presynaptic cell activating the IP3/DAG pathway and release of calcium from intracellular stores and pore formation resulting in influx of calcium ions directly. Either mechanism causes increased calcium in presynaptic cell, which then leads to release of synaptic vesicles of acetylcholine. Latrotoxin causes pain, muscle contraction and if untreated potentially paralysis and death.\\r\\nSnake venoms act as toxins at the neuromuscular junction and can induce weakness and paralysis. Venoms can act as both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins.[12]\\r\\nPresynaptic neurotoxins, commonly known as -neurotoxins, affect the presynaptic regions of the neuromuscular junction. The majority of these neurotoxins act by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, into the synapse between neurons. However, some of these toxins have also been known to enhance neurotransmitter release. Those that inhibit neurotransmitter release create a neuromuscular blockade that prevents signaling molecules from reaching their postsynaptic target receptors. In doing so, the victim of these snake bite suffer from profound weakness. Such neurotoxins do not respond well to anti-venoms. After one hour of inoculation of these toxins, including notexin and taipoxin, many of the affected nerve terminals show signs of irreversible physical damage, leaving them devoid of any synaptic vesicles.[12]\\r\\nPostsynaptic neurotoxins, otherwise known as ϫ-neurotoxins, act oppositely to the presynaptic neurotoxins by binding to the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. This prevents interaction between the acetylcholine released by the presynaptic terminal and the receptors on the postsynaptic cell. In effect, the opening of sodium channels associated with these acetylcholine receptors is prohibited, resulting in a neuromuscular blockade, similar to the effects seen due to presynaptic neurotoxins. This causes paralysis in the muscles involved in the affected junctions. Unlike presynaptic neurotoxins, postsynaptic toxins are more easily affected by anti-venoms, which accelerate the dissociation of the toxin from the receptors, ultimately causing a reversal of paralysis. These neurotoxins experimentally and qualitatively aid in the study of acetylcholine receptor density and turnover, as well as in studies observing the direction of antibodies toward the affected acetylcholine receptors in patients diagnosed with myasthenia gravis.[12]\\r\\nAny disorder that compromises the synaptic transmission between a motor neuron and a muscle cell is categorized under the umbrella term of neuromuscular diseases. These disorders can be inherited or acquired and can vary in their severity and mortality. In general, most of these disorders tend to be caused by mutations or autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders, in the case of neuromuscular diseases, tend to be humoral mediated, B cell mediated, and result in an antibody improperly created against a motor neuron or muscle fiber protein that interferes with synaptic transmission or signaling.\\r\\nMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder where the body makes antibodies against either the acetylcholine receptor (AchR) (in 80% of cases), or against postsynaptic muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) (0ÿ10% of cases). In seronegative myasthenia gravis low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 is targeted by IgG1, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of its ligand, preventing the ligand from binding its receptor. It is not known if seronegative myasthenia gravis will respond to standard therapies.[13]\\r\\nNeonatal MG is an autoimmune disorder that affects 1 in 8 children born to mothers who have been diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG). MG can be transferred from the mother to the fetus by the movement of AChR antibodies through the placenta. Signs of this disease at birth include weakness, which responds to anticholinesterase medications, as well as fetal akinesia, or the lack of fetal movement. This form of the disease is transient, lasting for about three months. However, in some cases, neonatal MG can lead to other health effects, such as arthrogryposis and even fetal death. These conditions are thought to be initiated when maternal AChR antibodies are directed to the fetal AChR and can last until the 33rd week of gestation, when the  subunit of AChR is replaced by the  subunit.[14]\\r\\nLambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction. This rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms: proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and areflexia.[15] Proximal muscle weakness is a product of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell. Examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by LEMS include erectile dysfunction in men, constipation, and, most commonly, dry mouth. Less common dysfunctions include dry eyes and altered perspiration. Areflexia is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise.[16]\\r\\n50ÿ60% of the patients that are diagnosed with LEMS also have present an associated tumor, which is typically small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). This type of tumor also expresses voltage-gated calcium channels.[16] Oftentimes, LEMS also occurs alongside myasthenia gravis.[15]\\r\\nTreatment for LEMS consists of using 3,4-diaminopyridine as a first measure, which serves to increase the compound muscle action potential as well as muscle strength by lengthening the time that voltage-gated calcium channels remain open after blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. In the US, treatment with 3,4-diaminopyridine for eligible LEMS patients is available at no cost under an expanded access program.[17][18] Further treatment includes the use of prednisone and azathioprine in the event that 3,4-diaminopyridine does not aid in treatment.[16]\\r\\nNeuromyotonia (NMT), otherwise known as Isaacs syndrome, is unlike many other diseases present at the neuromuscular junction. Rather than causing muscle weakness, NMT leads to the hyperexcitation of motor nerves. NMT causes this hyperexcitation by producing longer depolarizations by down-regulating voltage-gated potassium channels, which causes greater neurotransmitter release and repetitive firing. This increase in rate of firing leads to more active transmission and as a result, greater muscular activity in the affected individual. NMT is also believed to be of autoimmune origin due to its associations with autoimmune symptoms in the individual affected.[14]\\r\\nCongenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are very similar to both MG and LEMS in their functions, but the primary difference between CMS and those diseases is that CMS is of genetic origins. Specifically, these syndromes are diseases incurred due to mutations, typically recessive, in 1 of at least 10 genes that affect presynaptic, synaptic, and postsynaptic proteins in the neuromuscular junction. Such mutations usually arise in the -subunit of AChR,[14] thereby affecting the kinetics and expression of the receptor itself. Single nucleotide substitutions or deletions may cause loss of function in the subunit. Other mutations, such as those affecting acetylcholinesterase and acetyltransferase, can also cause the expression of CMS, with the latter being associated specifically with episodic apnea.[19] These syndromes can present themselves at different times within the life of an individual. They may arise during the fetal phase, causing fetal akinesia, or the perinatal period, during which certain conditions, such as arthrogryposis, ptosis, hypotonia, ophthalmoplegia, and feeding or breathing difficulties, may be observed. They could also activate during adolescence or adult years, causing the individual to develop slow-channel syndrome.[14]\\r\\nTreatment for particular subtypes of CMS (postsynaptic fast-channel CMS)[20][21] is similar to treatment for other neuromuscular disorders. 3,4-Diaminopyridine, the first-line treatment for LEMS, is under development as an orphan drug for CMS[22] in the US, and available to eligible patients under an expanded access program at no cost.[17][18]\\r\\nBulbospinal muscular atrophy, also known as Kennedys disease, is a rare recessive trinucleotide, polyglutamine disorder that is linked to the X chromosome. Because of its linkage to the X chromosome, it is typically transmitted through females. However, Kennedys disease is only present in adult males and the onset of the disease is typically later in life. This disease is specifically caused by the expansion of a CAG-tandem repeat in exon 1 found on the androgen-receptor (AR) gene on chromosome Xq11-12. Poly-Q-expanded AR accumulates in the nuclei of cells, where it begins to fragment. After fragmentation, degradation of the cell begins, leading to a loss of both motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia.[23]\\r\\nSymptoms of Kennedys disease include weakness and wasting of the facial bulbar and extremity muscles, as well as sensory and endocrinological disturbances, such as gynecomastia and reduced fertility. Other symptoms include elevated testosterone and other sexual hormone levels, development of hyper-CK-emia, abnormal conduction through motor and sensory nerves, and neuropathic or in rare cases myopathic alterations on biopsies of muscle cells.[23]\\r\\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked genetic disorder that results in the absence of the structural protein dystrophin at the neuromuscular junction. It affects 1 in 3,600ÿ6,000 males and frequently causes death by the age of 30. The absence of dystrophin causes muscle degeneration, and patients present with the following symptoms: abnormal gait, hypertrophy in the calf muscles, and elevated creatine kinase. If left untreated, patients may suffer from respiratory distress, which can lead to death.[24]","input":"What affect does acetylcholine have on the sarcolemma?"},{"output":"lunula","context":"The lunula, or lunulae (pl.)

While the rapid strep test is quicker, it has a lower sensitivity (70%) and statistically equal specificity (98%) as a throat culture.[8] In areas of the world where rheumatic fever is uncommon, a negative rapid strep test is sufficient to rule out the disease.[16]\\r\\nA positive throat culture or RADT in association with symptoms establishes a positive diagnosis in those in which the diagnosis is in doubt.[17] In adults, a negative RADT is sufficient to rule out the diagnosis. However, in children a throat culture is recommended to confirm the result.[6] Asymptomatic individuals should not be routinely tested with a throat culture or RADT because a certain percentage of the population persistently \\"carries\\" the streptococcal bacteria in their throat without any harmful results.[17]\\r\\nAs the symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis overlap with other conditions, it can be difficult to make the diagnosis clinically.[8] Coughing, nasal discharge, diarrhea, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat.[8] The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever, and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in infectious mononucleosis.[18]\\r\\nTonsillectomy may be a reasonable preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year).[19] However, the benefits are small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken.[20][21][22] Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent a person who is a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections.[6] Treating people who have been exposed but who are without symptoms is not recommended.[6] Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.[6]\\r\\nUntreated streptococcal pharyngitis usually resolves within a few days.[8] Treatment with antibiotics shortens the duration of the acute illness by about 16?hours.[8] The primary reason for treatment with antibiotics is to reduce the risk of complications such as rheumatic fever and retropharyngeal abscesses.[8] Antibiotics prevent acute rheumatic fever if given within 9 days of the onset of symptoms.[11]\\r\\nPain medication such as NSAIDs and paracetamol (acetaminophen) helps in the management of pain associated with strep throat.[23] Viscous lidocaine may also be useful.[24] While steroids may help with the pain,[11][25] they are not routinely recommended.[6] Aspirin may be used in adults but is not recommended in children due to the risk of Reye syndrome.[11]\\r\\nThe antibiotic of choice in the United States for streptococcal pharyngitis is penicillin V, due to safety, cost, and effectiveness.[8] Amoxicillin is preferred in Europe.[26] In India, where the risk of rheumatic fever is higher, intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is the first choice for treatment.[11]\\r\\nAppropriate antibiotics decrease the average 3ÿ5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness.[17] They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess.[27] The arguments in favor of antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects,[10] and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications.[27][28] Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.[29]\\r\\nErythromycin and other macrolides or clindamycin are recommended for people with severe penicillin allergies.[8][6] First-generation cephalosporins may be used in those with less severe allergies[8] and some evidence supports cephalosporins as superior to penicillin.[30][31] Streptococcal infections may also lead to acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this side effect is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.[11]\\r\\nThe symptoms of strep throat usually improve within three to five days, irrespective of treatment.[17] Treatment with antibiotics reduces the risk of complications and transmission; children may return to school 24 hours after antibiotics are administered.[8] The risk of complications in adults is low.[6] In children, acute rheumatic fever is rare in most of the developed world. It is, however, the leading cause of acquired heart disease in India, sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of Australia.[6]\\r\\nComplications arising from streptococcal throat infections include:\\r\\nThe economic cost of the disease in the United States in children is approximately $350 million annually.[6]\\r\\nPharyngitis, the broader category into which Streptococcal pharyngitis falls, is diagnosed in 11 million people annually in the United States.[8] It is the cause of 15ÿ40% of sore throats among children[5][8] and 5ÿ15% in adults.[6] Cases usually occur in late winter and early spring.[8]","input":"What is the organism that causes strep throat?"},{"output":"George V","context":"","input":"Who was the queen of britain during ww1?"},{"output":"June 27, 2003","context":"The National Do Not Call Registry is a database maintained by the United States federal government, listing the telephone numbers of individuals and families who have requested that telemarketers not contact them.[1] Certain callers are required by federal law to respect this request. Separate laws and regulations apply to robocalls in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 27, 2003, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opened the National Do Not Call Registry in order to comply with the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act of 2003 (Pub.L. 108ÿ10, was H.R. 395, and codified at 15 U.S.C.??6101 et. seq.), sponsored by Representatives Billy Tauzin and John Dingell and signed into law by President George W.

The law established the FTC's National Do Not Call Registry in order to facilitate compliance with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.\\r\\nRegistration for the Do-Not-Call list began on June 27, 2003, and enforcement started on October 1, 2003. Since January 1, 2005, telemarketers covered by the registry have up to 31 days (initially the period was 90 days) from the date a number is registered to cease calling that number. Originally, phone numbers remained on the registry for a period of five years, but are now permanent because of the Do-Not-Call Improvement Act of 2007, effective February 2008.[2]\\r\\nConsumers may add landline or cellular numbers to the registry,[3] but FCC regulations prohibit telemarketers from calling a cellular phone number with an automatic dialer under almost all circumstances.[3][4] In 2005, a rumor began circulating via e-mail that cell phone providers were planning on making their number directories available to telemarketers. The FTC responded by clarifying that cell phones cannot be called by telemarketers.[5] Similarly, fax numbers do not need to be included in the registry due to existing federal laws and regulations that prohibit the sending of unsolicited faxes.\\r\\nIf a person does not want to register a number on the national registry, he or she can still prohibit individual telemarketers from calling by asking the caller to put the called number on the companys do-not-call list.\\r\\nThe do-not-call list was slated to take effect on October 1, 2003, but two federal district court decisions almost delayed it. One from Oklahoma was overcome by special legislation giving the FTC specific jurisdiction over the matter. The other from Colorado revolved around questions of regulation of commercial speech and threatened to delay implementation of the list. However, President Bush signed a bill authorizing the no-call list to go ahead in September 2003. Finally, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on February 17, 2004, upheld the constitutionality of the law.[6]\\r\\nPlacing one's number on the National Do Not Call Registry will stop some, but not all, unsolicited calls. The following are exceptions granted by existing laws and regulationsand these types of organizations can register with donotcall.gov and can purchase telephone lists from the Do Not Call Registry[7]\\r\\nSome attempts have been made by telemarketers to skirt the do-not-call list rules. An example is the Dove Foundation, which places \\"survey\\" calls and then requests permission for a follow-up call. The follow-up call is conducted by a for-profit company attempting to sell products. This operation resulted in a restraining order in Missouri in March 2006.[12]\\r\\nComplaints concerning telemarketing calls to homes and personal cell phones can be made to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission[13] and the Federal Trade Commission.[14]\\r\\nThe Federal Communications Commission has created rules implementing the National Do-Not-Call Implementation Act.

Typically this includes facts such as when the call occurred, the phone number called, the calling organization, the goods or services being marketed, whether the caller has any exemption status. Details of these rules can be found on the FCC's complaint form.[13]\\r\\nMany journalists and victims of fraudulent calls and Do-Not-Call violations have extensively documented ongoing and widespread inaction and lack of enforcement by the FTC.[16]\\r\\nIn May 2014 Sprint Corporation was fined a record $7.5 million for failing to honor requests by consumers to opt out of receiving telemarketing calls and texts. The fine followed an investigation that had begun in 2012. \\"We expect companies to respect the privacy of consumers who have opted out of marketing calls,\\" Travis LeBlanc, acting chief of the FCC's enforcement bureau, said at the time. \\"When a consumer tells a company to stop calling or texting with promotional pitches, that request must be honored. Today's settlement leaves no question that protecting consumer privacy is a top enforcement priority.\\"[17]\\r\\nOn February 15, 2008, U.S. President George W.

More recently, Richard Nixon (born 1913) ceased being the oldest living president when Ronald Reagan (born 1911) was inaugurated. Furthermore, although Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest ever to become both the oldest living president (at age 50) and a former president (at age 51), he was the only living president or former president by the end of his term.

Located in present-day San Diego, California, it was founded on July 16, 1769 by Spanish friar Junpero Serra in an area long inhabited by the Kumeyaay people. The mission and the surrounding area were named for the Catholic Didacus of Alcal, a Spaniard more commonly known as San Diego. The mission was the site of the first Christian burial in Alta California. San Diego is also generally regarded as the site of the region's first public execution, in 1778. Father Luis Jayme, California's first Christian martyr, lies entombed beneath the chancel floor. The current church, built in the early 19th century, is the fifth to stand on this location.[16][17] The mission site is a National Historic Landmark.[14][18]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former Spanish settlement at the Kumeyaay's Nipawai lies within that area occupied during the late Paleoindian period and continuing on into the present day by the Native society commonly known as the Diegue?o;[19] the name denotes those people who were ministered by the padres at Mission San Diego de Alcal.[20] Relatively, much is known about the native inhabitants in recent centuries, thanks in part to the efforts of the Spanish explorer Juan Rodrguez Cabrillo, who documented his observations of life in the coastal villages he encountered along the Southern California coast in October 1542.[21] Cabrillo, a Portuguese navigator in the service of Spain, is credited with the discovery of San Diego Bay. On the evening of September 28, 1542 the ships San Salvador and Victoria sailed into the harbor, whereupon Cabrillo christened it \\"San Miguel.\\"[22] During that expedition a landing party went ashore and briefly interacted with a small group of natives. Some sixty years later another Spanish explorer, Sebastin Vizcano, made landfall some ten miles from the present Mission site. Under Vizcano's command the San Diego, Santo Toms, and frigate Tres Reyes dropped anchor on November 10, 1602, and the port was renamed \\"San Diego de Alcal.\\"[23][24] It would be another 167 years before the Spanish returned to San Diego. Ever since the voyages of Christopher Columbus, the Kingdom of Spain sought to establish missions to convert the pagans in Nueva Espa?a (\\"New Spain\\") to Roman Catholicism to save souls, and in part, to facilitate colonization of these lands. However, it was not until 1741the time of the Vitus Bering expedition, when the territorial ambitions of Tsarist Russia towards North America became knownthat King Philip V felt such installations were necessary in Upper California.[25]\\r\\nIn 1769, Visitador General Jos de Glvez sent the expedition of Junpero Serra and Gaspar de Portol to found missions and presidios at San Diego and Monterey (see Timeline of the Portol expedition), thereby securing Spain's claim to the Pacific Coast harbors recommended by Cabrillo and Vizcaino.[26] Two groups traveled from Lower California on foot, while a pair of packet ships (bearing supplies) traveled up the coast from the Baja California Peninsula.[27][28]\\r\\nOn August 9, 1834 Governor Figueroa issued his \\"Decree of Confiscation.\\"[29] The missions were offered for sale to citizens, who were unable to come up with the price, so all mission property was broken up into ranchos and given to ex-military officers who had fought in the War of Independence against Spain. On June 8, 1846 Mission San Diego de Alcal was given to Santiago Argello by Governor Po Pico \\"...for services rendered to the government.\\"[30] After the United States annexed California, the Mission was used by the military from 1846 to 1862.\\r\\nPresident Abraham Lincoln signed a proclamation on May 23, 1862 that restored ownership of the Mission proper to the Roman Catholic Church.[31][32] When Mission San Diego de Alcal was granted back to the Church, it was in ruins. In the 1880s Father Anthony Ubach began to restore the old Mission buildings.\\r\\nFather Ubach died in 1907 and restoration work ceased until 1931. In 1941, the Mission once again became a parish church, in what is still an active parish serving the Diocese of San Diego. In 1976, Pope Paul VI designated the Mission church as a minor basilica.[18]\\r\\nMission San Diego de Alcal is located within San Diego city limits, near the intersection of Interstate 8 and Interstate 15, and approximately one mile east of Qualcomm Stadium. The parish is partially funded by a gift shop, and self-guided tours of the grounds and buildings are available to the public for a small donation.\\r\\nThe goal of the missions was, above all, to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming, therefore, was the most important industry of any mission. Prior to the establishment of the missions, the native peoples knew only how to utilize bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth. The missionaries discovered that the Indians, who regarded labor as degrading to the masculine, had to be taught industry in order to learn how to be self-supportive. The result was the establishment of a great manual training school that comprised agriculture, the mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. Everything consumed and otherwise utilized by the natives was produced at the missions under the supervision of the padres; thus, the neophytes not only supported themselves, but after 1811 sustained the entire military and civil government of California.[34] Wheat, corn, wine grapes, barley, beans, cattle, horses, and sheep were the major crops at San Diego. In 1795, construction on a system of aqueducts was begun to bring water to the fields and the Mission (the first irrigation project in Upper California).[35] The building manager was Fray Pedro Panto, who was poisoned by his Indian cook Nazario before the project was completed.[36] In his testimony, in the trial that followed, Nazario stated that he had poisoned the friar due to constant beatings inflicted by Friar Panto.[37]\\r\\nThe Mission San Diego was primarily supported from lands included in a Spanish royal land grant, encompassing roughly the eastern third of the current City of San Diego, as well as most of the cities of La Mesa and Lemon Grove. While not exact, its boundaries are roughly Interstate 805, Miramar Road, Route 125 (California), Skyline Drive and Division Street. Boundary Street (which parallels Interstate 805 in the neighborhood of North Park) lies directly on one portion of the boundary and draws its name from it.\\r\\nThe first vinyards planted in California, were planted at the mission in 1769.[38] Father Junpero Serra planted these initial vines.[39] The vines were of the Mission variety, which were bright to Mexico in the 16th Century.[40] Unfortunately, the initial plantings did not survive, with Mission San Juan Capistrano having the first surviving plantings.[41] By at least 1781, wine was being produced at the mission.[42] One source claims that the vineyard on mission lands reached up to fifty thousand acres.[43] The mission vineyards were around until at least 1823.[44]\\r\\nBells were vitally important to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with ringing the mission bells. This mission had five bells.\\r\\nAsistencias\\r\\nEstancias\\r\\nMilitary districts\\r\\nSee also","input":"Who was the san diego mission named after?"},{"output":"John F.

The New-York Historical Society presents exhibitions, public programs, and research that explore the rich history of New York and the nation. The New-York Historical Society Museum & Library has been at its present location since 1908. The granite building was designed by York & Sawyer in a classic Roman Eclectic style. A renovation of the landmark building was completed in November 2011 that made it more open to the public, provided space for an interactive children's museum, and accomplished other changes to enhance access to its collections.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouise Mirrer has been the president of the Historical Society since 2004. She was previously Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs of the City University of New York.[1] Beginning in 2005, the museum presented a groundbreaking two-year exhibit on Slavery in New York, its largest theme exhibition in 200 years on a topic which it had never addressed before. It included an art exhibit by artists invited to use museum collections in their works.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Society generally focuses on the developing city center on Manhattan Island, and the Long Island Historical Society was founded in 1863. It was later renamed as the Brooklyn Historical Society, located in the borough across the East River. This borough was consolidated into the \\"City of Greater New York\\" in 1898. The BHS also has materials pertaining to the greater city and its region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New-York Historical Society holds an extensive collection of historical artifacts, works of American art, and other materials documenting the history of the United States and New York. It presents deeply researched exhibitions on a variety of topics and periods in American history, such as George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Slavery in New York, The Hudson River School, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Tiffany designer Clara Driscol, and the history of the Constitution. The Historical Society also offers an extensive range of curriculum-based school programs and teacher resources, provides academic fellowships and organizes public programs for adults to foster lifelong learning and a deep appreciation of history.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New-York Historical Societys museum is the oldest in New York City and predates the founding of the Metropolitan Museum of Art by nearly 70 years. Its art holdings comprise more than 1.6 million works. Among them are a world-class collection of Hudson River School paintings, including major works by Thomas Cole and Frederic Edwin Church; iconic genre and history paintings including works by William Sidney Mount and Eastman Johnson; a vast range of American portraits, including paintings by Rembrandt Peale and Gilbert Stuart; all 435 of John James Audubon's extant preparatory watercolors for The Birds of America;[3] and an encyclopedic collection of more than 800 works documenting the full range of representational sculpture in America from the colonial period to the present day.[4] The Historical Society also holds an important collection of paintings and drawings by marine artist James Bard.[5] The museum holds much of sculptor Elie Nadelmans legendary American folk art collection, including furniture and household accessories such as lamps, candlesticks, textiles, glass, and ceramic objects, as well as paintings, toys, weathervanes, sculptural woodcarvings, and chalkware.[6] The Historical Societys holdings in artifacts and decorative arts include George Washington's camp bed from Valley Forge, the desk at which Clement Clarke Moore wrote A Visit from Saint Nicholas, one of the world's largest collections of Tiffany lamps and glasswork, and a collection of more than 550 late nineteenth-century American board games.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIts research library contains more than three million books, pamphlets, maps, atlases, newspapers, broadsides, music sheets, manuscripts, prints, photographs, and architectural drawings. Among its collections are far-ranging materials relating to the founding and early history of the nation including the first documentary evidence of the phrase \\"United States of America\\";[8] one of the best collections of 18th-century newspapers in the United States; an outstanding collection of materials documenting slavery and Reconstruction; an exceptional collection of Civil War material, including Ulysses S. Grants terms of surrender for Robert E. Lee; collections relating to trials in the United States prior to 1860; American fiction, poetry, and belles-lettres prior to 1850; a broad range of materials relating to the history of the circus; and American travel accounts from the colonial era to the present day.[2][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Society operates a website showing many images from its collection.[10] In 2015 it announced the digitization and posting of over a thousand negatives by photographer Robert L. Bracklow from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Historical Society was founded on November 20, 1804, largely through the efforts of John Pintard.[12] He was for some years secretary of the American Academy of Fine Arts, as well as the founder of New York's first savings bank. He was also among the first to agitate for a free school system. The first meeting comprised 11 of the city's most prominent citizens, including Mayor DeWitt Clinton. At the meeting, a committee was selected to draw up a constitution, and by December 10, the Historical Society was officially organized.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Historical Society's first catalogue, printed in 1813, the museum then held 4,265 books, as well as 234 volumes of United States documents, 119 almanacs, 130 titles of newspapers, 134 maps, and 30 miscellaneous views. It had already collected the start of a manuscript collection, several oil portraits and 38 engraved portraits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Historical Society suffered under heavy debt during its early decades. In 1809, it organized a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the arrival of Henry Hudson in New York Harbor. Inspired by the event, the Historical Society petitioned and later obtained an endowment from the New York State Legislature, to be financed by a lottery in 1814. The failure of the lottery resulted in a debt that forced the Society to mortgage some of its books, which were not redeemed until 1823.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Historical Society and its collections moved frequently during the 19th century. In 1809, the Historical Society and its collections moved to the Government House on Bowling Green.  Constructed as a residence for the President of the United States when New York was the temporary capital, the building had been unoccupied since the government's relocation to Philadelphia in 1790. In 1816, the Historical Society moved to the New York Institution, formerly the city almshouse on City Hall Park. In 1857, it moved into the first building constructed specifically for its collections, at the then-fashionable intersection of Second Avenue and 11th Street, where it stayed for the next 50 years. The Historical Society later acquired a collection of Egyptian and Assyrian art, which was eventually transferred to the Brooklyn Museum of Art.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction for its eighth home began September 10, 1902.[13] The central portion of the present building on Central Park West was completed December 15, 1908,[14] to designs by architects York and Sawyer, who were known for their bank designs.  In 1938 that central block was extended and sympathetically completed by the construction of pavilions on either end, with Walker & Gillette as architects. That extension project stands among the last examples of Beaux-Arts architecture completed in the city and in the entire country. The building was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1966.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo notable stained glass windows are found in the library on the 2nd floor. The Arrival of Henry Hudson was designed by Mr. Calvert of the Gorham Manufacturing Company. The second is Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, known as the French Huguenot memorial window, in honor of religious refugees to New York. It is inscribed and signed by the artist, Mary E. Tillinghast.  The window was underwritten by Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage, a philanthropist who was instrumental in commissioning other windows by Tillinghast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Historical Society's collection continued to grow throughout the 20th century, but renewed financial woes in the 1970s and 1980s forced the Historical Society to limit access to its collections to professional researchers. In the 1980s, under the leadership of Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., a private equity financier and Enron board member,[17] the Society was forced to use endowment invasion to pay their annual operating costs and cover their salaries, to the point where by 1988, they had only enough money in their endowment to pay for another 18 months of operating expenses.[18][19] Barbara Knowles Debs from Manhattanville College was named interim director of the Historical Society.[20] In the same year hundreds of paintings, decorative art objects, and other artifacts, which were stored in a Manhattan warehouse, were found to be critically deteriorating. Many of the objects were on long-term loan to the museum.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, grants from the city and state restored public access under the direction of Betsy Gotbaum. Since the late 1990s, the New-York Historical Society has invested significantly in facility and installation upgrades, and conducted fundraising.  It has increased its operating budget by 160 percent to enhance and expand its public programs, while maintaining a balanced budget from 1998 to the present. Recent renovations to the Historical Society include new galleries and exhibition spaces, the Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture, a state-of-the-art library reading room, and a new facility to house and provide access to the letters and manuscripts of the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. In 2005, the Historical Society was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe museum has mounted exhibits on national themes through history in New York. For instance, beginning in 2005 with Slavery and the Making of New York, 1600s ÿ 1827, it mounted the first exhibition ever in New York City on the major but little-known role of slavery in the city's economy and history. During the colonial years, 41% of households had slaves, and much of the city's economy through the Civil War was related to the South and slavery; half of its exports were related to cotton. Devoting the entire first floor to the exhibit, the museum mounted the largest theme exhibit in its 200-year history. It also addressed the strengths of African Americans who resisted slavery and created their own culture, both in New York and the nation.[22] A related part of the exhibit was commissioning 20 new works by invited artists, some of whom used objects from the museum's collections to create new works and installations on this theme.  The second exhibition was New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War, 1827ÿ1865, (November 17, 2006 to September 3, 2007), which explored the economy before the war and strong business ties to the South, events related to the war such as the New York City Draft Riots, and other aspects.  Southerners visited New York so frequently in the antebellum era that they had favorite hotels.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the direction of Louise Mirrer, a three-year, $65 million renovation of the landmark building on Central Park West was completed in 2011 to enhance public access to the institution's resources. On Central Park West, windows were lengthened to form new entrances, with views into the main gallery, and windows were expanded. To establish \\"a street presence,\\" the society has installed life-size bronze sculptures outside the building  Abraham Lincoln on Central Park West, Frederick Douglass on West 77th Street ÿ national figures with connections to New York.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter reopening, the Historical Society offered a multimedia installation of major themes of American history through stories and figures from New York's past. It also has a new section for an interactive children's history museum.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Historical Society uses an archaic spelling of the geographic name of \\"New York\\".  Hyphenating the city's old name was common in the 19th century when the institution was founded, and is still used in this context to provide a unique identity.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New-York Historical Society gives three books prizes annually.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 404645N 735827W? / ?40.77917N 73.97417W? / 40.77917; -73.97417","input":"Where is the new york historical society located?"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},P={class:"card-container"};function B(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",P,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const x=d(M,[["render",B]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/32.md","filePath":"qapage/32.md"}'),R={name:"qapage/32.md"},N=Object.assign(R,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(x)]))}});export{D as __pageData,N as default};
