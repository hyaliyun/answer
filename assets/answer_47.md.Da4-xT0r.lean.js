For example , if two electrons reside in the same orbital , and if their n , l , and m values are the same , then their m must be different , and thus the electrons must have opposite half - integer spin projections of 1 / 2 and − 1 / 2 .

Another name for food web is consumer - resource system . Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels : 1 ) the autotrophs , and 2 ) the heterotrophs . To maintain their bodies , grow , develop , and to reproduce , autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances , including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide . These chemical reactions require energy , which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis , although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs . A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere , to mixotrophs ( such as carnivorous plants ) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere , and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter . The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways , such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs . The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange . There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory , carnivory , scavenging and parasitism . Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs , such as sugars , provides energy . Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes , from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods , and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales ."},{"query":"what are the tennis courts at wimbledon made from","short_answer":"grass","abstract":"A tennis court is the venue where the sport of tennis is played .

The defining characteristic of \`\` common law '' is that it arises as precedent . In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is , a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts , and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts . If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past , the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision ( a principle known as stare decisis ) . If , however , the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases ( called a \`\` matter of first impression '' ) , and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question , judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue ( one party or the other has to win , and on disagreements of law , judges make that decision ) . The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision , and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants . Common law , as the body of law made by judges , stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process , and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch ( the interactions are explained later in this article ) . Stare decisis , the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results , lies at the heart of all common law systems ."},{"query":"where does spirit airlines fly to from myrtle beach","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of destinations that Spirit Airlines serves as of June 2017 ."},{"query":"which is the eighth planet from the sun (in order of increasing mean distance or semimajor axis)","short_answer":"Neptune","abstract":""},{"query":"what is the long walk at windsor castle","short_answer":"","abstract":"Windsor Great Park is a Royal Park of 2,020 hectares ( 5,000 acres ) , including a deer park , to the south of the town of Windsor on the border of Berkshire and Surrey in England .

For example , if , in response to a 10 % increase in the price of fuel , the demand for new cars that are fuel inefficient decreased by 20 % , the cross elasticity of demand would be : cross body − 20 % 10 % = − 2 ( \\\\ displaystyle ( \\\\ frac ( - 20 \\\\ % ) ( 10 \\\\ % ) ) = - 2 ) .

Therefore , if the price of product B decreases , the demand curve for product A shifts to the right reflecting an increase in A 's demand , resulting in a negative value for the cross elasticity of demand . The exact opposite reasoning holds for substitutes ."},{"query":"what colour is made from blue and green","short_answer":"cyan","abstract":"There are two types of color mixing : Additive and Subtractive .

In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily .

Another name for food web is consumer - resource system . Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels : 1 ) the autotrophs , and 2 ) the heterotrophs . To maintain their bodies , grow , develop , and to reproduce , autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances , including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide . These chemical reactions require energy , which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis , although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs . A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere , to mixotrophs ( such as carnivorous plants ) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere , and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter . The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways , such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs . The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange . There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory , carnivory , scavenging and parasitism . Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs , such as sugars , provides energy . Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes , from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods , and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales ."},{"query":"what are some resources that an nos provides","short_answer":"","abstract":"The term network operating system is used to refer to two rather different concepts :"},{"query":"dragon ball super theme song english mp3 free download","short_answer":"","abstract":"Son Goku ( Japanese : 孫 悟空 , Hepburn : Son Gokū ) is a fictional character and main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama .

The South does not fully match the geographic south of the United States but is commonly defined as including the states that fought for the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War . The Deep South is fully located in the southeastern corner . Arizona and New Mexico , which are geographically in the southern part of the country , are rarely considered part , while West Virginia , which separated from Virginia in 1863 , commonly is . Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries . While the states of Delaware and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia , permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War , they remained with the Union . Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s , they became more culturally , economically , and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states , and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast by many residents , businesses , public institutions , and private organizations . However , the United States Census Bureau puts them in the South ."},{"query":"what is the mode of action of aspirin","short_answer":"","abstract":"Aspirin causes several different effects in the body , mainly the reduction of inflammation , analgesia ( relief of pain ) , the prevention of clotting , and the reduction of fever . Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA2 . Aspirin 's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase ( COX ) enzyme . Cyclooxygenase is required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis . Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the COX enzyme . This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs ( such as diclofenac and ibuprofen ) , which are reversible inhibitors . However , other effects of aspirin , such as uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria , and the modulation of signaling through NF - κB , are also being investigated . Some of its effects are like those of salicylic acid , which is not an acetylating agent ."},{"query":"who does alex end up with on one tree hill","short_answer":"","abstract":"The eighth season of One Tree Hill , an American television series , premiered on September 14 , 2010 .

She helped America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers , such as the needs of children , local public health , and world peace . In her essay \`\` Utilization of Women in City Government , '' Jane Addams noted the connection between the workings of government and the household , stating that many departments of government , such as sanitation and the schooling of children , could be traced back to traditional women 's roles in the private sphere . Thus , these were matters of which women would have more knowledge than men , so women needed the vote to best voice their opinions . She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live , they needed to be able to vote to do so effectively . Addams became a role model for middle - class women who volunteered to uplift their communities .

The House of Wisdom is the subject of an active dispute over its functions and existence as a formal academy , an issue complicated by a lack of physical evidence following the collapse of the Abbasid Caliphate and a reliance on corroboration of literary sources to construct a narrative . The House of Wisdom was founded either as a library for the collections of the Caliph Harun al - Rashid in the late 8th century and later turned into a public academy during the reign of Al - Ma'mun or was a private collection created by Al - Mansur ( reign 754 -- 775 ) to house rare books and collections of poetry in both Arabic and Persian .

This period witnessed the foundation of a political entity ruled by the Ottoman Dynasty in the northwestern Anatolian region of Bithynia , and its transformation from a small principality on the Byzantine frontier into an empire spanning the Balkans and Anatolia . For this reason , this period in the empire 's history has been described as the Proto - Imperial Era . Throughout most of this period , the Ottomans were merely one of many competing states in the region , and relied upon the support of local warlords and vassals to maintain control over their realm . By the middle of the fifteenth century the Ottoman sultans were able to accumulate enough personal power and authority to establish a centralized imperial state , a process which was brought to fruition by Sultan Mehmed II ( r . 1451 - 1481 ) . The conquest of Constantinople in 1453 is seen as the symbolic moment when the emerging Ottoman state shifted from a mere principality into an empire , marking a major turning point in its history ."},{"query":"what is the purpose of a viewing at a funeral","short_answer":"","abstract":"In funeral services , a viewing ( sometimes referred to as calling hours , reviewal , funeral visitation or a wake in the United States , Canada and Ireland ) is the time that the family and friends come to see the deceased after they have been prepared by a funeral home .

First , prefixes and suffixes , most of which are derived from ancient Greek or classical Latin , have a droppable - o - . As a general rule , this - o - almost always acts as a joint - stem to connect two consonantal roots , e.g. arthr - + - o - + logy = arthrology . But generally , the - o - is dropped when connecting to a vowel - stem ; e.g. arthr - + itis = arthritis , instead of * arthr - o-itis . Second , medical roots generally go together according to language , i.e. , Greek prefixes occur with Greek suffixes and Latin prefixes with Latin suffixes .

It is usually dated 1935 - 36 , and includes programs to redistribute wealth , income and power in favor of the poor , the old , farmers and labor unions .

Many were ended during World War II because unemployment was no longer a problem . These included the WPA , NYA and the Resettlement Administration .
